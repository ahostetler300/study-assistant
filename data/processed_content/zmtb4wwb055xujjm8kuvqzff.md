t this moment you know several thousand Spanish words even if you have never seen or heard a Spanish word before. You are not aware of these words simply because they have not been pointed out to you. In this book I’m going to show you how easy it is to learn Spanish by showing you how much you already know. For instance, have you ever seen these Spanish words before?

popular
radio
actor

capital
conductor
ideal

animal
probable
flexible

hotel
cable
central

Can you recognize any of these words?

Atlántico
restaurante
optimista

Pacífico
importante
dentista

dramático
presidente
artista

constructive
permanente
confusión

atractivo
medicina
invitaeión

If you can recognize even a few of these words, the Spanish language is yours for the taking.

It is encouraging to know that you can identify thousands upon thousands of Spanish words at sight. But it is really exciting to discover that with a few hints you yourself can form these words and that you can start out on your venture of learning Spanish with a large, ready-made vocabulary. When you study this method you will find that you will not only have the ability to recognize words, but that it will actually be within your power to convert English words into Spanish words.

Furthermore, you will learn what to do with these words. You will feel the thrill of starting right out forming sentences from the very first lesson. You will learn to think in Spanish and you will know the beauty and rhythm of spoken Spanish. When you finish this course you will be able to go to a Spanish-speaking country and talk to the people and understand them.

From the time man first began to learn foreign tongues down to the present time, language methods have relied on memory and not on the pupil’s powers of creation. Now the process is reversed. This book will teach you to create. The very first lesson will prove to you that you can create at least one hundred times more material than you could possibly memorize in the same given time. Furthermore, the process of creation is exciting, whereas mechanical memorizing is tremendously boring. Also consider that you are apt to forget a word that you memorize mechanically. But a word that you create stays with you forever.

The motto of this book, if such there be, is “And gladly wolde he lerne and gladly teche” (Chaucer). From my own experience I know that what is not gladly learned is not learned at all. It is the essence of this method to make learning Spanish a pleasure for you. I have tried to guide you lovingly through the language. Every means of making it easy for you has been incorporated into this book. Thousands of questions that have been asked by former students have made it possible for me to anticipate your questions and to answer them.

Do you believe that you cannot learn a foreign tongue?

Did you study languages in school and fail to learn to speak them?

Do yon know a great many Spanish words that you cannot put into sentences?

Were you ever bored in a language class?

Have you thought that learning a new language involved so much work that it couldn’t fit into your schedule?

If you can answer “yes” to any of the questions above, this method is for you.

This book will teach you to:

* Speak Spanish

* Read Spanish

* Write in Spanish

* Think in Spanish

This is not an empty promise. The method has proved successful with more than a quarter of a million people in the span of a few years. Not one student who has started this method has failed. Some went more slowly than others, but in the end every student learned more Spanish for every hour that he spent with the book than he had thought possible in his fondest dreams.

This method, which has worked with so many students, will work with you. Turn to Lesson I and prove this to yourself right now.

# Pronunciation Key

A     The letter A is always pronounced “ah” as in “Ah, Sweet Mystery.”

E     The letter E is always pronounced “E” as in bet, test, bless.

I      The letter I is always pronounced “EE” as in greet, beet.

O     The letter O is always pronounced “O” as in obey (but without the slightest trace of a U sound. It is a clean, distinct O sound).

U     The letter U is always pronounced “OO” as in cool, pool.

B     1. The letter B is pronounced “B” as in bit.

2. However, when a letter B appears between vowels it is pronounced very softly. In fact, the B between vowels is so soft that your lips hardly touch when you pronounce it. Try pronouncing the word “abundancia” with a very, very soft B.

C     1. The C before A, O, U is hard as the C in can.

2. The C before E or I is soft as the C in cent.

CC     is pronounced “X.” “Acción” is pronounced “axion.”

CH     As in child.

D     1. The letter D is pronounced “D” as in “do.”

2. When the D is the last letter of a word or when it appears between vowels, it is pronounced as the softest TH imaginable. Say the English word “the” several times making the TH very, very soft; then say “ciudad,” pronouncing both D’s with the same soft TH.

G     1. The G before A, O, U is hard as in get.

2. The G before E or I is pronounced H as in hen. “General” is pronounced “heneral.”

H       The H is always silent in Spanish. “Hotel” is pronounced “otel.”

J     The J is pronounced “H” as in hen.

L     The L is pronounced “L” as in let.

LL     The LL is pronounced “Y” as in yes.“Caballo” is pronounced “cabayo”; “llevo” is pronounced “yevo.”

ñ     The ñ is pronounced “NY.” “Cabaña” is pronounced “cabanya” and “señor” is “senyor.”

R     The R is slightly trilled except when it is the first letter in a word, in which case it is strongly trilled.

RR     Always strongly trilled.

T     The T is always pronounced as the “TT” in attractive. “Patio” (pattio), “simpático” (simpáttico).

Y     1. The letter Y is pronounced “Y” as in yet.

2. However, when the letter Y stands alone it is pronounced “EE” as in beet. “Y” means “and” in Spanish.

Z     The Z is pronounced “S” as in sent.

QUE     is pronounced “KE” as in kept.

QUI     is pronounced “KEE” as in keen, keep.

GUE     is pronounced “GUE” as in guest.

GUI     is pronounced “GEE” as in geese.

The rest of the letters are pronounced as they are in English, with only very slight variations.

In some parts of Spain the C before E or I is pronounced “TH,” and the Z is always pronounced “TH.”

el mono (the monkey)

t is very easy to build a large vocabulary of Spanish words. In fact, you already know thousands of English words that become Spanish words if you change them very slightly. These words fall into several large categories.

## CATEGORY I

The first and easiest category is made up of words which end in “or.” These words are often identical in Spanish and English.

Remember: “el” means “the,” “un” means “a” or “an.”

the actor = el actor; an actor = un actor

el actor
el doctor
un tractor
interior

el color
el error
un profesor
exterior

el conducto
el favor
un inventor
superior

NOTE: Spanish words that end in “or” are stressed on the last syllable. Example: doc-TOR. The letter “r” is trilled in Spanish.

## CATEGORY II

Next there is a category of words that end in “al.” These also are often identical in Spanish and English.

the animal = el animal

el animal
central
local
personal

el criminal
comercial
musical
rural

el canal
legal
natural
social

NOTE: Spanish words that end in “al” are stressed on the last syllable. Example: lo-CAL.

## CATEGORY III

Then comes a category of words that end in “ble.” These also are often identical in Spanish and English.

the cable = el cable

el cable
posible
formidable
noble

notable
flexible
probable
horrible

terrible
visible
honorable
inevitable

NOTE: Spanish words that end in “ble” are stressed on the next to the last syllable. EXAMPLE: no-TA-ble.

## CATEGORY IV

A fourth large category is made up from those words that end in “ic” in English. To change them into Spanish simply add the letter “o.”

IC = ICOthe public = el público

el Atlántico
democrático
elástico

el público
artístico
eléctrico

romántico
aristocrático
automático

NOTE: In Spanish the accent never alters the sound of letters. Whenever a letter is accented, stress the letter firmly. Example: PU-bli-co.

## CATEGORY V

Another large category is made up from those words which end in “ent” or “ant.” If you simply add the letter “e” to many of these, they magically become Spanish words.

ENT = ENTEANT = ANTE

the president = el presidente; important = importante

el presidente
excelente
conveniente

el accidente
importante
el elefante

el cliente
diferente
inteligente

NOTE: Words that end in “ent” or “ant” are accented on the next to the last syllable. EXAMPLE: pre-si-DEN-te.

The letter “g” is pronounced “h” as in “hen” when it appears before “e” or “i.” EXAMPLE: “inteligente” is pronounced “intelihcnte.”

Now that you know all these words, let’s see how easy it is to put them into sentences. Just remember that:

“es” means “is” “no es” means “is not” “el” means “the” “un” means “a” or “an”

El actor es popular.

El tenor es romántico.

El presidente es diplomático.

El actor no es un animal.

El elefante es un animal.

El conductor no es insolente.

El doctor es inteligente.

El canal es importante.

El restaurante es excelente.

El criminal es terrible.

El cliente es importante.

El elefante es fantástico.

El cable es urgente.

El hotel es excelente.

NOTE: The letter “h” is always silent in Spanish: “hotel” is pronounced “otel.”

The sentences above can be made into questions by changing the word order. In Spanish you do not say, “Is the actor popular?” You must say, “Is popular the actor?”

EXAMPLES:

¿Es popular el actor? Is the actor popular?

¿Es romántico el tenor? Is the tenor romantic?

¿Es diplomático el presidente? Is the president diplomatic?

¿Es importante el canal? Is the canal important?

## WORDS TO REMEMBER

un, a, an
el estudiante, the student

en mi opinión, in my opinion

## SENTENCE-FORMING EXERCISE

You will find three columns of Spanish words below. Take words from Column 1, Column 2, and Column 3 and form complete sentences with them. For example, take “el actor” from Column 1, “es” from Column 2, and “popular” from Column 3. Put them together and they form the sentence “El actor es popular.” Other sample sentences:

El restaurante es excelente.

El cliente es importante.

El doctor no es terrible.

EXAMPLES:

ENGLISH
SPANISH

You will find “cc” in Spanish but this is not a double “c.” Each “c” is pronounced separately since each belongs to a different syllable. The first “c” has a “k” sound and the second, an “s” sound.

correction = corrección

The two “c’s” go into separate syllables in the following way:

correc–cióninstruc–ciónconstruc–ción

4. In Spanish “tion” always becomes “ción.”

TION = CIÓN

ENGLISH
SPANISH

convention
convención

conventional

These words are wonderful because you don’t have to memorize them or even study them to any extent. By the time you have read the lists aloud you will have mastered the technique of making up words in each of the five different categories.

In Spanish we have both masculine and feminine words. Masculine words take the articles “el” (the) or “un” (a, an).

EXAMPLES:

el doctor, the doctor
un doctor, a doctor

el actor, the actor
un actor, an actor

el dentista, the dentist
un dentista, a dentist

el cable, the cable
un cable, a cable

el animal, the animal
un animal, an animal

The feminine articles are “la” (the) and “una” (a, an).

Spanish words that end in “ión” are feminine and consequently take the feminine articles “la” and “una.”

EXAMPLES:

la conversación, the conversation
una conversación, a conversation.

la opinión, the opinion
una opinión, an opinion

la celebración, the celebration
una celebración, a celebration

## CATEGORY VIII

Remember that if a word ends in “tion” in English, change the “t” to “c” and, presto, you have a Spanish word.

la información
una invitación

la constitución
una institución

la operación
una indicación

la preparación
una composición

la producción
una acción, an acction

la construcción
una reacción

If a word ends in “sion” in English, it ends in “sión” in Spanish also. But don’t forget that you never have a double “s” in Spanish.

SION = SIÓN

la confusión
una comisión

la conclusión
una discusión

la confesión
una decisión

Notice that words which end in “ión” are feminine.

The accent indicates ONLY that the accented letter should be stressed. Notice that the final “o” of every “ión” word has an accent.

## THE PAST TENSE

rdinarily, the present tense is taught first because it comes first in the order of the language. But I feel that the past tense will be more useful to you at this point. So, at the risk of exposing myself to that dreadful epithet, unorthodox, I am jumping feet first with you into the past tense. Once you have mastered it you will have the narrative language that you use every day with your friends. You will be able to tell what you did and saw and how it impressed you. “I did” this or that is the beginning of a story, whereas “I do” thus and such is apt to stop you cold. “I eat a lot” can only be followed by a few unpleasant remarks, but “Last night I had dinner with Joe” opens up endless possibilities.

## SOME EASY VERBS

There are over two hundred nouns that end in “ación” that can be converted into verbs if you simply remove the “ación” and add verb endings.

EXAMPLES:

    Take the noun
 : 
    PREPARACIÓN, preparation

    Remove the “ACIÓN”
 : 
    PREPAR

    Add the letter “É”
 : 
    PREPARÉ, I prepared

NOUNS
REMOVE “ACIÓN”
ADD “É”

la preparación
(prepar)  
preparé, I prepared

la celebración
(celebr)   
celebré, I celebrated

la invitación
(invit)     
invité, I invited

la combinación
(combin) 
combiné, I combined

la conversación
(con vers)
conversé, I conversed

la presentación
(present) 
presenté, I presented

“Yo” is the word for “I” in Spanish, but it is frequently dropped.

Take the noun
 : 
PREPARACIÓN

Remove the “ACIÓN”
 : 
PREPAR

Add the letter “Ó”
 : 
PREPARÓ, you prepared

“Usted” means “you,” but it is frequently dropped.

NOUNS
REMOVE “ACIÓN”
ADD “Ó”

la celebración
(celebr)  
celebró, you celebrated

la invitación
(invit)    
invitó, you invited

la combinación
(combin)
combinó, you combined

la conversación
(convers)
conversó, you conversed

la presentación
(present)
presentó, you presented

Usted preparó. You prepared
¿Preparó usted? Did you prepare?

Usted invitó. You invited
¿Invitó usted? Did you invite?

Usted presentó. You presented
¿Presentó usted? Did you present?

Notice that the word order is inverted in questions.

“Usted” (you) is frequently dropped, but we’ll use it in this lesson so that you will get used to the inverted order of words in questions.

PAST TENSE ENDINGS

For the first person (I)
É

For the second person (you)
Ó

## PAST TENSE (PRETERITE)

ou have already learned that if you are speaking of yourself you must end the verb in “é.”

EXAMPLES:
preparé, I preparedtomé, I tookvisité, I visitedinvité, I invited

When speaking of anybody but yourself (singular), you must end verbs in the letter “ó.”

EXAMPLES:

Roberto preparó la lección. Robert prepared the lesson.

El doctor tomó un taxi. The doctor took a taxi.

El general visitó al presidente. The general visited the president.

¿ Preparó usted la cena? Did you prepare dinner?

Remember, then, that if you speak of yourself you must end the verb in “é” and if you speak of anyone else (singular) you must end the verb in “ó.” This is easy to remember if you say a kind of jingle to yourself: “É for me, Ó for others.”

In order to help you connect the letter “ó” with everything and everybody in the world (except yourself), I have devised a figure which I call the third man. Every time the third man appears before a verb, you can be sure that the verb must certainly end in the letter “ó.”

Allow me to present the third man:

The third man is really the figure of a sleeping man wearing a sombrero. The figure has been drawn in the shape of a number 3 and will appear in the rest of the lessons like this: .

The third man is a versatile fellow. He represents EVERYTHING and EVERYBODY in the world except you. When speaking of a star, a flower, a table, Julius Caesar, or your Aunt Sarah you must use the third man form, that is, you must end the verb in the letter “ó.”

You already know hundreds and hundreds of verbs in English that are also Spanish verbs if you change them very slightly.

“Visité” and “invité” are like the English verbs “visited” and “invited” with the letter “d” dropped. There are a great many verbs in English that can be changed into Spanish in the same way.

Following is a list of these verbs that you can learn virtually at a glance. Notice the little drawing of the third man before every third man form below.

FIRST PERSON
THIRD MAN FORM

usé, I used
 usó, you, he, she used

voté, I voted
 votó, you, he, she voted

inventé, I invented
 inventó, you, he, she invented

importé, I imported
 importó, you, he, she imported

copié, I copied
 copió, you, he, she copied

curé, I cured
 curé, you, he, she cured

examiné, I examined
 examinó, you, he, she examined

noté, I noted, noticed
 notó, you, he, she noted, noticed

presenté, I presented
 presentó, you, he, she presented

comparé, I compared
 comparó, you, he, she compared

combiné, I combined
 combinó, you, he, she combined

causé, I caused
 causó, you, he, she caused

deposité, I deposited
 depositó, you, he, she deposited

insulté, I insulted
 insultó, you, he, she insulted

planté, I planted
 plantó, you, he, she planted

patenté, I patented
 patentó, you, he, she patented

cancelé, I canceled
 canceló, you, he, she canceled

continué, I continued
 continuó, you, he, she continued

There are other verbs that are slightly different from their English equivalents, but that are still very easy to recognize and learn.

recomendé, I recommended
 recomendó, you, he, she recommended

progresé, I progressed
 progresó, you, he, she progressed

anticipé, I anticipated
 anticipó, you, he, she anticipated

acepté, I accepted
 aceptó, you, he, she accepted

cultivé, I cultivated
 cultivó, you, he, she cultivated

dicté, I dictated
 dictó, you, he, she dictated

expresé, I expressed
 expresó, you, he, she expressed

celebré, I celebrated
 celebró, you, he, she celebrated

estudié, I studied
 estudió, you, he, she studied

fotografié, I photographed
 fotografió, you, he, she photographed

confesé, I confessed
 confesó, you, he, she confessed

tosté, I toasted
 tostó, you, he, she toasted

pasé, I passed
 pasó, you, he, she passed

cooperé, I co-operated
 cooperó, you, he, she co-operated

Then there are a great number of verbs that are rarely used in everyday speech in English but that are common, everyday words in Spanish.

comencé, I began
 comenzó, you, he, she began

terminé, I finished
 terminó, you, he, she finished

felicité, I congratulated
 felicitó, you, he, she congratulated

molesté, I bothered
 molestó, you, he, she bothered

entré, I came in, went in, entered
 entró, you, he, she came in, went in, entered

estacioné, I stationed, parked (car)
 estacionó, you, he, she stationed, parked (car)

saludé, I greeted, said “hello”
 saludó, you, he, she greeted, said “hello”

As you can see by all the preceding material in the book, there is a great similarity between English and Spanish. This is of tremendous advantage to you, for it will help you to learn very quickly. But you must press this advantage and give your imagination encouragement. Try to guess the meaning of every Spanish word you encounter. Make up words and sentences. In other words, let yourself go.

Now let’s see how the third man verb form is used: “I voted” is “voté.” But if you wish to say that anyone else in the world voted, you must use the third man verb form “votó.”

El presidente votó.
Mi papá votó.

(The president voted.)
Mi mamá votó.

El doctor votó.
El profesor votó.

El dentista votó.
Roberto votó.

If you wish to ask a question invert the word order.

¿ Votó el presidente?
¿ Votó el actor?

(Did the president vote?)
¿ Votó el profesor?

¿ Votó el general?
¿ Votó usted?

(Did the general vote?)
¿ Votó el dentista?

## WORDS TO REMEMBER

el rancho, the ranch

he best way to learn Spanish is through large concepts and ideas, not through memorizing little isolated words. One idea well established in your mind will give you two hundred verbs forever. And every time you use one of these two hundred verbs you become more automatic in the use of the other hundred ninety-nine!

Memorizing is dull and ineffectual. When you learn twenty verbs by rote you are apt to forget most of them and be bored by all of them. You are annoyed by the fact that you have to sit down and toil over them, and they become your enemies. But when you invent a verb it is your creation; you have made it, and you will always like it.

You are probably saying, “How can I invent a verb? Where do I start?”

Start with words that end in “tion” in English.

1. invitation

2. preparation

3. co-operation

4. imitation

5. continuation

6. recitation

Convert them into Spanish nouns by changing “t” to “c” as you learned in Lesson 2.

1. invitación

2. preparación

3. cooperación

4. imitación

5. continuación

6. recitación

Then remove “ación.”

1. invit — ación

2. prepar — ación

3. cooper — ación

4. imit — ación

5. continu — ación

6. recit — ación

Add “é” for me, “ó” for anybody else (third man).

1. invité,         invitó

2. preparé,      preparó

3. cooperé,      cooperó

4. imité,          imitó

5. continué,     continuó

6. recité,         recitó

Never let a word lie fallow in your mind. The minute you have learned it, try to use it. The mental process of using the word makes it stay with you. Now, let’s take the above words and put them into sentences.

Translate into Spanish:

1. I invited Mary to the party.

2. I prepared dinner last night.

3.  The general co-operated with the president.

4.  The monkey imitated Mary.

5.  Robert recited a poem (un poema) in the class.

Check your sentences with those below to see if they are correct.

1. Invité a María a la fiesta.

2. Preparé la cena anoche.

3.  El general cooperó con el presidente.

4.  El mono imitó a María.

5.  Roberto recitó un poema en la clase.

## EXERCISE IN WRITING

Following is a list of nouns converted into verbs.

* Use a sheet of lined paper that has been divided into three columns, and cover up all but the first (left-hand) column below.

* Drop “ación” from each noun in the first column.

* Add “é” for me (as in the second column below), and write the verb in the first column of your sheet.

* Add “ó” for anybody else, writing the verb in the second column of your sheet.

* Then translate the verb into English.

* Now check your three columns with the three right-hand columns below.

Now that you know the technique of changing “ación” nouns into verbs you are ready to begin working with speed. You can get the most advantage out of these verbs if you learn to form them in the flick of an eyelash.

The best way to learn to change these nouns into verbs quickly is to look at the noun, remove “ación,” and add the letter “é” in one quick mental process. Do not read the noun aloud. Just look at it, change it as quickly as you can, and repeat the verb aloud. As you read the list of nouns, change each into a verb as quickly as you can. You will find that by the time you have reached the end of the list you can change a noun into a verb in a split second.

NOTE: Pronouns are frequently dropped in Spanish. People often drop the “usted” in “¿ Cómo está usted?” and simply say, “¿ Cómo está?” This means “How are you?” and is absolutely complete and correct.

“Está” is a third man form and is used with anybody but yourself.

Está bien.

You are well.

He is well.

She is well.

It’s O.K.

It’s fine.

It’s all right.

¿ Está bien?

Are you well?

Is he well?

Is she well?

Is it O.K.?

No está.

You aren’t here.

He isn’t here.

She isn’t here.

It isn’t here.

You don’t need to say the word “here” in Spanish. You can just say, “No está.”

Está en casa.

You’re at home.

He’s at home.

She’s at home.

el tren

isitar” means “to visit” and is the infinitive of the verb. It is called the infinitive because it is infinite; it doesn’t say who visited or when anyone visited. It goes on forever with no person or time attached to it.

You can form the infinitive of all the verbs you have learned thus far by removing the “é” of the past tense, first person and adding “ar.”

EXAMPLES:

invité, I invited
invitar, to invite

hablé, I talked
hablar, to talk

compré, I bought
comprar, to buy

The infinitive is a very handy form of the verb because in combination with “Voy a” (I’m going to) it expresses future action.

EXAMPLES:

Voy a visitar.
I’m going to visit.

Voy a comprar.
I’m going to buy.

Voy a hablar.
I’m going to talk.

Voy a terminar.
I’m going to finish.

Voy a tomar la cena.
I’m going to have dinner.

Voy a estar en casa.
I’m going to be at home.

(Here you use “estar” because you say WHERE you’re going tobe.)

“Va a” means:

you are going to
are you going to?

he is going to
is he going to?

she is going to
is she going to?

it is going to
is it going to?

EXAMPLES:

 ¿ Va a San Francisco?
Are you going to San Francisco?

 ¿ Va a Cuba?
Are you going to Cuba?

 ¿ Va a la clase?
Are you going to the class?

 ¿ Va a comprar una casa?
Are you going to buy a house?

 ¿ Va a visitar a María?
Are you going to visit Mary?

QUESTIONS
ANSWERS

 ¿ Va a tomar el tren? (Are you going to take the train?)

Sí, voy a estar en Cuba mañana. (Yes, I’m going to be in Cuba tomorrow.)

 ¿ Va al cine? (Are you going to the movies?)
Sí, voy al cine. (Yes, I’m going to the movies.)

## WORDS TO REMEMBER

un boleto, a ticket
naturalmente, naturally

en avión, by plane
probablemente, probably

en tren, by train
mañana, tomorrow

quien, who

BESÉ,
  I kissed

NO BESÉ,
  I didn’t kiss

la fábrica

a a comprar” is a third man form and means:

you are going to buy
are you going to buy?

he is going to buy
is he going to buy?

she is going to buy
is she going to buy?

In fact, it refers to anybody (singular) in the world except yourself.

When pupils reach this point they often ask, “How do you know who’s going to buy, if it can mean so many different persons?” The answer is that people always know the subject of their conversation. If they are talking about Charles, it obviously means that Charles is going to buy. If they are talking about Mary, it means that Mary is going to buy, and so on.

In Spanish you always establish the subject of conversation and continue to talk in the third man form indefinitely. Everyone knows that if you are talking about Charles, everything you say is about Charles, although you don’t mention him again. Then, when you want to change the subject, you mention somebody else. For example, “Is Mary going to San Francisco too?” This starts a whole conversation about Mary.

One day, one of my pupils asked a Mexican visitor, “How do you know what you’re talking about?” The Mexican smiled and answered, “Señorita, Mexicans always know what they’re talking about, don’t Americans?”

* ¿ Va a comprar la casa? Are you going to buy the house?

* ¿ Va a comprar la casa su papá? Is your father going to buy the house?

Notice that the two questions above are identical except that the words “su papá” have been added to the second. This word order is used when asking about a third person in the future.

EXAMPLES:

* ¿ Va a comprar un sombrero? Are you going to buy a hat?

* ¿ Va a comprar un sombrero su mamá? Is your mother going to buy a hat?

* ¿ Va a estacionar el auto? Are you going to park the car?

* ¿ Va a estacionar el auto Roberto? Is Robert going to park the car?

* ¿ Va a tomar un taxi? Are you going to take a taxi?

* ¿ Va a tomar un taxi María? Is Mary going to take a taxi?

Lord Melbourne said, “Wealth is so much the greatest good that Fortune has to bestow that in the Latin and English languages it has usurped her name.”

The use of the word “fortune” to mean both wealth and good luck may indicate that in the eyes of the Romans no one could accumulate a fortune without help from Fortuna, the goddess of chance. Therefore, wealth came from good luck and not necessarily good luck from wealth. Be that as it may, Spanish is a daughter of the Latin language and accepts the relationship between the two words. “Fortuna” means both wealth and good luck in Spanish. “Por fortuna” means fortunately, and “afortunado,” fortunate.

## AGREEMENT OF ADJECTIVES

In Spanish the “o” is a masculine letter and the “a” is a feminine letter. A great many words end in the letter “o” in the masculine and in the letter “a” in the feminine.

When adjectives modify a masculine word they nearly always end in “o.”

EXAMPLE: el hombre romántico, the romantic man

When adjectives modify a feminine word they nearly always end in “a.”

EXAMPLE: la mujer romántica, the romantic woman

Plural nouns must be followed by plural adjectives.

EXAMPLES:
los hombres románticos, the romantic men las mujeres románticas, the romantic women

Adjectives agree with nouns in number and gender.

MASCULINE SINGULAR
MASCULINE PLURAL

el actor famoso
los actores famosos

  (the famous actor)
  (the famous actors)

el hombre generoso
los hombres generosos

  (the generous man)
  (the generous men)

el actor romántico
los actores románticos

  (the romantic actor)

la casa blanca
las casas blancas

  (the white house)
  (the white houses)

la blusa negra
las blusas negras

  (the black blouse)
  (the black blouses)

If an adjective ends in “e,” it can modify singular masculine and feminine words without change. It stays as it is.

el hombre interesante
la mujer interesante

  (the interesting man)
  (the interesting woman)

el sombrero grande
la casa grande

  (the big hat)
  (the big house)

To form the plural of adjectives that end in “e,” add the letter “s.”

## PAST TENSE OF IRREGULAR VERBS

The verb “estar” is irregular.

ESTAR, to be (where, how)

PRESENT TENSE
PAST TENSE

    ESTOY, I am
    ESTUVE, I was

 ESTÁ, you are, he, she, it is
 ESTUVO, you were, he, she, it was

    ESTAMOS, we are
    ESTUVIMOS, we were

 ESTÁN, they, you (pl.) are
 ESTUVIERON, they, you (pl.) were

Estoy ocupado.
Estuve ocupado.

(I am busy.)
(I was busy.)

Estoy cansado.
Estuve cansado.

(I am tired.)
(I was tired.)

Estoy en Cuba.
Estuve en Cuba.

(I am in Cuba.)
(I was in Cuba.)

Estoy con Roberto.
Estuve con Roberto.

(I am with Robert.)
(I was with Robert.)

Estoy en casa.
Estuve en casa.

(I’m at home.)
(I was at home.)

Remember that you use the verb “estar” to say “where” or “how” things or people are.

The verb “tener” (to have) is irregular.

TENER, to have

Now let’s study the pattern of these irregular verbs.

  ESTUVE, I was
  TUVE, I had

 ESTUVO, you were, he, she, it was
 TUVO, you, he, she had

Notice that these verbs end in “e” in the first person and in “o” in the third man form. They have the same endings as regular “ar” verbs in the past tense, except that the final letter has no accent.

Below there is a list of regular “ar” verbs and a list of irregular verbs. Compare the endings of the regular verbs with those of the irregular verbs and you will see that they are alike, except for the fact that the irregular verbs have no accent on the final letter.

Do not try to memorize all these verbs. They will be presented in future lessons. They are used here only to show you that irregular verbs are not the devils they are generally thought to be. Their endings in the past are like the endings of “ar” verbs except that they have no accent.

Perhaps it will comfort you to know that (aside from the verbs you have studied thus far) the above list includes most of the completely irregular verbs of the language that you will need to learn for ordinary conversation and that by the time you learn these verbs well you will have overcome what is considered one of the major obstacles in learning Spanish. I think that when you see these verbs gathered together in a list as they are above, you will agree that they are more friendly than forbidding. All you have to remember is that you must end them all in “e” for the first person singular and “o” for anybody else singular.

In this lesson we will work only with:

  ESTUVE I was
  TUVE I had

 ESTUVO you were, he, she, it was
 TUVO, you, he, she had

## IR, TO GO

here is only one devil verb in Spanish and that is the verb “ir” (to go). It has no rhyme or reason, no logic, and nothing to recommend it except, perhaps, its eccentricity. When you first begin to use the verb in its different forms you may be annoyed with it. But you will soon learn to like it because, although it is very irregular, it will save you work in many ways. This verb, combined with infinitives, is a godsend.

IR, to go

The past tense of “ir” is entirely different from the present but is easy to learn.

NOTE: Remember the subject pronouns are frequently dropped in Spanish. “Yo vine” means “I came,” but you almost always drop the pronoun “yo” and simply say, “Vine.” “¿ Vino usted a la fiesta?” means “Did you come to the party?” but you almost always drop the “usted” and simply say “¿ Vino a la fiesta?” You can either use the word “usted” or drop it. Both forms are absolutely correct and complete. However, you will find that in ordinary conversation Spanish-speaking people almost always drop subject pronouns.

Adjectives must agree with nouns in gender and number.

una colonia explorada, an explored colony

el papel perforado, the perforated paper

el programa variado, the varied program

he estado bailando, I have been dancing

he estado vendiendo, I have been selling

he estado aprendiendo, I have been learning

## SPELLING CHANGES IN VERBS

here are some verbs in Spanish that are regular when you pronounce them but that have irregularities in spelling when you write them. The only purpose of the irregularities in spelling is to keep the verbs regular in their pronunciation.

PAGAR, to pay

PAGUÉ, I paid

PAGÓ, you, he, she paid

Notice that “pagué” ends in “gué” instead of just “gé.” Verbs that end in “gar” in the infinitive end in “gué” in the first person past, in order to retain the hard sound of the “g.” The hard “g” is sometimes indicated in the same way in English. The “g” in “gentle” is soft, and in order to make it hard you spell it “gue” as in “guest.” The “gue” in Spanish is pronounced as the “gue” in “guest.”

INFINITIVE
FIRST PERSON PAST
THIRD PERSON PAST

investigar, to investigate
investigué, I investigated
 investigó, you investigated

cargar, to load
cargué, I loaded
 cargó, you loaded

castigar, to punish
castigué, I punished
 castigó, you punished

fumigar, to fumigate
fumigué, I fumigated
 fumigó, you fumigated

irrigar, to irrigate
irrigué, I irrigated
 irrigó, you irrigated

llegar, to arrive
llegué, I arrived
 llegó you arrived

entregar, to deliver
entregué, I delivered
 entregó, you delivered

navegar, to sail
navegué, I sailed
 navegó, you sailed

jugar, to play (a game)
jugué, I played
 jugó, you played

apagar, to put out (the light)
apagué, I put out (the light)
 apagó, you put out (the light)

obligar, to oblige, force
obligué, I forced
 obligó, you forced

PUBLICAR, to publish
PUBLIQUÉ, I published
 PUBLICÓ, you, he, she published

Notice that “publiqué” ends in “qué” instead of “cé.” Verbs that end in “car” in the infinitive end in “qué” in the first person past, in order to retain the hard “k” sound. The “qué” is pronounced “ke” as in “ kept.”

INFINITIVE
FIRST PERSON PAST
THIRD PERSON PAST

atacar, to attack
ataqué, I attacked
 atacó, you attacked

fabricar, to manufacture
fabriqué, I manufactured
 fabricó, you manufactured

## REVIEW OF VERBS

erb” is derived from the Latin “verbum,” which means “word.” The verb is the master word, the king of words. It is the word that governs, dominates, and breathes life into a sentence.

You cannot speak Spanish correctly without being able to use verbs in all their forms. This is not difficult, however, because Spanish verbs follow a beautiful logic; they are clear, concise, well ordered, and almost perfectly organized.

You have already learned the most useful and important forms of the verb. But before you proceed with other material it is good to assemble all the tenses of the verbs that you already know into one lesson, so that you can review what you have studied. Master the verbs.

In reviewing, you will find one complete “ar” verb in the left-hand column below, and one complete “er” verb in the right-hand column below. The endings and the auxiliary verbs (estoy, he, etc.) have been printed in capital letters so that you can recognize them easily.

AR VERB CAMINAR, to walk
ER VERB APRENDER, to learn

Following is a list of infinitives for you to put into all tenses and forms. Use the model verbs above as a guide.

1. Remove “ar” from each of the following infinitives and write out all the tenses as shown in “caminar,” above. All the letters and words that are printed in capital letters in “caminar” must be added to each “ar” verb.

ganar, to win, earn, gain
llorar, to cry

limpiar, to clean
gritar, to shout, to scream

mandar, to send
tomar, to take

manejar, to drive (a car)
cantar, to sing

pintar, to paint
cocinar, to cook

planchar, to iron
terminar, to finish

lavar, to wash
contestar, to answer

saltar, to jump
arreglar, to arrange

cuidar, to take care of
nadar, to swim

ayudar, to help, to aid
trabajar, to work

alquilar, to rent
hablar, to speak, to talk

dudar, to doubt
comprar, to buy

cambiar, to change
 

pasar, to pass, to spend time, to happen
 

regresar, to return, to come back, to get back
 

dejar, to let, to allow, to leave (a thing or person)
 

llevar, to wear, to carry, to take (someone someplace)
 

bajar, to go down, to get off (a train, plane, bus, etc.)
 

2. Remove “er” from each of the following infinitives and write out all the tenses as shown in “aprender” above. All the letters and words that are printed in capital letters in “aprender” must be added to each “er” verb.

vender, to sell
comprender, to understand

correr, to run
sorprender, to surprise

comer, to eat
prometer, to promise

beber, to drink
barrer, to sweep

coser, to sew
 

“Ir” and “er” verbs are identical in all their forms except one. The first person present of “er” verbs ends in EMOS in the plural.

EXAMPLE: “aprendemos” (WE LEARN). HOWEVER, THE FIRST PERSON PRESENT OF “IR” VERBS ENDS IN “IMOS” IN THE PLURAL.

EXAMPLE: vivimos, we live.

Remove “ir” from each of the following infinitives and write out all the tenses as shown in “aprender” above, but remember to change the first person plural ending of the present to “imos.”

vivir, to live
recibir, to receive

decidir, to decide
persuadir, to persuade

dividir, to divide
asistir, to attend

subir, to go up
discutir, to discuss, to argue

resistir, to resist
interrumpir, to interrupt

You probably will be tempted to skip some of the verbs above because there are so many of them. Resist the temptation. This is by far the most important exercise in the book. MASTER THE VERBS.

The three most important things to remember about verbs are:

1. IN THE PAST TENSE, END ALL VERBS IN “Ó” WHEN SPEAKING ABOUT ANYBODY BUT YOURSELF (SINGULAR).

2. END ALL AUXILIARY VERBS IN “A” WHEN SPEAKING ABOUT ANYBODY BUT YOURSELF (SINGULAR).

va a comprar, anybody (except me) is going to buy

ha comprado, anybody (except me) has bought

está comprando, anybody (except me) is buying

3. VERBS THAT APPEAR IN QUESTIONS ARE GENERALLY IN THE THIRD MAN VERB FORM IN ALL TENSES. You usually ask questions about other people and not about yourself.

## WORDS TO REMEMBER

he estado, I have been
este año, this year

una taza de café, a cup of coffee
contestar, to answer

el trabajo, the work
siempre, always

por dos años, for two years
hermano, brother

Aprendí a nadar. I learned to swim.

Aprendí a manejar el auto. I learned to drive the car. (Use “a” when “aprender” is followed by a verb.)

Aprendí las palabras. I learned the words.

He visto. I have seen (irregular).

He escrito. I have written (irregular).

PRESENT TENSE

AR verb
ER verb

hablar, to speak
vender, to sell

hablO, I speak
vendO, I sell

 hablA, you speak
 vendE, you sell

hablAMOS, we speak
vendEMOS, we sell

 hablAN, they speak
vendEN, they sell

The endings of the above verbs have been printed in capital letters to remind you that in the present tense, the endings of “ar” verbs are based on the letter “a” and the endings of “er” verbs are based on the letter “e,” except for the first person singular, which ends in “o.” In chart form:

PRESENT TENSE

## RADICAL CHANGING VERBS

There are some verbs that are completely regular in their endings but that change in the body (root, stem) of the verb. These verbs are known as “Radical Changing Verbs,” which means root or stem changing verbs.

There are some verbs in which the letter “e” changes to “ie” in the stem.

EXAMPLE:

PENSAR, to think

pIEnso, I think
pensamos, we think

 pIEnsa, you think
 pIEnsan, they think

The changes have been printed in capital letters for your convenience. Notice that the “e” changes to “ie” in all forms of the present except the first person plural. The “e” remains an “e” in the infinitive and in the first person plural and changes to “ie” in the other forms. Following is a chart that shows the connection between the infinitive and the first person plural.

pensar

THE FIRST PERSON PLURAL DOES NOT CHANGE.

The letter “e” does not change to “ie” unless the stress or accent of the word falls upon it. The letter “e” does not receive the stress in “pensamos” or in “pensar,” consequently the “e” does not change to “ie” in these two forms.

CERRAR, to close, to shut

cIErro, I close
cerramos, we close

 cIErra, you close
 cIErran, they close

IN CHART FORM:

cerrar

THE FIRST PERSON PLURAL DOES NOT CHANGE.

These radical changing verbs are regular in the past and in all the other tenses you have learned.

## SAMPLE VERBS

RADICAL CHANGING “AR” VERB
RADICAL CHANGING “ER” VERB

CERRAR, to close, to shut
ENTENDER, to understand

PRESENT (IRREGULAR)
PRESENT (IRREGULAR)

Voy a cerrar
Voy a entender

(I’m going to close)
(I’m going to understand)

He cerrado
He entendido

(I have closed)
(I have understood)

Estoy cerrando
Estoy entendiendo

(I am closing)
(I am understanding)

NOTICE THAT THE “E” CHANGES TO “IE” ONLY IN THE PRESENT TENSE.

There are some verbs in which the letter “o” changes to “ue” in the stem or body of the verb.

EXAMPLE:

ENCONTRAR, to find, to meet, to encounter

encuentro, I find
encontramos, we find

 encuentra, you find
 encuentran, they find

IN CHART FORM:

encontrar

THE FIRST PERSON PLURAL DOES NOT CHANGE. RECORDAR, to remember, to recall

recuerdo, I remember
recordamos, we remember

 recuerda, you remember
 recuerdan, they remember

IN CHART FORM:

recordar

THE FIRST PERSON PLURAL DOES NOT CHANGE. CONTAR, to count, to recount, to tell (a story)

cuento, I count
contamos, we count

 cuenta, you count
 cuentan, they count

IN CHART FORM:

contar

THE FIRST PERSON PLURAL DOES NOT CHANGE.

In one verb the letter “u” changes to “ue.”

jugar, to play (a game)

All these rules and examples can be boiled down to:

I. E = IE O = UE

II. THESE CHANGES OCCUR ONLY IN THE PRESENT TENSE.

III. THE FIRST PERSON PLURAL OF THE PRESENT TENSE DOES NOT CHANGE.

el chiste, the joke

Remember that you can either use the word “usted” or drop it. You can either say “¿Entiende usted?” (Do you understand?) or simply “¿Entiende?” Both of these forms are correct, and both are used in ordinary conversation.

When “antes de” (before) and “después de” (after) are followed by verbs, the infinitive form is used.

antes de estudiar, before studying

antes de tomar la cena, before having dinner

antes de contar el cuento, before telling the story

antes de ir, before going

antes de ver, before seeing

después de recibir la carta, after receiving the letter

después de ver a Elena, after seeing Helen

después de cerrar la puerta, after closing the door

“Antes de” and “después de” are not necessarily followed by verbs. They can be followed by nouns.

antes de la cena, before dinner

antes del desayuno, before breakfast

antes del almuerzo, before lunch

después de la fiesta, after the party

después de la clase, after the class

“Comprender” and “entender” both mean to understand. They are interchangeable. It’s a good idea to study “entender” well, since it is radical changing. Remember that the present tense is:

“Pensar” (to think) expresses the act of thinking, but don’t forget that if you wish to express an opinion and say, “I think,” you must use the verb “creer” (to believe).

Creo que es interesante. I think that it’s interesting.

Creo que sí. I think so.

Creo que no. I think not.

## EXTRA WORDS

## THE NONCONFORMIST VERBS

asically, there are three main groups of verbs in Spanish.

* Regular verbs.

* Radical changing verbs.

* Irregular verbs.

I call the irregular verbs the nonconformists because they don’t conform to the rules and frequently go off half cocked in different directions.

The nonconformist verbs have a sort of club in which they accept only peculiar verbs as members of their society. If a verb has an outstanding idiosyncrasy, it can belong to the nonconformist club. If a verb dares to be regular or even radical changing, the nonconformists will have nothing to do with it, tagging it as “too common.”

“Ir” (to go) is the president of the nonconformist club because it is so completely irregular that you can’t even recognize its different tenses unless you know them, which you do.

The nonconformist club consists of eighteen important members and a few hangers-on.

## NONCONFORMIST VERBS

PAST TENSE (PRETERITE)

You already know the past tense of most of the nonconformist verbs. Of the eighteen verbs, eleven end in “e” in the first person singular of the past and in “o” in the third man form singular of the past. You have already studied these verbs and know that the “e” and the “o” are not accented.

The past tense endings of eleven nonconformist verbs are:

This is the most important chart in the book. It puts the past tense of irregular verbs snugly in your pocket.

Remember that these are the endings of eleven nonconformist verbs. Some are “ar” verbs, some are “er,” and some are “ir” verbs. But they all have the same past tense endings as in the chart above.

PAST TENSE (PRETERITE)

GROUP I

For your convenience, the letters that should be stressed will be in heavy type in the following lists.

 
E
O
IMOS
IERON

  1. tener, to have
tuve
 tuvo
tuvimos
 tuvieron

  2. estar, to be
estuve
 estuvo
estuvimos
 estuvieron

  3. andar, to walk
anduve
 anduvo
anduvimos
 anduvieron

  4. poner, to put
puse
 puso
pusimos
 pusieron

  5. poder, to be able
pude
 pudo
pudimos
 pudieron

  6. saber, to know
supe
 supo
supimos
 supieron

7. venir, to come
vine
 vino
vinimos
 vinieron

  8. hacer, to do
hice
 hizo
hicimos
 hicieron

  9. querer, to want
quise
 quiso
quisimos
 quisieron

10. decir, to say
dije
 dijo
dijimos
 dijeron

11. traer, to bring
traje
 trajo
trajimos
 trajeron

Notice that all the verbs end in “ieron” in the third person plural with the exception of the last two verbs, “dijeron” and “trajeron.” In these two verbs the letter “i” is omitted.

Notice that in the eleven verbs above, the first person of each verb sets the pattern for the entire past tense of the verb.

Once you know that “TUVE” is the first person singular, you can be sure that the three other forms will begin with “TUV.” Only the endings change. Once you establish that the first person of “venir” is “VINE,” you know that all the other forms must begin with “VIN.”

These verbs play a kind of follow-the-leader in their irregularities.

Two of the eighteen nonconformist verbs are completely regular in the past.

12. salir, to go out
salí
 salió
salimos
 salieron

13. ver, to see
ví
 vió
vimos
 vieron

In two of the eighteen verbs the letter “i” changes to “y” when it appears between vowels.

14. oír, to hear
oí
 oyó
oímos
 oyeron

15. caer, to fall
caí
 cayó
caímos
 cayeron

Although “dar” (to give) is an “ar” verb it has “er” endings in the past tense.

16. dar, to give
dí
 dió
dimos
 dieron

You already know the past of “ir.” And if you know the past of “ir,” you know the past of “ser” because they are absolutely identical.

17. ir, to go
fuí
 fué
fuimos
 fueron

18. ser, to be
fuí
 fué
fuimos
 fueron

IMPERFECT TENSE OF SABER AND QUERER

When you wish to say “I wanted” in Spanish you generally use the imperfect tense, “quería.” The imperfect is a past tense that you will learn later on.

IMPERFECT

QUERER, to want, to love

Notice that there is no differenuce between the first person and the third man form in the singular. The entire singular is “quería,” which means: I wanted, you wanted, he wanted, she wanted, it wanted.

When you wish to say, “I knew” in Spanish you use the imperfect tense “sabía.”

IMPERFECT

SABER, to know

Notice that there is no difference between the first person and the third man form in the singular. “Sabía” means: I knew, you knew, he knew, she knew.

PRESENT TENSE OF NONCONFORMIST VERBS

GROUP I

Of the eighteen members, nine end in “go” in the first person singular of the present.

FIRST PERSON SINGULAR, PRESENT
INFINITIVE

TENGO, I have
TENER, to have

VENGO, I come
VENIR, to come

PONGO, I put
PONER, to put

TRAIGO, I bring
TRAER, to bring

CAIGO, I fall
CAER, to fall

DIGO, I say
DECIR, to say

HAGO, I do, I make
HACER, to do, to make

OIGO, I hear
OÍR, to hear

SALGO, I go out
SALIR, to go out

The best way to learn these verb forms is by reciting them in groups of threes. Recite them out loud and learn them just as you would learn a poem.

Stress the heavy-type letters firmly.

tengo
traigo
hago

vengo
caigo
salgo

pongo
oigo
digo

Of these nine verbs, five are regular in the present, except for the first person singular. They are:

PRESENT TENSE

HACER, to do, to make

PONER, to put

SALIR, to go out, to leave (a place)

Two of the nine verbs that end in “go” in the first person singular present are radical changing in all forms except the first person singular present. In these verbs the “e” changes to “ie.”

And the last two verbs are irregular in their own sweet way.

Actually, in “oír” the letter “i” changes to “y,” obeying the

AGE-OLD RULE: The letter “i” changes to “y” when it appears between two vowels.

GROUP II

Of the eighteen nonconformists, four end in “oy” in the first person singular of the present. They are:

VOY, I go
SOY, I am

DOY, I give
ESTOY, I am

1. You already know that the present of “ir” is:

IR, to go

2. You know that the present of “estar” is:

ESTAR, to be (where, how)

3. The present of “dar” is:

DAR, to give

4. “Ser” is the vice-president of the nonconformists. It is a very irregular verb. Its present tense is:

SER, to be

GROUP III

Of the eighteen nonconformists, two are radical changing in the present tense. They made the nonconformist club for irregularities in other tenses.

QUERER, to want, to love

PODER, to be able

GROUP IV

Of the eighteen nonconformists, two are completely different from the others in the first person singular, but aside from that they are regular.

Of the eighteen nonconformists, only one ugly duckling is completely regular in the present tense. “Andar” made the nonconformist club for irregularities in other tenses.

ANDAR, to walk

And then there is one more verb that is completely regular in the present.

18. andar, to walk
ando
 anda
andamos
 andan

This, then, covers the eighteen nonconformist verbs in the present and past tenses. You have seen that, although they are nonconformist, they have many things in common that make them easy to learn. You must pay particular attention to these verbs and learn them well. Among them you will find some of the most used verbs of the Spanish language.

The most important advice that any Spanish teacher could give you is:

MASTER THE NONCONFORMIST VERBS

Nothing you could study before or after these verbs could compare in importance with them. Furthermore, once you have learned them, you will have easy sailing for the rest of your Spanish course.

## USES OF NON-CONFORMIST VERBS

Uses of TENER, to have

In Spanish we do not say, “I’m hungry. I’m cold,” etc. Instead, we say, “I have hunger. I have cold,” etc.

Tengo hambre. I’m hungry (I have hunger).
 ¿Tiene hambre? Are you hungry?

Tengo frío. I’m cold.
 ¿Tiene frío? Are you cold?

Tengo calor. I’m warm.
 ¿Tiene calor? Are you warm?

Tengo sed. I’m thirsty.
 ¿Tiene sed? Are you thirsty?

Tengo sueño. I’m sleepy.
 ¿Tiene sueño? Are you sleepy?

Tengo miedo. I’m afraid (I have fear).
 ¿Tiene miedo? Are you afraid?

Tengo tos. I have a cough.
 ¿Tiene tos? Have you a cough?

Tengo catarro. I have a cold.
 ¿Tiene catarro? Have you a cold?

Tengo razón. I’m right.
 Tiene razón. You are right.

Tengo dolor de estómago. I have a stomach ache.

Tengo dolor de cabeza. I have a headache.

Tengo dolor de muela. I have a toothache.

You can also ask the question “¿Qué tiene?” which means “What’s wrong with him?” (What has he got?) “¿Qué tiene?” means “What’s wrong with you? What’s wrong with him? What’s wrong with her?” “Qué tiene Carlos?” means “What’s wrong with Charles?”

“Tengo ganas de …” means “I feel like …” and is used with the infinitive.

Tengo ganas de nadar. I feel like swimming.

Tuve ganas de nadar. I felt like swimming.

He tenido ganas de nadar. I have felt like swimming.

¿Tiene ganas de nadar? Do you feel like swimming?

“Tener” is also used to express a person’s age.

Tiene un año. He’s a year old (He has one year).

Tiene dos años. He’s two years old.

¿Cuántos años tiene? How old is he? (How many years has he?)

Tiene diez años. He’s ten years old.

Don’t forget that “tiene” is the third man form singular and refers to anybody but yourself.

Tiene quince años.

You’re fifteen years old.

He’s fifteen years old.

She’s fifteen years old.

“Tener que …” means “to have to …”

Tengo que trabajar. I have to work.

“Tener” is used in still another expression: “Tengo mucho que hacer” means “I have a lot to do” (I have a lot of work).

Uses of QUERER, to want, to love.

Remember that “querer” (to want) is used with the infinitive in Spanish just as it’s used in English.

Quiero ver. I want to see.

Quiero ir al cine. I want to go to the movies.

Quería nadar. I wanted to swim.

He querido verlo. I have wanted to see him.

When “querer” means “to love,” it is followed by a personal “a.”

Quiero a mi madre. I love my mother.

Quiero a Roberto. I love Robert.

Elena quería a su esposo. Helen loved her husband.

Luis quería a su esposa. Louis loved his wife.

Queremos al nene. We love the baby (boy).

Quieren a la nena. They love the baby (girl).

Uses of PODER, to be able

Remember that in Spanish we do not say, “I can go”; we say, “puedo ir” (I can to go). ALL FORMS OF “PODER” ARE FOLLOWED BY THE INFINITIVE.

Puedo ver. I can see.

Puedo ir. I can go.

¿Puede estudiar? Can you study?

He podido estudiar. I have been able to study.

No puedo ir. I can’t go.

It is very, very important to remember that all forms of “poder” are followed by the infinitive.

Uses of HACER, to do, to make.

In Spanish we do not say “It’s hot.” Instead, we say, “Hace calor” (It makes heat).

Hace calor. It’s hot.

Hace mucho calor. It’s very hot.

Hace frío. It’s cold.

Hace mucho frío. It’s very cold.

Hizo calor ayer. It was hot yesterday.

Hizo frío ayer. It was cold yesterday.

Hace viento. It’s windy.

¡Qué calor! What heat!

“Hace” is also the equivalent of “ago.”

Hace un momento, a moment ago

Hace una hora, an hour ago

Hace una semana, a week ago

Hace un mes, a month ago

Hace un año, a year ago

Hace mucho tiempo, a long time ago

Hace poco tiempo, a short time ago

Sometimes Spanish-speaking people say, “eight days ago,” instead of “a week ago,” and “fifteen days ago,” instead of “two weeks ago.” Why? Heaven only knows.

Hace ocho días, a week ago (eight days ago)

Hace quince días, two weeks ago (fifteen days ago)

“Hacer” is used in three other common idiomatic expressions.

1. Hacer caso. To pay attention (to make a case) No hace caso. He doesn’t pay attention. No hacen caso. They don’t pay attention.No hice caso. I didn’t pay attention. No hizo caso. You, he, she, didn’t pay attention.

2. Hacer daño. To be bad for (to make harm)Me hace daño. It’s bad for me (It does me harm).Me hace daño la leche. Milk doesn’t agree with me.

3. Hacer falta. To miss (to make a lack), to needMe hace falta Carlos. I miss Charles (Charles makes me a lack).Me hacen falta los niños. I miss the children.Me hizo falta Luis. I missed Louis.

## DIRECT OBJECT PRONOUNS

ost masculine words end in “o” in Spanish. The letter “o” represents the male and is strong, short, vigorous—a commanding letter. Most feminine words end in “a” in Spanish. The “a” is the feminine letter symbol. It is soft, deep, sustained—an elemental letter. When you pronounce the letter “o” cut it off short as in a command. When you pronounce the letter “a” hang on to it as in “Ah, Sweet Mystery.”

THE DIRECT OBJECT PRONOUNS

“Lo” means “him” and “you” (masculine).

“La” means “her” and “you” (feminine).

When you are addressing a man “I invited you” is “Lo invité.”

When you are addressing a woman “I invited you” is “La invité.”

“I invited him” is “Lo invité.”

“I invited her” is “La invité.”

Notice that the pronoun precedes the verb.

All you have to remember about these pronouns is that “lo” is for men and “la” is for women.

Lo visité. I visited him, you (masc.).

La visité. I visited her, you (fem.).

Lo recomendé. I recommended him, you (masc.).

La recomendé. I recommended her, you (fem.).

Lo ví. I saw him, you (masc.).

La ví. I saw her, you (fem.).

Lo visitó. You, he, she visited him.

La visitó. You, he, she visited her.

The plural of these pronouns is formed by adding the letter “s.”

Los visitó. He visited them (masc.).

Las visitó. He visited them (fem.).

When you are speaking of both men and women you use the plural masculine pronoun.

EXAMPLE:

Los ví. I saw you (Mary and John).

Los invité. I invited them (a group of men and women).

“Me” is “me.”
“Nos” is “us.”

 Me invitó. He invited me.
 Nos invitó. He invited us.

 Me visitó. He visited me.
 Nos visitó. He visited us.

 Me vió. He saw me.
 Nos vió. He saw us.

Notice that the pronoun precedes the verb.

THE DIRECT OBJECT PRONOUNS

SINGULAR
PLURAL

ME, me
NOS, us

 LO, him, you (masc.)
 LOS, them, you (masc.)

 LA, her, you (fem.)
 LAS, them, you (fem.)

## WORDS TO REMEMBER

Isabel, Elizabeth
el vals, the waltz

también, also, too
mi abuelo, my grandfather

Lo ví. I saw him.
La ví. I saw her.

la fiesta de Carlos, Charles’s party
¡Qué terrible! How terrible!

 
¿Va su abuelo? Is your grandfather going?

con mucho gusto, with much pleasure, gladly

“Con mucho gusto” is a charming expression that is used very much in Spanish. It is the answer to any honorable invitation.

BAILAR, to dance

Voy a bailar. I’m going to dance.

Estoy bailando. I’m dancing.

Pronouns precede both the auxiliary and the main verb. The auxiliary and the main verb can never, never be separated.

EXAMPLES

Lo he invitado. I have invited him.(NEVER say, “he lo invitado.”)

Los he invitado. I have invited them.

Los estoy castigando. I am punishing them.(NEVER say, “estoy los castigando.”)

LO also means “IT” (masc.).

If “it” refers to a masculine word, use LO.

If “it” refers to a feminine word, use LA.

EXAMPLES:

1. El libro es interesante. Lo í.The book is interesting. I read it.

Since “it” refers to “book,” which is a masculine word in Spanish (el libro), you must use the masculine pronoun for “it,” “lo.”

2. La blusa es bonita. ¿Dónde la compró?The blouse is pretty. Where did you buy it?

Since “it” refers to “blouse,” which is a feminine word in Spanish (la blusa), you must use the feminine word for “it,” “la.”

LAS means “them” (either feminine persons or feminine things).

LOS means “them” (either masculine persons or masculine things).

EXAMPLES:

1. Los artículos son interesantes. Los leí ayer.The articles are interesting. I read them yesterday.

Since “them” refers to “articles,” which is a masculine word in Spanish (los artículos), you must use the masculine pronoun for “them,” “los.”

2. Las blusas son muy bonitas. ¿Las vió?The blouses are very pretty. Did you see them?

Since “them” refers to “blouses,” which is a feminine word in Spanish (las blusas), you must use the feminine pronoun for “them,” “las.”

If “it” refers to an abstract idea, as in “I doubt it,” you must use the masculine pronoun for “it,” “lo.”

EXAMPLES:

Lo dudo. I doubt it.

No lo dudo. I don’t doubt it.

No lo comprendo. I don’t understand it.

Voy a arreglarlo. I’m going to arrange it.

¿Lo arregló? Did you arrange it?

## THE INDIRECT OBJECT PRONOUNS

SINGULAR
PLURAL

      ME, me
      NOS, we

 LE, you, him, her
 LES, you (pl.), they

Verbs that require the indirect object pronouns are as easy as pie to spot. If you can say the word “to” or “for” after the verb in English, it takes “le” in Spanish.

EXAMPLES:

I spoke to him.
Le hablé.

I sang to her.
Le canté.

I bought for him.
Le compré.

I sold to her.
Le vendí.

I wrote to him.
Le escribí.

But it sounds wrong to say:

I kissed to him.

I visited to him.

I invited to her.

So these verbs do not take “le.” They take “lo” or “la.”

I kissed him.
Lo besé.

I visited him.
Lo visité.

I invited her.
La invité.

Your ear is your best friend in learning Spanish. You will find that after hearing certain word combinations a few times your ear will lead you unerringly into the same correct combinations. That is why it is so important to read all the lessons aloud. After you have read a lesson or series of lessons that cover a subject, things begin to sound right or wrong to you. Sometimes you can “let your conscience be your guide,” but in learning Spanish you must let your ear be your guide.

This lesson takes advantage of your English ear, that is, what sounds right or wrong to you in English: “Kissed to him” sounds wrong; “spoke to him” sounds right.

There is only one thing to remember in this lesson. But that one thing is of vital importance: Verbs must be tested IN ENGLISH to determine whether they take “le” or “lo.” I call this the acid test.

Following is an exercise that shows how to give the verbs the acid test. In the left-hand column there is a list of verbs in English.

* Copy the English verbs to form column 1.

* If you can say, “to him” or “for him” after the verb, write either “to him” or “for him” (whichever sounds correct) in the second column. If you cannot say “to him” or “for him” after the verb, write “no” in the second column.

* The third column is the result of the acid test. If you have “to him” or “for him” in the second column, write “le” in the third. If you have “no” in the second column, write “lo, la” in the third.

* Check your columns with those below.

All these exercises, examples, and explanations can be reduced to a simple formula:

TO, FOR = LE

WORD ORDER

Le escribí a mi papá. (To him) I wrote to my father.

Le escribí a mi mamá. (To her) I wrote to my mother.

Notice that you can’t simply say, “I wrote to my mother.” In Spanish you must use both the noun and the pronoun with verbs that take “le.” You must say, “To him I wrote to my father” or “To her I wrote to my mother.”

EXAMPLES:

Le escribí a mi primo. (To him) I wrote to my cousin.

Le compré una pipa a mi abuelo. (For him) I bought a pipe for my grandfather.

Le vendí la casa a Carlos. (To him) I sold the house to Charles.

Le hablé a Roberto. (To him) I talked to Robert.

The same thing happens when you ask a question.

¿Le vendió la casa a Roberto? (To him) Did you sell the house to Robert?

¿Le compró una pipa a su abuelo? (For him) Did you buy a pipe for your grandfather?

The most important thing to remember is that “le” sticks to verbs like a bur.

## WORDS TO REMEMBER

cuándo, when
Le escribí. I wrote to you, him, her.

largo (masc.), larga (fem.) long
Le hablé. I talked to you, him, her.

una carta larga, a long letter

EXAMPLES:

Me lo dió. He gave it to me (To me it he gave).

Me lo vendió. He sold it to me (To me it he sold).

The indirect object LE changes to SE when it is used in combination with LO, LA, LOS, LAS. “Le lo” becomes SE LO.

EXAMPLES:

Se lo dí. I gave it to him (To him [her, you] it I gave).

Se lo vendí. I sold it to you (To you [him, her] it I sold).

Se la vendí. I sold it to her. (The “la” refers to something feminine, such as “la mesa,” the table.)

Se los vendí. I sold them to him. (The “los” refers to something masculine plural.)

Se las vendí. I sold them to you. (The “las” refers to something feminine plural.)

Nos lo vendió. He sold it to us.

Se lo vendí. I sold it to you, to him, to her, to them.

“SE” means: To you, to him, to her, to them.

## NONCONFORMIST VERBS

ME, me (to, for me)

LE, you, him, her (to, for you, him, her)

NOS, us (to, for us)

LES, you (pl.), them (to, for them)

Le traje unos discos. I brought you some records (To you I brought some records).

Le dí el dinero. I gave you the money (To you I gave the money).

Le dimos el libro. We gave you the book (To you we gave the book).

## PAST PERFECT

había terminado (I had finished, you had finished, he had finished)

habíamos terminado (we had finished)

habían terminado (they had finished)

que habíamos terminado (that we had finished)

que habíamos estudiado (that we had studied)

“Dije” (I said) takes “le” because you can say, “said to.” Verbs that can be followed by “to” or “for” take “le.”

Le dije a mi tío que habíamos estudiado. I told my uncle that we had studied (To him I said to my uncle that we had studied).

¿Qué le dijeron a su tío? What did you tell your uncle (What [to him] did you [plural] say to your uncle)?

Le dijimos que habíamos estudiado. We told him that we had studied (To him we said that we had studied).

ALWAYS REMEMBER: Verbs that can be followed by “to” or “for” take “le.”

The object pronouns for nonconformist verbs are:

dar, to give (to)
LE Le dí. I gave (to) him.

traer, to bring (to)
LE Le traje. I brought (to) him.

decir, to say (to)
LE Le dije. I said (to) him.

hacer, to do (to)
LE ¿Qué le hizo? What did you do to him?

Some verbs take either “lo” or “le,” depending on their meaning.

Le traje el libro. I brought the book to him.

Lo traje a la fiesta. I brought him to the party.

If you say that you brought “him,” then you can’t use the word “to.” You can’t say, “I brought to him to the party,” so you can’t use the pronoun “le.”

If you say that you brought a person, use “lo, la.”

If you say that you brought a thing to a person, use “le.”

“Ver” (to see) and “querer” (to love) can’t be followed by “to” or “for,” so they take the direct object pronouns “lo, la.”

La ví. I saw her.
Lo quiero. I love him.

conmigo, with me (with my ego)
con nosotros, with us (masc.)

con usted, with you
con nosotras, with us (fem.)

con él, with him
con ellos, with them (masc.)

con ella, with her
con ellas, with them (fem.)

You can easily recognize them because they all end in “poner.” These verbs have the same irregularities as “poner” in all tenses.

PONGO, I put

There are a few completely irregular verbs that are not included in the membership of the nonconformist club merely because they are not frequently used.

Five other verbs have the same irregularities as “traducir,” above.

## USES OF CONOCER

“Conocer” (to know) is a very rich verb. It is used frequently in conversation and has several different meanings. They are:

1. “Conocer” is used in the sense of knowing people. In this case it takes the personal “a.”

Conozco a Juan. I know John.

Roberto conoce a Elena. Robert knows Helen.

¿ Conoce a Luis? Do you know Louis?

Conocemos a su tío. We know your uncle.

Conocen a su hermana. They know your sister.

“Conocer” takes the personal pronouns “lo, la” because you don’t say “I know to” or “I know for.” (Only verbs that can be followed by “to” or “for” take the indirect pronoun “le.”)

Lo conozco. I know him.

La conozco. I know her.

¿ La conoce? Do you know her?

¿ Lo conoce? Do you know him?

¿ Los conoce? Do you know them?

Lo he conocido por mucho tiempo. I have known him for a long time.

2. “Conocer” is used in the sense of knowing places, such as cities, countries, roads, buildings, etc. In this case “conocer” does not take the personal “a.” The personal “a” is only for persons.

¿ Conoce México? Do you know Mexico?

¿ Conoce la ciudad? Do you know the city?

¿ Conoce el edificio? Do you know the building?

¿ Conoce la carretera? Do you know the highway?

¿ Conoce el camino? Do you know the road?

¿ Conoce el pueblo? Do you know the town?

3. “Conocer” means “to meet” when you are meeting people for the FIRST TIME, that is, when you are being introduced to people. It does not mean to meet people by appointment or to meet people on the street. It only means “to meet” on being introduced.¿ Dónde conoció a Roberto? Where did you meet Robert (Where were you introduced to Robert)?Conocí a Enrique en el barco. I met Henry on the boat.¿ Cuándo lo conoció? When did you meet him?Lo conocí ayer. I met him yesterday.

RECONOCER, to recognize

“Reconocer” also takes the direct object pronouns “lo, la.”Lo reconocí. I recognized him.¿ Lo reconoce? Do you recognize him?

GUSTAR, to like

In Spanish we actually haven’t an expression that can be translated to mean “I like it.” Instead, we use the expression “me gusta,” which really means “it is pleasing TO me.” Since you can say “TO me,” this verb takes the indirect object pronoun “le.”

Me gusta. I like it.
¿ Me gusta? Do I like it?

Le gusta. You, he, she likes it.
¿ Le gusta? Do you like it? Does he, she like it?

Nos gusta. We like it.
¿ Nos gusta? Do we like it?

Les gusta. They like it.
¿ Les gusta? Do they like it?

Notice that the questions and answers are identical; only the punctuation changes. In conversation only the inflection of the voice changes.

Me gusta la música. I like music.

Notice that you use the article “la.” The article is absolutely required before the noun.

Me gusta el café. I like coffee.

Me gusta la leche. I like milk.

Me gusta la carne. I like meat.

Le gusta la ensalada. She likes the salad.

Nos gusta la casa. We like the house.

¿ Le gusta la revista? Do you like the magazine?

¿ Le gusta el garage? Does he like the garage?

¿ Le gusta el vestido? Does she like the dress?

¿ Le gusta el vestido a María? Does Mary like the dress?

A María le gusta el vestido. Mary likes the dress.

In the sentence “Le gusta el vestido” (She likes the dress), if you put the words “a María” before the expression, it makes a statement, “Mary likes the dress.” If you put “a María” after the expression, it makes a question, “Does Mary like the dress?”

Le gusta la casa. He likes the house.

A CARLOS le gusta la casa. Charles likes the house.

¿ Le gusta la casa A CARLOS? Does Charles like the house?

Le gusta la blusa. She likes the blouse.

A MI TÍA le gusta la blusa. My aunt likes the blouse.

¿ Le gusta la blusa A MI TÍA? Does my aunt like the the blouse?

If the person goes before the expression, it makes a statement of fact. If a person goes after the expression, it makes a question. The personal “a” is required in all of these expressions.

Les gusta el té. They like tea.

A LOS INGLESES les gusta el té. The English like tea.

¿ Les gusta el té A LOS INGLESES? Do the English like tea?

“Me gusta” is also used with the infinitive.

Me gusta nadar. I like to swim.

No me gusta trabajar. I don’t like to work.

A mis primos les gusta jugar bridge. My cousins like to play bridge.

IF WHAT YOU LIKE IS PLURAL, “GUSTA” BECOMES PLURAL (GUSTAN).

SINGULAR:
Me gusta la rosa. I like the rose.

PLURAL:
Me gustan las rosas. I like the roses.

I am grateful to you for the favor.Se lo agradezco. I am grateful to you (for it).

## reflexive verbs

ME
myself

 SE
yourself, himself, herself, itself

NOS
ourselves

 SE
yourselves, themselves

The pronouns precede the verbs in all the different tenses. But when the infinitive stands alone the pronoun is added on to it to form one word.

PESARSE, to weigh yourself

PRESENT

PAST (PRETERITE)

FUTURE

PRESENT PERFECT

PRESENT PROGRESSIVE

Verbs that are followed by “myself” are known as reflexive verbs. Reflexive verbs are verbs whose action is directed back upon the subject.

I kicked myself

The action is directed (reflects) back upon me. Therefore the verb is reflexive.

There are many more reflexive verbs in Spanish than there are in English. It is helpful to remember that many of the reflexive verbs that are commonly used in Spanish refer to a PHYSICAL action that is directed back upon the subject. Many of these physical verbs actually involve touching some part of your body.

EXAMPLES:

PHYSICAL VERBS THAT ARE REFLEXIVE

bañarse, to bathe (yourself, himself, herself, itself)

lavarse, to wash (yourself)

peinarse, to comb (yourself)

secarse, to dry (yourself)

afeitarse, to shave (yourself)

pararse, to stand (yourself) up, to stop (yourself)

quitarse, to take off (yourself)

levantarse, to get (yourself) up

ponerse, to put on (yourself)

sentarse, to sit (yourself) down

acostarse, to go (yourself) to bed

*dormirse, to go (yourself) to sleep

*vestirse, to dress (yourself)

*desvestirse, to undress (yourself)

“Sentarse” and “acostarse” are radical changing.

*Don’t try to use the verbs that are marked with asterisks. They have irregularities that will be presented in later lessons. These verbs have been included in the above list in order to give you a more complete concept of physical verbs that are reflexive. One of my pupils once said, “It’s easy for me to remember reflexive verbs because they’re the things I do when I’m getting ready for a party, such as bathe myself, dry myself, shave myself, comb myself, dress myself, and so forth.”

SOMETIMES THE SPANISH REFLEXIVE IS EQUIVALENT TO THE ENGLISH WORD “GET.”

EXAMPLES:

to get better
mejorarse (related to “mejor,” better)

to get married
casarse (related to “casa,” house)

to get tired
cansarse (related to “cansancio,” fatigue)

to get ready
alistarse (related to “listo,” ready)

to get sick
enfermarse (related to “enfermo,” sick)

to get seasick
marearse (related to “mar,” sea)

to get restless
inquietarse (related to “quieto,” quiet)

to get exasperated
exasperarse (related to “exasperación”)

to get enthusiastic
entusiasmarse (related to “entusiasmo,” enthusiasm)

to get fat
engordarse (related to “gordo,” fat)

to get drunk
emborracharse (related to “borracho,” drunk)

to get close
acercarse (related to “cerca de,” close to)

to get frightened
asustarse (related to “susto,” fright)

to get cold
enfriarse (related to “frío,” cold)

NOTE: “Resfriarse” means to catch cold.

PONER, to put, to set (the table), to lay (an egg)

PAST (PRETERITE)

When “poner” is reflexive it becomes a physical verb and means “to put on.”

PAST (PRETERITE)

PONERSE, to put on

Me puse el sombrero. I put on my hat.

Me lavé las manos. I washed my hands.

Notice that in the above sentences you do not say “my hat” or “my hands,” but “the hat” and “the hands.” YOU DO NOT USE POSSESSIVE ADJECTIVES AFTER REFLEXIVE VERBS.

We have covered three points in this lesson.

* Physical verbs such as bathe, get up, shave, and wash are reflexive.

* Reflexive verbs often are equivalent to the word “get” in English.

* Possessive adjectives are not used after reflexive verbs.

## USES OF REFLEXIVE VERBS

1. “Ponerse a” means “to start to” (to put yourself to). It is used with the infinitive.

Me puse a cantar. I started to sing.

Se puso a llorar. He started to cry.

Se pusieron a trabajar. They started to work.

“Ponerse” also means “to become” (to get) when it is followed by an adjective.

Se puso furioso. He got furious. He became furious.

Se puso pálido. He got pale. He became pale.

2. Sometimes reflexive pronouns are used instead of a subject.

EXAMPLES:

Se habla español. Spanish is spoken.

Se permite. It is permitted, allowed.

Se prohibe. It is prohibited, forbidden.

Se necesita una criada. Wanted, a maid (A maid is needed).

The above sentences do not state who speaks, permits, needs, etc. Therefore the reflexive pronoun is used. These expressions are not frequently used in conversation. You’ll find them mostly in signs such as “Se prohibe fumar” (Smoking is forbidden) or in newspaper ads such as “Se necesita una criada” (Maid wanted).

3. The reflexive is also used in what we call reciprocal action, that is, when people do things to each other.

Se besaron. They kissed each other.

Nos vemos. We see each other.

Se parecen. They resemble each other.

No se hablan. They don’t speak to each other.

Se comprenden. They understand each other.

4. You have learned that “I’m going to the theater” is “Voy al teatro” and “He’s going to the movies” is “Va al cine.”When you don’t say where you’re going all forms of the verb “ir” become reflexive.Sometimes you use the word “away” in English when you don’t say where you are going: “I’m going away.”

IRSE, to go (away)

Me fuí con Roberto. I went (away) with Robert.

Se fué solo. He went (away) alone.

Me voy. I’m going (away).

¿Por qué se fué? Why did you go (away)?

“Ya” means “already, now,” and it’s used very much with the different forms of “ir.”

Ya me voy. I’m going now.
 Ya se van. They’re going now.

 Ya se va. He’s going now.
 Ya se fueron. They’ve already gone (left).

Ya nos vamos. We’re going now.
 Ya se fué. He’s already gone (left).

## LIST OF REFLEXIVE VERBS

LLAMARSE, to be called

Me llamo Elena. I’m called Helen (My name is Helen).

¿Comó se llama? How are you called (What’s your name)?

Se llama Carlos. He’s called Charles (His name is Charles).

“Llamar” means “to call” when it isn’t reflexive and “to be called” when it is reflexive.

RUBORIZARSE, to blush, to flush

VOLVERSE, to become

CUIDARSE, to take care of yourself, to be careful

Se va a cuidar. He’s going to take care of himself.

PERDERSE, to get lost

Se perdió. You, he, she, it got lost.

In the future form the pronoun can go either after or before the verb. Use whichever seems more comfortable to you.

EXAMPLES:

I’m going to weigh myself.
{
Voy a pesarme.orMe voy a pesar.

You’re going to weigh yourself.
{
Va a pesarse.orSe va a pesar.

We’re going to weigh ourselves.
{
Vamos a pesarnos.orNos vamos a pesar.

They’re going to weigh themselves.
{
Van a pesarse.orSe van a pesar.

Once in a while you will hear a Spanish-speaking person say. “Estoy pesándome,” thereby adding the pronoun to the present participle. This is correct, but of less frequent use than the construction where the pronoun precedes both verbs: Me estoy pesando.

# 

## THE IMPERFECT

n English there is only one simple past tense, but in Spanish these are two simple tenses that express the past: the preterite and the imperfect.

The preterite is used to express a single completed action in the past and can best be described by a dot.

PRETERITE (Single completed action)

Escribí una carta.
I wrote a letter.

Tomé la cena.
I had dinner.

Compré la casa.
I bought the house.

Tuve un accidente.
I had an accident.

The imperfect, on the other hand, is used to express continuous or repeated action in the past and can be described by a long, continuous line or by a series of dashes. The line represents continuity. The dashes represent repetition.

IMPERFECT (1. Continuous action)

Tenía un auto.
I had a car.

Quería a su madre.
He loved his mother.

(2. Repeated action)

Escribía una carta todos los días. I used to write a letter every day. Mi primo siempre tomaba la cena en el mismo restaurante. My cousin always used to have dinner in the same restaurant.

Mi primo compraba el períodico todas las mañanas. My cousin bought (used to buy) the newspaper every morning.

The verb endings for the imperfect tense are:

Examples:

COMPRAR, to buy

VENDER, to sell

Notice that there is no difference between the first person and the third man form in the singular.

## THE COMMAND

here is a special verb form in Spanish that must be used when you wish to give a command.

The endings for the command form of the verb are:

E for AR verbs

A for ER and IR verbs

EXAMPLES:

hablar,  to speak
hable,  speak
hable despacio, por favor,  speak slowly, please

contestar,  to answer
conteste,  answer
conteste el teléfono, por favor,  answer the phone, please

abrir,  to open
abra,  open
abra la ventana, por favor,  open the window, please

Pronouns are added on to the verbs in the command form.

EXAMPLES:

levantarse,  to get up
levántese,  get up
levántese temprano,  get up early

escribir,  to write
escríbame,  write to me
escríbame pronto,  write to me soon

Radical changing verbs have the same changes in the command form as they have in the present tense.

E = IEO = UE

EXAMPLES:

INFINITIVE
PRESENT
COMMAND
COMMON EXPRESSION

cerrar (to close)
cierro (I close)
cierre (close)
cierre la ventana (close the window)

sentarse (to sit down)
me siento (I sit down)
siéntese (sit down)
siéntese, por favor (sit down, please)

contar (to count)
cuento (I count)
cuente (count)
cuente conmigo (count on me [with me])

soltar (to let go)
suelto (I let go)
suelte (let go)
suélteme (let go of me)

Most of the nonconformist verbs have the same irregularities in the command form as they have in the first person singular of the present tense.

INFINITIVE
PRESENT
COMMAND
COMMON EXPRESSION

venir,
vengo,
venga,
venga acá,

to come

go out (get out) of the house

oír,
oigo,

to hear, to listen
I hear, listen
hear, listen

traer,
traigo,
traiga,
tráigamelo,

to bring
I bring
bring
bring me it, it to me

andar,
ando,
ande,
ande,

to walk, to go
I walk, I go
walk, go
oh, go on

Pronouns are attached to the command form except when the command is negative.

AFFIRMATIVE
NEGATIVE

dígame, tell me
no me diga, don’t tell me

siéntese, sit down
no se siente, don’t sit down

suéltelo, let go of it
no lo suelte, don’t let go of it

póngalo, put it
no lo ponga, don’t put it

tráigamelo, bring it to me (me it)
no me lo traiga, don’t bring it to me

levántese, get up
no se levante, don’t get up

báñese, bathe, take a bath
no se bañe, don’t take a bath

acuéstese, go to bed
no se acueste, don’t go to bed

You have learned that there are three kinds of verbs in Spanish:

1. Regular Verbs

2. Radical Changing Verbs

3. Nonconformist Verbs

The first person singular present of all these verbs is identical to the command, except for the final letter. Always try to associate the command with the first person present.

EXAMPLES:

REGULAR VERBS

INFINITIVE
PRESENT
COMMAND

tomar, to take
tomo, I take
tome

vender, to sell
vendo, I sell
venda

escribir, to write
escribo, I write
escriba

RADICAL CHANGING VERBS

INFINITIVE
PRESENT
COMMAND

cerrar, to close
cierro, I close
cierre

contar, to count
cuento, I count
cuente

recordar, to remember
recuerdo, I remember
recuerde

NONCONFORMIST VERBS

INFINITIVE
PRESENT
COMMAND

venir, to come
vengo, I come
venga

hacer, to do
hago, I do
haga

traer, to bring
traigo, I bring
traiga

If you associate the command with the present tense, you can’t go wrong.

There are only a very few exceptions to this rule and they are:

“Dar” (to give) and “estar” (to be) are regular in the command, although they are nonconformist verbs. However, they did not deign to be completely regular, since they belong to the select nonconformist club, so they both have accents.

dar, to give
dé, give
démelo, give it to me

estar, to be
esté, be
esté contento, be happy

“Ir” (to go) and “ser” (to be) are completely irregular:

ir, to go
voy, I go
vaya, go
vaya a la tienda, go to the store

ser, to be
soy, I am
sea, be
no sea indiscreto, don’t be indiscreet

This whole lesson can be reduced to three points.

1. The command is like the first person singular present, except for the final letter.

2. The commands that are not like the first person singular present are:

estar
dar
ir
ser

(esté)
(dé)
(vaya)
(sea)

3. In the command, pronouns are attached to the verbs except when the command is negative.

SPELLING CHANGES IN THE COMMAND (orthographic changes)

Verbs that end in “gar” in the infinitive, end in “gue” in the command. This change is made in order to retain the hard sound of the “g.” The “gue” is pronounced “gue” as in “guest.”

INFINITIVE
COMMAND

pagar, to pay
pague

llegar, to arrive
llegue

investigar, to investigate
investigue

castigar, to punish
castigue

entregar, to deliver
entregue

apagar, to put out (the light)
apague

*jugar, to play (a game)
juegue

* Notice that “jugar” is radical changing. The “u” changes to “ue.”

Verbs that end in “car” in the infinitive end in “que” in the command. This change is made in order to retain the hard “k” sound.

The “que” is pronounced “ke” as in “kept.”

INFINITIVE
COMMAND

sacar, to take out
saque

tocar, to play (an instrument)
toque

criticar, to criticize
critique

practicar, to practice
practique

marcar, to mark
marque

explicar, to explain
explique

indicar, to indicate, to point out
indique

lubricar, to lubricate
lubrique

CER verbs

You have learned that the command is like the first person singular present except for the final letter. This is true of “cer” verbs, which end in “zco” in the first person present.

INFINITIVE
PRESENT
COMMAND

conocer, to know
conozco, I know
conozca

obedecer, to obey
obedezco, I obey
obedezca

ofrecer, to offer
ofrezco, I offer
ofrezca

establecer, to establish
establezco, I establish
establezca

The command form is called the “imperative” in English.

Spanish grammarians call it the “subjunctive used as imperative.” I prefer to use the word “command” because it conveys the meaning clearly and because it is easy to remember.

COMMON USES OF THE COMMAND

Levántese. Get up.
Tráigamelo. Bring it to me.

Siéntese. Sit down.
Apúrese. Hurry up (from “apurarse,” to hurry).

## THE PRESENT SUBJUNCTIVE

he he verb endings for the present subjunctive and the command are absolutely identical in all verbs. I am very happy to tell you that since you know the command you also know the present subjunctive. The only thing you will have to learn now is the use of the subjunctive.

## USES OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE — PART I

The subjunctive is used after certain definite expressions:

1. QUIERO QUE,
I want you toI want him, her, it to

2. ESPERO QUE,
I hope that you willI hope that he, she, it will

3. DUDO QUE,
I doubt that you willI doubt that he, she, it will

4. TEMO QUE,
I fear that you willI fear that he, she, it willI am afraid that you, he, she, it will

5. PREFIERO QUE,
I prefer that you, he, she, it

6. SIENTO QUE,
I am sorry, I regret that you, he, she, it will

Remember that in the command and in the subjunctive “ar” verbs end in “e,” “er” and “ir” verbs end in “a”.

AR verbs, EER and IR verbs, A

Remember also that the subjunctive and the first person singular present are alike except for the final letter.

You have learned several expressions that must be followed by the subjunctive in this lesson. No doubt you have noticed that all these expressions involve two people; ONE PERSON who fears, wants, doubts, hopes, or prefers that ANOTHER PERSON will do something.

Don’t confuse these subjunctive expressions that involve TWO people with the expressions that you have already learned that involve only ONE person.

ONE PERSON—INFINITIVE

* Quiero ir. I want to go.

* Alberto quiere cantar. Albert wants to sing.

* Elena quiere terminar. Helen wants to finish.

* Espero ir. I hope to go.

* Prefiero caminar. I prefer to walk.

* Marta prefiere caminar. Martha prefers to walk.

TWO PERSONS—SUBJUNCTIVE

* Quiero que vaya. I want you to go.

* Alberto quiere que cante. Albert wants me to sing.

* Elena quiere que termine. Helen wants you to finish.

* Espero que vaya. I hope that he will go.

* Prefiero que camine. I prefer that you walk.

* Marta prefiere que camine. Martha prefers that you walk.

Notice that when the action involves one person you use the verb alone (quiero). But when the action involves two people the verb is followed by “que” (quiero que).

## USES OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE—PART II

“Es” when followed by an adjective or a noun and the word “que” requires the subjunctive.

EXAMPLES:

* ES NECESARIO QUE (it’s necessary that) is followed by the subjunctive.

* ES BUENO QUE (it’s good that) is followed by the subjunctive.

* ES MALO QUE (it’s bad that) is followed by the subjunctive.

Use the following words to fill in the blanks below.

* necesario, necessary

* terrible, terrible

* posible, possible

* increíble, incredible

* raro, strange

* extraordinario, extraordinary

* lástima, a pity, too bad, a shame

* bueno, good

* malo, bad

* probable, probable

* triste, sad

* preferible, preferable

* natural, natural

* imperativo, imperative

Es___________que lo haga.

(It’s     that he do it, that he does it, that he should do it.)

Es____________que lo hagan.

(It’s     that they do it, that they should do it.)

## EXERCISE IN TRANSLATION IV

Translate the following sentences into Spanish. Remember that “es” followed by an adjective or a noun and the word “que” requires the subjunctive.

* It’s necessary that he do it.

* It’s terrible that he should do it.

* It’s possible that he does it.

* It’s incredible that he should do it.

* It’s a pity that they do it.

* It’s preferable that they do it.

* It’s natural that he should do it.

* It’s good that he should do it.

Check your sentences with the translations below.

* Es necesario que lo haga.

* Es terrible que lo haga.

* Es posible que lo haga.

* Es increíble que lo haga.

* Es lástima que lo hagan.

* Es preferible que lo hagan.

* Es natural que lo haga.

* Es bucno que lo haga.

Another expression that requires the subjunctive is:

“que,” let, may (with the subjunctive).

EXAMPLES:

Que cante. Let him sing. Let her sing.

Que venga. Let him come. Let her come.

Que lo haga. Let him do it. Let her do it.

Que haga lo que quiera. Let him do what he wants. Let her do what she wants.

Que lo compre. Let him buy it. Let her buy it.

Que lo piense. Let him, her think it over.

Que salga. Let him go out. Let her go out.

Que tenga suerte. May he, she have luck.

Que llegue a tiempo. May he, she get there on time.

Que vuelva pronto. May he come back soon.

Que canten. Let them sing.

Que vengan. Let them come.

Que lo hagan. Let them do it.

Que lo piensen. Let them think it over.

Que tengan suerte. May they have luck.

The expression “May they” (que) belongs to a whole subjunctive family that expresses hope, desire, or a sincere wish that heaven be on your side.

THE FAMILY OF HOPE

* ESPERO QUE (I hope that) is followed by the subjunctive.

* QUE (May you, he, she, they) is followed by the subjunctive.

* DIOS QUIERA QUE (God grant, want that, God be willing that) is followed by the subjunctive.

* OJALÁ QUE (I certainly hope that, Oh Allah that) is followed by the subjunctive.

This last expression was borrowed from the Moors who lived in Spain for eight centuries (711–1492).

EXAMPLES:

* Espero que tenga suerte. I hope that you’ll have luck.

* Que tenga suerte. May you have luck.

* Dios quiera que tenga suerte. God grant that you have luck.

* Ojalá que tenga suerte. I certainly hope that you’ll have luck.

REQUEST, PREFERENCE, COMMAND

In Spanish an expression that states that somebody wants you to do something requires the subjunctive. This ranges from the most delicate request or preference to the most authoritative command.

* QUIERE QUE mande. He wants you to send.

* DICE QUE mande. He says that you should send.

* PREFIERE QUE mande. He prefers that you should send.

* PIDE QUE mande. He asks you to send.

* EXIGE QUE mande. He demands that you send.

* LE RUEGA QUE mande. He begs you to send.

* LE SUPLICA QUE mande. He begs you to send.

* PROPONE QUE mande. He proposes that you send.

* PROHIBE QUE mande. He forbids you to send.

Notice that the above expressions involve two people.

Notice also that all the verbs above are followed by “que” and that they are all commands in one degree or another. “Dice que es bonito” (He says that it’s pretty) is not a command; therefore it does not belong to the above group.

* Ojalá que vengan a la fiesta.

* Dios quiera que vea a su hijo.

* Dice que mande el dinero.

* Dice que vaya al despacho.

* Dicen que termine el trabajo.

Remember that “dice” is followed by the subjunctive ONLY when it is used as a command.

THE INDEFINITE OR UNKNOWN FAMILY

When you speak of an indefinite or unknown person, place, or thing you must use the subjunctive.

EXAMPLES:

PERSONS UNKNOWN

* I want a maid who will do the work well.Quiero una criada que haga el trabajo bien.Since you don’t know who the maid will be you must use the subjunctive.

* I want a secretary who won’t talk all the time.Quiero una secretaria que no hable todo el tiempo.Since you don’t know who the secretary will be you must use the subjunctive.

* Serve coffee to those who come (anybody who comes).Sírvales café a los que vengan.Since you don’t know who they will be you must use the subjunctive.

THINGS AND PLACES UNKNOWN

* I wani a house that has a fireplace.Quiero una casa que tenga chimenea.Since you don’t know which house it will be you must use the subjunctive.

* I want a house that is near the station.Quiero una casa que esté cerca de la estación.Since you don’t know which house it will be you must use the subjunctive.

* Let them say what they will (say).Que digan lo que digan.Since you don’t know what they will say you must use the subjunctive.

* Let them do what they will (do).Que hagan lo que hagan.Since you don’t know what they will do you must use the subjunctive.

* Let them do what they want.Que hagan lo que quieran.Since you don’t know what they will want to do you must use the subjunctive.

THE SUBJUNCTIVE EXPRESSES ACTION THAT HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE

CUANDO (when), followed by action in the future, requires the subjunctive.

EXAMPLES:

* when he comes (in the future), cuando venga

* when he does it (in the future), cuando lo haga

* when he arrives (in the future), cuando llegue

* when he hears it (in the future), cuando lo oiga

When “cuando” is not followed by action in the future it does not require the subjunctive. “When he did it” (cuando lo hizo) is an accomplished fact. The action has taken place, therefore it is not expressed in the subjunctive. The subjunctive is used to express the uncertainty of an action that has not taken place.

HASTA QUE (until) requires the subjunctive when followed by action in the future. Hasta que venga. Until he comes; Hasta que lo haga, Until he does it.

SUBJUNCTIVE

Quédese hasta que termine el trabajo. Stay until you finish the work.

NOT SUBJUNCTIVE

Se quedó hasta que terminó el trabajo. He stayed until he finished the work. This sentence is not in the subjunctive because “hasta que” is NOT followed by action in the future.

AUNQUE (even though, even if) requires the subjunctive when followed by action in the future.Aunque venga. Even if he comes; Aunque vaya. Even if he goes.

CONTAL QUE (provided that) requires the subjunctive.Con tal que se quede. Provided that he stays.

PARA QUE (so that) requires the subjunctive when it expresses the purpose of an action.Lo cuidamos para que no se enferme. We take care of him so that he won’t get sick.

THE “MAYBE” FAMILY

All expressions that mean “maybe” are followed by the subjunctive.

* TAL VEZ (maybe)Tal vez venga. Maybe he’ll come.

* QUIZÁ, QUIZÁS (maybe)Quizá lo haga. Maybe he’ll do it.Quizás venga. Maybe he’ll come.

* ES POSIBLE QUE (it is possible that)Es posible que termine. It’s possible that he will finish.

* POSIBLEMENTE (possibly)

* PUEDE SER QUE (it may be that)Puede ser que hable con mi tío. It may be that he will talk to my uncle.

* PUEDE QUE (it may be that)Puede que visite a mi tío. It may be that he will visit my uncle.

PRESENT INDICATIVE
PRESENT SUBJUNCTIVE

Quiero que________________________________compre la casa.

I want you________________________________to buy the house.

PAST IMPERFECT
PAST SUBJUNCTIVE

Quería que________________________________comprara la casa.

I wanted you________________________________to buy the house.

The following expressions require the past subjunctive because they are in the past. These expressions are usually used in the imperfect as below:

* QUERÍA QUE, I wanted you, him, her, to …

* ESPERABA QUE, I hoped that you, he, she would …

* DUDABA QUE, I doubted that you, he, she would …

* TEMÍA QUE, I feared that you, he, she would …

When you speak of indefinite or unknown persons or things in the past use the past subjunctive.

* I wanted a secretary who wouldn’t talk all the time.Quería una secretaria que no hablara todo el tiempo.

* He wanted a house that was near the station.Quería una casa que estuviera cerca de la estación.

Remember that the subjunctive is used when an action has not taken place. If an action has taken place, you do not use the subjunctive.

If the following expressions refer to the past, they are followed by the past subjunctive PROVIDED THAT THEY DO NOT EXPRESS AN ACTION THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE.

1. HASTA QUE (until)

EXAMPLE:

We wanted him to stay until he finished the work. Queríamos que se quedara hasta que terminara el trabajo.2. AUNQUE (even though, even if)

EXAMPLE:

We wanted to play tennis even if it rained. Queríamos jugar tenis aunque lloviera. (from the verb “llover” to rain)3. CON TAL QUE (provided that)

EXAMPLE:

She wanted him to do it, provided he would do it well. Quería que lo hiciera, contal que lo hiciera bien.4. PARA QUE (so that)

EXAMPLE:

We told him to leave early so that he would get here on time. Le dijimos que saliera temprano para que llegara a tiempo.5. SI (if)

When you express an “iffy” wish, that is, a wish which begins with the word “if” (si), the verb which follows “if” must always be in the past subjunctive.

EXAMPLES:

If I were king!¡Si fuera rey!

If he would (only) do it!¡Si lo hiciera!

If I (only) had the money!¡Si tuviera el dinero!

If I (only) could!¡Si pudiera!

If you would understand!

¡Si comprendiera!

## THE CONDITIONAL AND THE PAST SUBJUNCTIVE

The conditional of “hablar” is:

To form the conditional of “ar,” “er,” and “ir” verbs, add the following endings to the COMPLETE INFINITIVE:

EXAMPLES:

COMPRAR, to buy

VENDER, to sell

IR, to go

LEER, to read

The conditional is used with the past subjunctive in the following way:

CONDITIONAL + (IF) PAST SUBJUNCTIVE

IRÍA a México…………………SI FUERA posible.

I would go to Mexico………………if it were possible.

This order can be reversed:

(IF) PAST SUBJUNCTIVE + CONDITIONAL

SI FUERA posible, …………………IRÍA a México

If it were possible,………………I would go to Mexico

EXAMPLES:

* Leería el libro si fuera interesante.I would read the book if it were interesting.

* Escribiría una carta si tuviera tiempo.I would write a letter if I had time.

* Compraría un aeroplano si fuera posible.I would buy an airplane if it were possible.

* Si fuera posible, compraría un aeroplano.If it were possible, I would buy an airplane.

There are a few verbs that are irregular in the conditional.

INFINITIVE
CONDITIONAL

tener, to have
tendría, I would have

venir, to come
vendría, I would come

poner, to put
pondría, I would put

poder, to be able to
podría, I would be able to

saber, to know
sabría, I would know

hacer, to do
haría, I would do

querer, to want
querría, I would want

decir, to say
diría, I would say

salir, to go out
saldría, I would go out

Notice that these verbs are all nonconformist verbs.

## COMPOUND SUBJUNCTIVE

You have learned the present perfect tense (indicative).

EXAMPLES:

He estudiado. I have studied

Ha estudiado. You have studied.

Hemos estudiado. We have studied.

Han terminado. They have finished.

In Spanish when you say “I HOPE THAT you have studied” the “have studied” is subjunctive.

I hope that you have studied. Espero que haya estudiado.

I hope that he has finished. Espero que haya terminado.

Whenever you say that you hope (in the present) that something happened (in the past) you use the compound subjunctive.

IN THE PRESENT

AUXILIARY VERB “HABER”

PRESENT PERFECT INDICATIVE

PRESENT PERFECT SUBJUNCTIVE

* I have prepared the lesson.He preparado la lección.I hope that you have prepared the lesson.Espero que haya preparado la lección.

* We have finished the work.Hemos terminado el trabajo.I hope that we have finished the work.Espero que hayamos terminado el trabajo.

* They have paid the bill.Han pagado la cuenta.I hope that they have paid the bill.Espero que hayan pagado la cuenta.The past participle never changes in compound tenses.

AR verb

ER verb

Notice that the participles (comprado, vendido) do not change. Only the auxiliary changes.

The subjunctive present perfect is used with the following expressions.

* ESPERO QUE (I hope that), when you hope that something happened or has happened in the past.

* DUDO QUE (I doubt that), when you doubt that something happened or has happened in the past.

* TEMO QUE (I fear that), when you fear that something happened or has happened in the past.

* SIENTO QUE (I’m sorry that, I regret that), when you are sorry that something has happened in the past.

* NO CREO QUE (I don’t think that), when you don’t think that something happened or has happened in the past.

* AUNQUE (even though, even if), when followed by the auxiliary “have.” Aunque haya trabajado, even though you have worked.

* CUANDO (when), when followed by the auxiliary “have” or “has.” Example: When you have finished, Cuando haya terminado.

* CON TAL QUE (provided), when followed by the auxiliary “have” or “has.” Example: Provided he has read the book, Con tal que haya leído el libro.

* “Es” followed by any adjective or noun and the word “que” requires the present perfect subjunctive when followed by the auxiliary “have” or “has.” EXAMPLE: ES POSIBLE QUE (It is possible that), when followed by the auxiliary “have” or “has.” It is possible that he has read the book. Es posible que haya leído el libro.

## PAST PERFECT SUBJUNCTIVE

PAST PERFECT INDICATIVE

PAST PERFECT SUBJUNCTIVE

The past perfect subjunctive is used in the following construction:

I WOULD HAVE______________IF I HAD______________

HUBIERA______________SI HUBIERA______________

EXAMPLES:

* I would have known the lesson if I had studied.Hubiera sabido la lección si hubiera estudiado.

* I would have spoken Spanish if I had studied.Hubiera hablado español si hubiera estudiado.

* I would have gone to Mexico if I had had time.Hubiera ido a México si hubiera tenido tiempo.

I WOULD HAVE________IF I HAD________

HUBIERA________SI HUBIERA________

The order of this construction may be reversed.

IF I HAD________I WOULD HAVE________

SI HUBIERA________HUBIERA________

EXAMPLES:

* If I had studied, I would have known the lesson.Si hubiera estudiado, hubiera sabido la lección.

* If I had studied, I would have spoken Spanish.Si hubiera estudiado, hubiera hablado español.

* If I had had time, I would have gone to Mexico.Si hubiera tenido tiempo, hubiera ido a México.

## USES OF DEBER, OUGHT, SHOULD, MUST

“Deber” is a regular verb

“Deber” is an auxiliary verb that must be followed by an infinitive.

Debo estudiar. I ought to study.

Pablo debe estar en Cuba. Paul must be in Cuba.

Debemos ir al concierto. We should go to the concert.

Deben pagar la cuenta. They should pay the bill.

Debe ser muy difícil. It must be very difficult.

No debe ser fácil. It must not be easy.

Debe haber ido al despacho. He must have gone to the office.

Debe haber estudiado. He must have studied.

## PASSIVE VOICE

The passive voice is used much more in English than it is in Spanish.

In English you say, “I was invited to a party,” and you don’t say who invited you. In Spanish we prefer an active subject, so we use the figurative “they” and say, “They invited me to a party.” “Me invitaron a una fiesta.” This still doesn’t say who invited you, but the implication that “they” invited you gives the sentence a much needed subject.

EXAMPLES:

The ships were painted. Pintaron los barcos. (“They” painted the ships.)

The rooms were cleaned. Limpiaron los cuartos. (“They” cleaned the rooms.)

The clothes were washed. Lavaron la ropa. (“They” washed the clothes.)

The house was bought. Compraron la casa. (“They” bought the house.)

## NEGATIVES AND DOUBLE NEGATIVES

nada, nothing
ninguno, no one

nadie, nobody
jamás, never

The word “no” when it appears before a noun:

MASCULINE
FEMININE

ningún
ninguna

ningunos
ningunas

EXAMPLES:

ningún hombre, no man
ninguna mujer, no woman

ningunos hombres, no men
ningunas mujeres, no women

In Spanish the double negative is the correct grammatical construction for sentences beginning with the word “no.”

EXAMPLES:

No ví nada. I didn’t see anything (I didn’t see nothing).

No oí nada. I didn’t hear anything (I didn’t hear nothing).

No ví a nadie. I didn’t see anyone (I didn’t see no one).

No hablé con ninguno. I didn’t talk to anyone (I didn’t talk to no one).

No hice nada. I didn’t do anything (I didn’t do nothing).

## THE INTIMATE FORM OF ADDRESS

n Spanish there is an intimate form of address that is used with members of your family and close friends. In this case the pronoun “usted” (you) becomes “tú” (thou) and the verbs change their endings.

In order to change verbs into the intimate form ADD THE LETTER “S” TO THE SINGULAR THIRD MAN IN ALL TENSES (except the preterite and the command).

 
FORMAL
INTIMATE

PRESENT
usted habla
tú hablas, you speak

IMPERFECT
usted hablaba
tú hablabas, you used to speak

FUTURE TENSE
usted hablará
tú hablarás, you will speak

CONDITIONAL
usted hablaría
tú hablarías, you would speak

PRES. SUBJUNCTIVE
hable
hables

PAST SUBJUNCTIVE
hablara
hablaras

In compound tenses add the letter “s” to the auxiliary verb

 
FORMAL
INTIMATE

PRES. PERFECT
usted ha hablado, you have spoken
tú has hablado, you have spoken

PAST PERFECT
usted había hablado, you had spoken
tú habías hablado, you had spoken

PRES. PROGRESSIVE
usted está hablando, you are speaking
tú estás hablando, you are speaking

PAST PROGRESSIVE
usted estaba hablando, you were speaking
tú estabas hablando, you were speaking

FUTURE
usted va a hablar, you are going to speak
tú vas a hablar, you are going to speak

ER and IR verbs

 
FORMAL
INTIMATE

PRESENT
usted vende
tú vendes, you sell

IMPERFECT
usted vendía
tú vendías, you used to sell

FUTURE TENSE
usted venderá
tú venderás, you will sell

CONDITIONAL
usted vendería
tú venderías, you would sell

PRES. SUBJUNCTIVE
venda
vendas

PAST SUBJUNCTIVE
vendiera
vendieras

To form the intimate preterite of “ar” verbs remove “ar” from the infinitive and add “aste.”

EXAMPLES:

tú hablaste, (intimate) you talked

tú compraste, (intimate) you bought

To form the intimate preterite of “er” and “ir” verbs remove the “er” or “ir” and add “iste.”

EXAMPLES:

tú vendiste, (intimate) you sold

tú escribiste, (intimate) you wrote

To form the intimate command of “ar” verbs remove “ar” and add the letter “a.”

habla, speak
compra, buy

To form the intimate command of “er” and “ir” verbs remove the “er” or the “ir” and add “e.”

vende, sell
escribe, write

Remember that subject pronouns are very frequently dropped in Spanish. “Tú” is dropped more often than not because the ending of the verb makes it clear who the subject is.

You can either say, “Tú hablas muy bien” (You speak very well) or simply “Hablas muy bien.”

The intimate form has an archaic English equivalent (thou, thee, thine), but it has not been used here since it is not used in present-day speech.

The actual translation of “Tú hablas” is “Thou speakest.”

Only one nonconformist verb is irregular in the present tense intimate form: “usted es” becomes “tú eres.” All the rest of the nonconformist verbs follow the regular rule in the present: Add the letter “s” to the singular, third man form.

EXAMPLES:

tú haces, you do; tú vienes, you come; tú tienes, you have

To form the intimate preterite of nonconformist verbs remove the letter “o” from the singular third man form of the preterite and add “iste.”

EXAMPLES:

FORMAL
INTIMATE

usted tuvo, you had
tú tuviste, you had

usted estuvo, you were
tú estuviste, you were

usted vino, you came
tú viniste, you came

usted puso, you put
tú pusiste, you put

In “fué,” you remove the “é” and add “iste”:

usted fué, you went; tú fuiste, you went

In “cayó,” “oyó,” “leyó” and all other verbs that end in “yo” remove the “yo” and add “iste” (accent the í).

EXAMPLES:

FORMAL
INTIMATE

usted cayó, you fell
tú caíste, you fell

usted leyó, you read
tú leíste, you read

usted oyó, you heard
tú oíste, you heard

To form the intimate command of nonconformist verbs drop the “ga” from the formal command.

FORMAL COMMAND
INTIMATE COMMAND

venga, come
ven, come

salga, go out
sal, go out

diga, say
di, say

ponga, put
pon, put

tenga, have (take)
ten, have (take)

traiga, bring
trae, bring

caiga, fall
cae, fall

The “i” changes to “e” in the intimate form of the verbs “trae” and “cae.”

To form the negative of the intimate command add “s” to the formal command.

FORMAL COMMAND
INTIMATE NEGATIVE COMMAND

venga, come
no vengas, don’t come

salga, go out
no salgas, don’t go out

diga, say
no digas, don’t say

ponga, put
no pongas, don’t put

tenga, have (take)
no tengas, don’t have

traiga, bring
no traigas, don’t bring

caiga, fall
no caigas, don’t fall

Four verbs do not follow the rule:

FORMAL COMMAND
INTIMATE COMMAND
INTIMATE NEGATIVE COMMAND

oiga, hear, listen
oye, hear, listen
no oigas, don’t hear

haga, do, make
haz, do, make
no hagas, don’t do

vaya, go
vé, go
no vayas, don’t go

sea, be
sé, be
no seas, don’t be

“Con usted” (with you) has an intimate form: “contigo” (with thee).

The intimate equivalent for LO, LA, LE is TE.

FORMAL
INTIMATE

lo ví, I saw you (masc.)
te ví, I saw you (thee)

le dí, I gave you
te dí, I gave you (thee)

la invité, I invited you (fem.)
te invité, I invited you

## STRESSES AND ACCENTS

RULE I: When a word ends in N, S, or a vowel it receives the stress on the next to the last syllable.

EXAMPLES:

entran, EN–tran (stress the e)

sombreros, som–BRE–ros (stress the e)

dentista, den–TIS–ta (stress the i)

posible, po–SI–ble (stress the i)

loco, LO–co (stress the first o)

RULE II: When a word does not end in N, S, or a vowel it receives the accent on the last syllable.

EXAMPLES:

tractor, trac–TOR (stress the o)

postal, pos–TAL (stress the a)

Any word that does not follow either Rule I or Rule II is an abnormal word and therefore must have a written accent.

EXAMPLES:

público, pú–bli–co

dramático, dra–má–ti–co

árbol, ár–bol

azúcar, a–zú–car

conversación, con–ver–sa–ción

café, ca–fé

The letters A, E, O form syllables whether used alone or in combination with any other letter.

EXAMPLES:

lc–o

cre–e

The letters I and U form syllables when they are not combined with any vowel.

EXAMPLES:

popular, po–pu–lar

capital, ca–pi–tal

When I and U are combined with another vowel they do not form separate syllables.

EXAMPLES:

ciudad, ciu–dad

oigo, oi–go

familia, fa–mi–lia

traigo, trai–go

If you are a beginner, do not read the following rules until you have mastered lesson 40.

Accents are used to distinguish two identical words that have different meanings.

EXAMPLES:

de, of, from
dé, give

el, the
él, he

mi, my
mí, me

si, if
sí, yes

Some words require accents when they are used in exclamations or in questions.
