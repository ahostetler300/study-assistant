IN OLDEN TIMES,
when  men still worshiped ugly idols, there  lived in the
land  of  Greece  a  folk  of  shepherds  and  herdsmen  who
cherished  light  and  beauty.  They  did  not  worship  dark
idols like their neighbors, but created instead their own
beautiful, radiant gods.

The  Greek  gods  looked  much  like  people  and  acted
like  them,  too,  only  they  were  taller,  handsomer  and
could do no wrong. Fire-breathing monsters and beasts
with many heads stood for all that was dark and wicked.
They were for gods and great heroes to conquer.

The  gods  lived  on  top  of  Olympus,  a  mountain  so
high and steep that no man could climb it and see them
in  their  shining  palace.  But  they  often  descended  to
earth,  sometimes  in  their  own  shapes,  sometimes
disguised as humans or animals.

Mortals  worshiped  the  gods  and  the  gods  honored
Mother  Earth.  They  had  all  sprung  from  her,  for  she
was the beginning of all life.

GAEA, the Earth, came out of darkness so long ago that nobody

knows when or how. Earth was young and lonesome, for nothing
lived  on  her  yet.  Above  her  rose  Uranus,  the  Sky,  dark  and  blue,
set  all  over  with  sparkling  stars.  He  was  magnificent  to  behold,
and  young  Earth  looked  up  at  him  and  fell  in  love  with  him.  Sky
smiled down at Earth, twinkling with his countless stars, and they
were joined in love. Soon young Earth became Mother Earth, the
mother of all things living. All her children loved their warm and
bountiful  mother  and  feared  their  mighty  father,  Uranus,  lord  of
the universe.

THE TITANS
THE  TITANS  were the first children  of Mother  Earth. They were

the first gods, taller than the mountains she created to serve them
as  thrones,  and  both  Earth  and  Sky  were  proud  of  them.  There
were  six  Titans,  six  glorious  gods,  and  they  had  six  sisters,  the
Titanesses, whom they took for their wives.

When Gaea again gave birth, Uranus was not proud. Their new
children were also huge, but each had only one glowing eye set in
the middle of his forehead. They were the three Cyclopes and they
were named Lightning, Thunder, and Thunderbolt. They were not
handsome  gods,  but  tremendously  strong  smiths.  Sparks  from
their heavy hammers flashed across the sky and lit up the heavens
so brightly that even their father’s stars faded.

After  a  while  Mother  Earth  bore  three  more  sons.  Uranus
looked  at  them  with  disgust.  Each  of  them  had  fifty  heads  and  a
hundred  strong  arms.  He  hated  to  see  such  ugly  creatures  walk
about  on  lovely  Earth,  so  he  seized  them  and  their  brothers  the
Cyclopes  and  flung  them  into  Tartarus,  the  deepest,  darkest  pit
under the earth.

Mother  Earth  loved  her  children  and  could  not  forgive  her
husband for his cruelty to them. Out of hardest flint she fashioned
a sickle and spoke to her sons the Titans:

“Take this weapon, make an end to your father’s cruelty and set

your brothers free.”

Fear  took  hold  of  five  of  the  Titans  and  they  trembled  and
refused.  Only  Cronus,  the  youngest  but  the  strongest,  dared  to
take  the  sickle.  He  fell  upon  his  father.  Uranus  could  not
withstand  the  weapon  wielded  by  his  strong  son  and  he  fled,
giving up his powers.

Mother  Earth  made  Pontus,  the  boundless  seas,  her  second
husband,  and  from  this  union  sprang  the  gods  of  the  watery
depths. And from her rich ground grew an abundance of trees and
flowers  and,  out  of  her  crevices,  sprites,  beasts,  and  early  man
crept forth.

CRONUS was now the lord of the universe. He sat on the highest

mountain and ruled over heaven and earth with a firm hand. The
other gods obeyed his will and early man worshiped him. This was
man’s Golden Age. Men lived happily and in peace with the gods
and  each  other.  They  did  not  kill  and  they  had  no  locks  on  their
doors, for theft had not yet been invented.

But Cronus did not set his monstrous brothers free, and Mother
Earth  was  angry  with  him  and  plotted  his  downfall.  She  had  to
wait,  for  no  god  yet  born  was  strong  enough  to  oppose  him.  But
she  knew  that  one  of  his  sons  would  be  stronger  than  he,  just  as
Cronus had been stronger than his father. Cronus knew it too, so
every time his Titaness-wife Rhea gave birth, he took the newborn
god and swallowed it. With all of his offspring securely inside him,
he had nothing to fear.

But  Rhea  mourned.  Her  five  sisters,  who  had  married  the  five
other  Titans,  were  surrounded  by  their  Titan  children,  while  she
was  all  alone.  When  Rhea  expected  her  sixth  child,  she  asked
Mother Earth to help her save the child from his father. That was
just  what  Mother  Earth  had  been  waiting  for.  She  gave  her
daughter whispered advice, and Rhea went away smiling.

As soon as Rhea had borne her child, the god Zeus, she hid him.
Then  she  wrapped  a  stone  in  baby  clothes  and  gave  it  to  her
husband  to  swallow  instead  of  her  son.  Cronus  was  fooled  and

swallowed the stone, and the little god Zeus was spirited away to a
secret  cave  on  the  island  of  Crete.  Old  Cronus  never  heard  the
cries  of  his  young  son,  for  Mother  Earth  set  noisy  earth  sprites
outside  the  cave.  They  made  such  a  clatter,  beating  their  shields
with their swords, that other sounds were drowned out.

ZEUS
AND HIS FAMILY
ZEUS was tended by gentle nymphs and was nursed by the fairy

goat Amaltheia. From the horns of the goat flowed ambrosia and
nectar,  the  food  and  drink  of  the  gods.  Zeus  grew  rapidly,  and  it
was not long before he strode out of the cave as a great new god.
To  thank  the  nymphs  for  tending  him  so  well,  he  gave  them  the
horns  of  the  goat.  They  were  horns  of  plenty  and  could  never  be
emptied.  From  the  hide  of  the  goat  he  made  for  himself  an
impenetrable  breastplate,  the  Aegis,  and  now  he  was  so  strong
that Cronus could do nothing against him.

Young  Zeus  chose  Metis,  a  Titan’s  daughter,  for  his  first  wife.
She was the goddess of prudence, and he needed her good advice.
She warned him not to try alone to overthrow his child-devouring
father,  for  Cronus  had  all  the  other  Titans  and  their  sons  on  his
side. First Zeus must also have strong allies.

Metis  went  to  Cronus  and  cunningly  tricked  him  into  eating  a
magic  herb.  He  thought  that  the  herb  would  make  him
unconquerable.  Instead  it  made  him  so  sick  that  he  vomited  up

not only the stone he had swallowed, but his five other children as
well.  They  were  the  gods  Hades  and  Poseidon  and  the  goddesses
Hestia, Demeter, and Hera, all mighty gods who right away joined
forces  with  Zeus.  When  Cronus  saw  the  six  young  gods  rising
against him, he knew that his hour had come and he surrendered
his powers and fled.

Now Zeus was the lord of the universe. He did not want to rule
alone. He shared his powers with his brothers and sisters. But the
Titans  and  their  sons  revolted.  They  refused  to  let  themselves  be
ruled  by  the  new  gods.  Only  Prometheus  and  his  brother
Epimetheus left the Titans to join Zeus, for Prometheus could look
into the future and he knew that Zeus would win.

Zeus freed the monstrous sons of Mother Earth from Tartarus.
Gratefully  the  hundred-armed  ones  fought  for  him  with  all  their
strength, and the Cyclopes forged mighty weapons for him and his
brothers.

They made a trident for Poseidon. It was so forceful that when
he struck the ground with it, the earth shook, and when he struck
the sea, frothing waves stood mountain high.

For Hades they made a cap of invisibility so he could strike his
enemies unseen, and  for Zeus they forged lightning  bolts.  Armed
with  them,  he  was  the  mightiest  god  of  them  all,  nothing  could
stand against him and his thunderbolts. The Titans fought a bitter
battle, but at last they had to surrender, and Zeus locked them up
in Tartarus. The hundred-armed monsters went to stand guard at
the gates to see that they never escaped. Atlas, the strongest of the
Titans, was sent to the end of the world to carry forever the vault
of the sky on his shoulders.

Angry  with  Zeus  for  sending  her  sons  the  Titans  into  the  dark
pit  of  Tartarus,  Mother  Earth  now  brought  forth  two  terrible
monsters,  Typhon  and  his  mate,  Echidna,  and  sent  them  against
Zeus.  They  were  so  fearful  that  when  the  gods  saw  them  they

changed  themselves  into  animals  and  fled  in  terror.  Typhon’s
hundred horrible heads touched the stars, venom dripped from his
evil  eyes,  and  lava  and  red-hot  stones  poured  from  his  gaping
mouths. Hissing like a hundred snakes and roaring like a hundred
lions, he tore up whole mountains and threw them at the gods.

Zeus soon regained his courage and turned, and when the other
gods  saw  him  taking  his  stand,  they  came  back  to  help  him  fight
the  monster.  A  terrible  battle  raged,  and  hardly  a  living  creature
was left on earth. But Zeus was fated to win, and as Typhon tore
up  huge  Mount  Aetna  to  hurl  at  the  gods,  Zeus  struck  it  with  a
hundred  well-aimed  thunderbolts  and  the  mountain  fell  back,
pinning  Typhon  underneath.  There  the  monster  lies  to  this  very
day,  belching  fire,  lava,  and  smoke  through  the  top  of  the
mountain.

Echidna, his hideous mate, escaped destruction. She cowered in
a cave, protecting Typhon’s dreadful offspring, and Zeus let them
live as a challenge to future heroes.

Now  at  last  Mother  Earth  gave  up  her  struggle.  There  were  no
more  upheavals,  and  the  wounds  of  the  war  soon  healed.  The
mountains stood firmly anchored. The seas had their shores. The
rivers  had  their  riverbeds  and  oxhorned  river-gods  watched  over
them,  and  each  tree  and  each  spring  had  its  nymph.  The  earth
again was green and fruitful and Zeus could begin to rule in peace.

The one-eyed Cyclopes were not only smiths but masons as well,
and  they  built  a  towering  palace  for  the  gods  on  top  of  Mount
Olympus, the highest mountain in Greece. The palace was hidden
in  clouds,  and  the  goddesses  of  the  seasons  rolled  them  away
whenever  a  god  wanted  to  go  down  to  earth.  Nobody  else  could
pass through the gate of clouds.

Iris,  the  fleet-footed  messenger  of  the  gods,  had  her  own  path
down  to  earth.  Dressed  in  a  gown  of  iridescent  drops,  she  ran
along  the  rainbow  on  her  busy  errands  between  Olympus  and
earth.

In the gleaming hall of the palace, where light never failed, the
Olympian  gods  sat  on  twelve  golden  thrones  and  reigned  over
heaven  and  earth.  There  were  twelve  great  gods,  for  Zeus  shared
his powers, not only with his brothers and sisters, but with six of
his children and the goddess of love as well.

Zeus  himself  sat  on  the  highest  throne,  with  a  bucketful  of
thunderbolts  beside  him.  On  his  right  sat  his  youngest  sister,
Hera, whom he had chosen from all his wives as his queen. Beside
her sat her son, Ares, god of war, and Hephaestus, god of fire, with
Aphrodite,  goddess  of  love,  between  them.  Next  was  Zeus’s  son
Hermes,  the  herald  of  the  gods,  and  Zeus’s  sister  Demeter,
goddess of the harvest with her daughter, Persephone, on her lap.
On  the  left  of  Zeus  sat  his  brother  Poseidon,  the  lord  of  the  sea.
Next to him sat the four children of Zeus: Athena, the twins Apollo
and Artemis, and Dionysus, the youngest of the gods. Athena was
the  goddess  of  wisdom,  Apollo,  the  god  of  light  and  music,
Artemis, goddess of the hunt, and Dionysus, the god of wine.

Hestia, the eldest sister of Zeus, was goddess of the hearth. She
had  no  throne,  but  tended  the  sacred  fire  in  the  hall,  and  every
hearth  on  earth  was  her  altar.  She  was  the  gentlest  of  all  the
Olympians.

Hades, the eldest brother of Zeus, was the lord of the dead. He
preferred to stay in his gloomy palace in the underworld and never

went to Olympus.

The  gods  themselves  could  not  die,  for  divine  ichor  flowed  in
their  veins  instead  of  blood.  Most  of  the  time  they  lived  happily
together,  feasting  on  sweet-smelling  ambrosia  and  nectar,  but
when  their  wills  clashed,  there  were  violent  quarrels.  Then  Zeus
would  reach  for  a  thunderbolt  and  the  Olympians  would  tremble
and  fall  to  order,  for  Zeus  alone  was  stronger  than  all  the  other
gods together.

HERA, the beautiful queen of Olympus, was a very jealous wife.

Even  Zeus,  who  was  afraid  of  nothing,  feared  her  fits  of  temper.
She hated all his other wives, and when Zeus first asked her to be
his wife, she refused. Slyly Zeus created a thunderstorm, changed
himself  into  a  little  cuckoo,  and,  pretending  to  be  in  distress,  he
flew into Hera’s arms for protection. She pitied the wet little bird
and hugged it close to keep it warm, but all of a sudden she found
herself holding mighty Zeus in her arms instead of the bird.

Thus  Zeus  won  Hera  and  all  nature  burst  into  bloom  for  their
wedding. Mother Earth gave the bride a little apple tree that bore
golden apples of immortality. Hera treasured the tree and planted
it  in  the  garden  of  the  Hesperides,  her  secret  garden  far  to  the
west.  She  put  a  hundred-headed  dragon  under  the  tree  to  guard
the  apples  and  ordered  the  three  Nymphs  of  the  Hesperides  to
water and care for the tree.

Zeus  loved  Hera  dearly,  but  he  was  also  very  fond  of  rocky
Greece.  He  often  sneaked  down  to  earth  in  disguise  to  marry
mortal girls. The more wives he had, the more children he would
have, and all the better for Greece! All his children would inherit
some  of  his  greatness  and  become  great  heroes  and  rulers.  But
Hera in  her jealous rage  tormented his other  wives and children,
and  even  Zeus  was  powerless  to  stop  her.  She  knew  how  tricky
Zeus could be and kept very close watch over him.

One day as Hera looked down on earth, she spied a small dark
thundercloud where no cloud should have been. She rushed down
and  darted  into  the  cloud.  Zeus  was  there  just  as  she  had
suspected, but with him was only a little snow-white cow. He had
seen  Hera  coming  and,  to  protect  his  newest  bride  Io  from  her
wrath,  he  had  changed  the  girl  into  a  cow.  Alas!  The  cow  was  as
lovely as the girl, and Hera was not deceived, but she pretended to

suspect  nothing  and  begged  Zeus  to  let  her  have  the  dainty  cow.
Zeus  could  not  well  refuse  his  queen  such  a  little  wish  without
giving  himself  away,  and  he  had  to  give  her  the  cow.  Hera  tied
poor  Io  to  a  tree  and  sent  her  servant  Argus  to  keep  watch  over
her.

Argus  had  a  hundred  bright  eyes  placed  all  over  his  body.  He
was so big and strong that singlehandedly he had made an end to
the monstrous Echidna, who had lived in a cave and had devoured
all who passed by. He was Hera’s faithful servant and the best of
watchmen, for he never closed more than half of his eyes in sleep
at a time.

Argus  sat  down  next  to  the  cow  and  watched  her  with  all  his
eyes, and poor Io had to walk on four legs and eat grass. She raised
her mournful eyes to Olympus, but Zeus was so afraid of Hera that
he did not dare to help her. At last he could no longer bear to see
her  distress,  and  he  asked  his  son  Hermes,  the  craftiest  of  the
gods, to run down to earth and set Io free.

Hermes disguised himself as a shepherd and walked up to Argus
playing  a  tune  on  his  shepherd’s  pipe.  Argus  was  bored,  having
nothing to do with all his eyes but watch a little cow, and he was
glad  to  have  music  and  company.  Hermes  sat  down  beside  him,
and after he had played for a while, he began to tell a long and dull
story.  It  had  no  beginning  and  it  had  no  end  and  fifty  of  Argus’s
eyes closed in sleep. Hermes droned on and on and slowly the fifty
other  eyes  fell  shut,  one  by  one.  Quickly  Hermes  touched  all  the
eyes with his magic wand and closed them forever in eternal sleep.
Argus had been bored to death.

Hermes then untied the cow, and Io ran home to her father, the
river-god  Inachos.  He  did  not  recognize  the  cow  as  his  daughter,
and  Io  could  not  tell  him  what  had  happened,  all  she  could  say
was, “Mooo!” But when she lifted up her little hoof and scratched
her name, “I-O,” in the river sand, her father at once understood
what  had  happened,  for  he  knew  the  ways  of  Zeus.  Inachos  rose
out of his river bed and rushed off to take revenge on the mighty
thunder-god.  He  flew  at  Zeus  in  such  a  rage  that  to  save himself
Zeus  had  to  throw  a  thunderbolt,  and  ever  since  the  bed  of  the
river Inachos in Arcadia has been dry.

Hera  was  furious  when  she  saw  that  Argus  was  dead  and  the
cow  Io  had  been  set  free.  She  sent  a  vicious  gadfly  to  sting  and
chase  the  cow.  To  be  sure  that  her  faithful  servant  Argus  would
never be forgotten, she took his hundred bright eyes and put them
on  the  tail  of  the  peacock,  her  favorite  bird.  The  eyes  could  no
longer  see,  but  they  looked  gorgeous,  and  that  went  to  the
peacock’s little head, and made it the vainest of all animals.

Pursued  by  the  gadfly,  Io  ran  all  over  Greece.  Trying  to  escape
from  its  tormenting  sting,  she  jumped  across  the  strait  that
separates  Europe  from  Asia  Minor,  and,  ever  since,  it  has  been
called the Bosporus, the “cow ford.”

But still the gadfly chased her all the way to the land of Egypt.
When  the  Egyptians  saw  the  snow-white  cow,  they  fell  to  their
knees  and  worshiped  her.  She  became  an  Egyptian  goddess,  and
Hera now permitted Zeus to change her back to her human shape.
But first he had to promise never to look at Io again.

Io  lived  long  as  the  goddess-queen  of  Egypt,  and  the  son  she
bore to Zeus became king after her. Her descendants returned to
Greece  as  great  kings  and  beautiful  queens.  Poor  Io’s  sufferings
had not all been in vain.

HEPHAESTUS,  the  god  of  smiths  and  fire,  was  the  son  of  Zeus

and Hera. He was a hard-working, peace-loving god and was very
fond of his mother. Often he tried to soothe her temper with gentle
words.  Once  he  had  even  dared  to  step  between  his  quarreling
parents. He sided with Hera, and that made Zeus so angry that he
seized  his  son  by  the  legs  and  flung  him  out  of  Olympus.  For  a
whole day, Hephaestus hurtled through the air. In the evening he
fell on the island of Lemnos, with a thump so hard that the island
shook.  Thetis,  a  gentle  sea  goddess,  found  him  all  broken  and
bruised. She bound his wounds and nursed him back to health.

Zeus  forgave  him  and  Hephaestus  returned  to  Olympus,  but
ever after, he walked like a flickering flame. His body was big and
strong  and  his  hands  were  wonderfully  skilled,  but  his  weak  legs
could not support him for long. He built for himself two robots of
gold and silver to help him about. They had mechanical brains and
could  think  for  themselves.  They  even  could  speak  with  their
tongues of silver. They also served him as helpers in his workshop
on Olympus. It was there that Hephaestus made the twelve golden
thrones  of  the  gods  and  their  marvelous  weapons,  chariots,  and
jewels.

He also had forges inside volcanoes on earth. His helpers there
were the one-eyed Cyclopes. They worked his bellows and swung
his heavy hammers. When Hephaestus was at work, the din of the

hammers could be heard for miles and sparks flew out of the tops
of the mountains.

All the Olympian gods were fond of Hephaestus and often went
to his forge to admire his work. When Aphrodite, his lovely wife,
came  to  his  workshop  to  look  at  the  matchless  jewels  he  was
fashioning  for  her,  she  daintly  lifted  her  trailing  garments  out  of
the soot.

APHRODITE,  the  beautiful  goddess  of  love,  was  the  only

Olympian who had neither mother nor father. Nobody knew from
where  she  had  come.  The  West  Wind  had  first  seen  her  in  the
pearly  light  of  dawn  as  she  rose  out  of  the  sea  on  a  cushion  of
foam. She floated lightly over the gentle waves and was so lovely to
behold  that  the  wind  almost  lost  his  breath.  With  soft  puffs,  he
blew her to the flowering island of Cythera, where the three Graces
welcomed  her  ashore.  The  three  Graces,  goddesses  of  beauty,
became  her  attendants.  They  dressed  her
in  shimmering
garments, bedecked her with sparkling jewels, and placed her in a
golden  chariot  drawn  by  white  doves.  Then  they  led  her  to
Olympus, where all the gods rejoiced in her beauty, seated her on
a golden throne, and made her one of them.

Zeus  was  afraid  that  the  gods  would  fight  over  the  hand  of
Aphrodite, and, to prevent it, he quickly chose a husband for her.
He gave her to Hephaestus, the steadiest of the gods, and he, who
could hardly believe in his good luck, used all his skill to make the
most lavish jewels for her. He made her a girdle of finely wrought
gold and wove magic into the filigree work. That was not very wise
of him, for when she wore her magic girdle no one could resist her,
and she was all too irresistible already.

Aphrodite  had  a  mischievous  little  son  whose  name  was  Eros.
He darted about with a bow and a quiver full of arrows. They were
arrows of love and he delighted in shooting them into the hearts of

unwary  victims.  Whoever  was  hit  by  one  of  his  arrows  fell  head
over heels in love with the first person he saw, while Eros laughed
mockingly.

Once  a  year  Aphrodite  returned  to  Cythera  and  dived  into  the
sea from which she had come. Sparkling and young, she rose from
the  water,  as  dewy  fresh  as  on  the  day  when  she  had  first  been
seen.  She  loved  gaiety  and  glamour  and  was  not  at  all  pleased  at
being  the  wife  of  sooty,  hard-working  Hephaestus.  She  would
rather have had his brother Ares for her husband.

ARES, god of war, was tall and handsome but vain, and as cruel

as his brother Hephaestus was kind. Eris, the spirit of strife, was
his  constant  companion.  Eris  was  sinister  and  mean,  and  her
greatest joy was to make trouble. She had a golden apple that was
so bright and shiny everybody wanted to have it. When she threw
it among friends, their friendship came to a rapid end. When she
threw  it  among  enemies,  war  broke  out,  for  the  golden  apple  of
Eris was an apple of discord.

When Ares heard the clashing of arms, he grinned with glee, put
on  his  gleaming  helmet,  and
into  his  war  chariot.
Brandishing  his  sword  like  a  torch,  he  rushed  into  the  thick  of
battle, not caring who won or lost as long as much blood was shed.
A  vicious  crowd  followed  at  his  heels,  carrying  with  them  Pain,
Panic, Famine, and Oblivion.

leapt

Once  in  a  while,  Ares  himself  was  wounded.  He  was  immortal
but  he  could  not  bear  to  suffer  pain  and  screamed  so  loudly  that
he could be heard for miles. Then he would run home to Olympus,
where Zeus in disgust called him the worst of his children and told

him to stop his howling. His wounds, treated with the ointment of
the  gods,  quickly  healed,  and  Ares  returned  as  good  as  ever  and
seated  himself  on  his  throne,  tall,  handsome,  and  boastful,  the
plume on his golden helmet nodding proudly.

Aphrodite  admired  him  for  his  splendid  looks,  but  none  of  the
other gods were fond of him, least of all his half sister Athena. She
loathed his vain strutting and senseless bloodshed.

ATHENA, the goddess of wisdom, was the favorite child of Zeus.

She had sprung fully grown out of her father’s head.

Her  mother  was  Metis,  goddess  of  prudence,  the  first  wife  of
Zeus.  He  depended  on  her,  for  he  needed  her  wise  council,  but
Mother Earth warned him that, were Metis to bear him a son, this
son would dethrone him as Zeus had dethroned Cronus, his father
who had dethroned his own father, Uranus. This must not happen,
thought  Zeus,  but  he  could  not  do  without  her  advice,  so  he
decided to swallow her. Slyly, he proposed that they play a game of
changing  shapes,  and  Metis,  forgetting  her  prudence,  playfully
turned herself into all kinds of animals, big and small. Just as she
had taken on the shape of a little fly, Zeus opened wide his mouth,
took a deep breath, and zip! he swallowed the fly. Ever after, Metis
sat in his head and guided him from there.

Now it happened that Metis was going to have a daughter, and
she sat inside Zeus’s head hammering out a helmet and weaving a
splendid  robe  for  the  coming  child.  Soon  Zeus  began  to  suffer
from  pounding  headaches  and  cried  out  in  agony.  All  the  gods
came  running  to  help  him,  and  skilled  Hephaestus  grasped  his
tools and split open his father’s skull. Out sprang Athena, wearing
the  robe  and  the  helmet,  her  gray  eyes  flashing.  Thunder  roared
and the gods stood in awe.

Athena’s  constant  companion  was  Nike,  the  spirit  of  victory.
With  Nike  at  her  side,  Athena  led  armies,  but  only  those  that
fought for just causes. In time of peace she stood behind the artists
of Greece and taught them the fine and useful arts. She had great
pride in her own skills at the loom and the potter’s wheel, but was
happy  to  see  her  pupils  excel  as  long  as  they  showed  her  proper
respect.

One of her pupils was Arachne, a simple country girl, who was
wonderfully skilled at the loom. People came from far and wide to
admire  her  weavings.  Stupidly  she  boasted  that  she  had  learned
nothing  from  Athena;  indeed,  that  she  was  better  than  the
goddess!

That hurt Athena’s pride. Disguised as an old woman, she went

to the girl and tried to talk sense into her.

“Your  work  is  beautiful,”  she  said,  “but  why  compare  yourself
with  the  gods?  Why  not  be  contented  to  be  the  best  among
mortals?”

“Let  the  goddess  Athena  herself  come  and  measure  her  skill

against mine,” Arachne answered haughtily.

Angrily Athena threw off her disguise and stood before the girl

in all her glory.

“Vain girl,” she said, “you may have your wish. Sit down at your

loom and let us compete.”

Athena wove the most beautiful tapestry ever seen, every thread
and  knot  was  perfect  and  the  colors  sparkled.  It  pictured  the
Olympian gods in all their glory and majesty.

Arachne’s  tapestry  was  also  beautifully  woven;  Athena  herself
had  to  admit  that  the  girl’s  craftmanship  was  flawless.  But  what
kind of a picture had she woven? An irreverent scene making fun
of Zeus and his wives!

In a wrath the goddess tore the tapestry to shreds and struck the
girl  with  the  shuttle.  Immediately  Arachne  felt  her  head  shrink
almost  to  nothing,  her  nimble  fingers  change  into  long,  spindly
legs. Athena had turned her into a spider.

“Vainglorious  girl,  go  on  and  spin  your  thread  and  weave  your
empty  net  forever,”  said  Athena  to  Arachne,  the  spider.  Athena
was a just goddess and she could be very stern. She knew that the
gods  were  great  only  as  long  as  they  were  properly  worshiped  by
mortals.

Athena was very fond of a certain city in Greece, and so was her
uncle,  Poseidon.  Both  of  them  claimed  the  city,  and  after  a  long

quarrel they decided that the one who could give it the finest gift
should have it.

Leading  a  procession  of  citizens,  the  two  gods  mounted  the
Acropolis,  the  flat-topped  rock  that  crowned  the  city.  Poseidon
struck the cliff with his trident, and a spring welled up. The people
marveled, but the water was salty as the sea that Poseidon ruled,
and  not  very  useful.  Then  Athena  gave  the  city  her  gift.  She
planted an olive tree in a crevice on the rock. It was the first olive
tree the people had ever seen. Athena’s gift was judged the better
of  the  two,  for  it  gave  food,  oil,  and  wood,  and  the  city  was  hers.
From  her  beautiful  temple  on  top  of  the  Acropolis,  Athena
watched over Athens, her city, with the wise owl, her bird, on her
shoulder, and under her leadership the Athenians grew famous for
their arts and crafts.

POSEIDON,  lord  of  the  sea,  was  a  moody  and  violent  god.  His

fierce  blue  eyes  pierced  the  haze,  and  his  sea-blue  hair  streamed
out  behind  him.  He  was  called  the  Earthshaker,  for  when  he
struck  the  ground  with  his  trident,  the  earth  trembled  and  split
open. When he struck the sea, waves rose mountain high and the
winds  howled,  wrecking  ships  and  drowning  those  who  lived  on
the shores. But when he was in a calm mood, he would stretch out
his hand and still the sea and raise new lands out of the water.

In  the  days  of  Cronus  and  the  Titans,  the  sea  was  ruled  by
Nereus, son of Mother Earth and Pontus, the seas. Nereus was an
old sea god with a long gray beard and a fishtail and was the father
of  fifty  sea  nymphs,  the  lovely  Nereids.  When  Poseidon,  the
Olympian,  came  to  take  over  the  kingdom  of  the  sea,  kind  old
Nereus  gave  him  his  daughter  Amphitrite  for  his  queen  and
retired to an underwater grotto. He gave the new king and queen
his palace at the bottom of the sea. It was made of the palest gold
and  lay  in  a  garden  of  corals  and  shimmering  pearls.  There
Amphitrite lived contentedly surrounded by her forty-nine Nereid
sisters.  She  had  an  only  son,  whose  name  was  Triton.  He  had  a
fishtail instead of legs, like his grandfather Nereus, and rode about
on the back of a sea monster, trumpeting on a conch shell.

Poseidon was rarely at home. He was a restless god and loved to
race  the  waves  with  his  team  of  snow-white  horses.  It  was  said
that he had created the horse in the shape of breaking waves. Like
his  brother  Zeus,  Poseidon  had  many  wives  and  many  children,
but Amphitrite was not jealous like Hera.

One of the islands that Poseidon raised out of the sea was Delos.
It was so newly created that it was still floating about on the water.
The little island was barren. Nothing grew on it yet except a single
palm  tree.  In  its  shade,  the  two  great  gods  Apollo  and  Artemis
were to be born.

Zeus  had  married  the  goddess  Leto,  and  when  Hera  found  out
that  Leto  was  expecting  twins,  she  flew  into  a  jealous  rage  and
ordered  all  the  lands  in  the  world  to  refuse  Leto  shelter.  Chased
away from every land, poor Leto wandered from place to place and
could not rest to give birth to her twins.

At  last  she  came  to  Delos  and  the  little  island  welcomed  her.
Since  it  was  still  floating  and  not  quite  land,  it  was  free  from
Hera’s  bidding.  Exhausted,  Leto  sank  down  in  the  shade  of  the
palm tree, but still she could not give birth to her twins, for Hera
forbade  Ilithyia,  the  goddess  of  childbirth,  to  go  to  her.  Without
her help no child could be born. All the other goddesses felt sorry
for  Leto  and  tried  to  sway  Hera  by  offering  her  a  beautiful
necklace.  It  was  nine  yards  long,  made  of  gold  and  amber,  and
Hera  could  not  resist  it.  She  let  Ilithyia  go,  and  Iris  whisked  her
down the rainbow to Leto.

Leto’s  first  child  was  Artemis,  a  girl  as  beautiful  as  the  moon,
with  hair  as  dark  as  the  night.  She  was  to  be  the  goddess  of  the

hunt and all newborn creatures. Then Apollo came into the world.
He  was  fair  as  the  sun  and  he  was  to  be  the  god  of  music,  light,
and reason.

Zeus was filled with joy at the sight of his beautiful twins and he
gave  them  each  a  silver  bow  and  a  quiver  full  of  arrows.  The
arrows of Artemis were soft as moonbeams and brought  painless
death,  those  of  Apollo  were  hard  and  piercing  as  the  rays  of  the
sun.

Zeus blessed the little island and fastened it to the bottom of the
sea.  Grass  and  flowers  burst  forth  from  the  barren  ground,  and
Delos became the richest of all the Greek islands. Pilgrims flocked
to  it  and  loaded  it  with  temples  and  treasures  to  honor  Leto  and
her twins.

APOLLO  grew  rapidly,  as  all  gods  did,  and  when  he  was  full

grown, Zeus sent him off in a chariot drawn by white swans to win
for himself the oracle of Delphi.

No place in Greece was as sacred as Delphi, on the steep slopes
of  Mount  Parnassus.  Sulphurous  fumes  rose  from  a  deep  cleft  in
the mountainside. A sibyl, the priestess of Delphi, sat on a tripod
over  the  cleft  and  the  vapors  put  her  into  a  magic  sleep.  In  her
dreams the sibyl heard the voice of Mother Earth coming up from
the depths, and repeated the mystic words she heard. Priests stood
around  the  sibyl  and  explained  the  meanings  of  her  muttered
prophecies to the pilgrims who had come to the oracle of Delphi to
learn about their future.

The  oracle  was  guarded  by  the  darksome  dragon  Python,  who
lay  coiled  around  the  sacred  place.  Old  age  had  made  him  mean
and  so  ill-tempered  that  the  nymphs  fled  from  the  sacred  spring
nearby and the birds no longer dared to sing in the trees.

The  oracle  had  warned  Python  that  Leto’s  son  would  one  day
destroy  him.  He  had  tried  to  devour  Leto  when  she  wandered
about looking for a place to give birth to her children, but she had
escaped.  When  the  old  black  dragon  saw  radiant  Apollo  flying
toward  him in his golden  chariot, he  knew that  his last hour had
come.  But  he  sold  his  life  dearly.  He  unleashed  his  fury,  spitting
fire and venom, and his black scaly body did not stop its writhing

and coiling until Apollo had shot him with a thousand of his silver
shafts.  In  torrents  did  the  dragon’s  venom  flow  down  the
mountainside, and the oracle of Delphi was Apollo’s.

Now  there  was  light  and  joy  on  the  once-somber  slopes  of
Mount Parnassus. The air was filled with sweet tunes as the birds
in  the  sky  and  the  nymphs  of  the  sacred  spring  returned  to  sing
Apollo’s  praise.  The  voice  of  the  young  god  rose  above  all  the
others, for he was also the god of music.

ARTEMIS,  as  a  newborn  goddess,  went  to  her  father,  Zeus,  and

asked  him  to  grant  her  a  wish.  She  wanted  to  remain  forever  a
wild young maiden hunting through the woods, and she asked him
to promise never to make her marry. Zeus consented, and then she
asked him for fifty fleet nymphs as companions and a pack of lop-
eared hounds to hunt with. Her father gave her all she asked, and
she  herself  caught  four  hinds  with  golden  antlers  and  harnessed
them to her silver chariot.

When  the  moon’s  magic  light  shone  over  echoing  hills  and
wooded valleys, Artemis hunted with the nymphs and her hounds.
After a wild hunt, the goddess loved to bathe in a quiet pool. Woe
to the mortal who happened to see her then!

One  night,  quite  by  chance,  a  young  hunter  whose  name  was
Actaeon came upon the pool in the woods where Artemis and her
nymphs were bathing. He should have taken to his heels and run
for  his  life,  but  instead,  he  stood  spellbound  by  the  sight  of  the
goddess.  Artemis  was  furious!  While  the  nymphs  flung  a  tunic
over her shoulders, the goddess dipped her hand into the pool and
threw  a  handful  of  water  at  Actaeon.  The  moment  the  silvery
drops  touched  his  forehead,  antlers  sprouted,  and  rapidly  all  of
Actaeon changed into a stag. His own hounds leaped at him, and,

to his horror, he could not utter a human sound to call them off.
They  brought  him  down,  never  knowing  that  the  deer  was  their
own master.

“No mortal shall live to boast that he has seen Artemis bathing,”
said the goddess, and she picked up her bow and arrows and went
on  hunting  with  her  nymphs.  Artemis  was  a  cold  and  pitiless
goddess.

Apollo  and  Artemis,  though  different  as  day  and  night,  were
very fond of each other and they both adored their mother. No one
could say a belittling word about gentle Leto without arousing the
wrath of her twins.

There  was  a  queen of Thebes whose name was  Niobe. She  was
beautiful  and  she  was  rich  and  she  was  blessed  with  fourteen
children.  Zeus  himself  was  her  grandfather,  and  she  was  very
proud.

“Why worship Leto?” she said to her people. “Build me a temple
and  worship  me  in  her  stead.  I  have  seven  sons  and  seven
daughters, while she has only one of each.”

When  Apollo  and  Artemis  heard  this,  they  grew  very  angry.

Niobe’s disrespect could not go unpunished.

Apollo shot his hard arrows at Niobe’s seven sons. By no fault of
their  own,  they  were  torn  from  life  in  the  prime  of  their  youth.
Then  Artemis  let  fly  her  painless  shafts  at  the  seven  daughters.
Quietly, they lay down on their beds and died.

Niobe’s  proud  heart  was  broken.  She  wept  for  so  long  that  the
gods  at  last  took  pity  on  her  and  changed  her  into  an  unfeeling
rock. Still, inside the rock, a spring welled up and water like tears
trickled down the face of the hard stone.

Apollo  had  many  wives,  but  Zeus  kept  his  promise  to  Artemis
and never made her marry. Only once she promised her hand to a
suitor,  but  that  was  a  promise  she  had  no  intention  of  keeping.
The suitor was Otus, a gigantic son of Poseidon.

Otus and his brother, Ephialtes, were almost sixty feet tall when
they reached manhood,  and still they went on growing.  The gods
watched  them  with  concern,  for  an  oracle  had  predicted  that
neither  gods  nor  mortals  could  kill  the  giant  brothers.  Mother
Earth,  however,  watched  them  with  pleasure.  She  was  still  angry
with  Zeus  for  keeping  her  sons,  the  Titans,  in  Tartarus,  and  she

hoped  that  Otus  and  Ephialtes  would  grow  big  enough  to
overthrow him.

One  night  as  the  brothers  slept  with  their  ears  to  the  ground,
they  heard  Mother  Earth  whisper  that  such  tall  and  handsome
youths  should not  let  themselves  be ruled by  Zeus. That  was  just
what  they  had  been  thinking  themselves,  for  they  were  vain,  as
many strong people are. They pulled up mountains, piled them on
top  of  each  other,  and  built  a  vast  new  mountain  as  high  as
Olympus.  From  the  top  they  called  to  Zeus  to  surrender  his
powers  to  them  and  move  out  of  his  palace  with  the  other
Olympians.  Artemis  could  stay  and  become  his  bride,  shouted
Otus, and Ephialtes would take Hera.

The two goddesses tossed their heads with scorn, and Zeus in a
fury  hurled  thunderbolts  at  the  ruffians.  Zeus’s  thunderbolts
glanced  off  harmlessly,  and  when  Ares  rushed  out  to  fight  them,
they  grabbed  him  and  crammed  him  into  a  bronze  jar  and
clamped the lid shut.

For once Zeus was really worried, but Apollo, the god of reason,
said that if no one could kill them they must be tricked into killing
each other. He persuaded Artemis to pretend that she was in love
with  Otus.  Otus  smirked  when  Apollo  called  to  him  that  Artemis
thought so much of him she had accepted his proposal and would
wait for him on the island of Naxos. That made Ephialtes jealous.
Why hadn’t Hera fallen in love with him? Wasn’t he as handsome
as his brother? But he swallowed his pride and went to Naxos with
his brother to meet the bride.

When  Artemis  saw  the  two  brothers  arriving,  she  quickly
changed  herself  into  a  white  deer  and  ran  across  their  path.  She
darted to and fro between them and the brothers, who were eager
huntsmen,  threw  their  javelins  at  the  deer.  Cleverly,  she  dodged
and  the  brothers  fell  to  the  ground,  pierced  by  each  other’s
javelins.  Neither  gods  nor  mortals  could  kill  the  giant  brothers,
but now they had put an end to each other and were thrown into
Tartarus, tied back to back with writhing snakes.

All the gods  thanked Artemis for saving  them, and pulled  Ares
out of the jar where he had been crouching all the while, howling
and screaming.

Orion was another giant son of Poseidon, but, unlike Otus and
Ephialtes,  he  was  modest.  He  was  a  great  hunter,  no  beast  could
escape  from  his  club  and  jeweled  sword,  but  he  never  forgot  to
praise Artemis as the greatest of all hunters.

One day Orion, who could walk on water as if it were land, came
to the island of Chios. The island was infested with lions, wolves,
and boars who roared and howled so loudly at night that the King
of  Chios  could  not  sleep.  He  promised  Orion  the  hand  of  his
daughter if he could rid the island of all the wild beasts. The king’s
daughter  was  beautiful,  her  father’s  greatest  treasure,  and  Orion
hunted  as  never  before.  Soon  there  was  not  a  wild  beast  left,  but
the king did not want to part with his daughter, and claimed that

he  could  still  hear  the  howling  of  wolves  at  night.  Orion  grew
angry  and  threatened  to  carry  off  the  princess,  but  the  king
soothed him with honeyed words, sent for wine, and filled his cup
so often that Orion drank too much and feel asleep. Stealthily the
evil king crept up and put out both his eyes.

“Now see if you can carry off my daughter,” he said.

Blind and helpless, Orion left Chios and staggered over the seas
in search of the sun, which he knew could restore his eyesight, but
he  could  not  find  his  way.  From  afar  he  heard  the  Cyclopes’
hammers  and  he  followed  the  sound  till  he  came  to  Hephaestus’
forge on the island of Lemnos. The kind god took pity on him and
lent him a Cyclops boy to show him the way to the East.

With the Cyclops on his shoulders to see for him, Orion walked
on till he met the rising sun. The sun let its healing rays play over
Orion’s  blind  eyes,  and  his  sight  was  restored.  Then  he  rushed
back  to  seek  revenge  on  the  false  king.  But  when  he  arrived,  the
palace was empty, for the king had seen his huge, menacing shape
against the sky and fled with his daughter.

Again  Orion  went  hunting  and  soon  forgot  the  king  and  the
beautiful  princess.  He  walked  from  island  to  island  and  after  a
while  he  came  to  the  island  of  Crete.  There  he  met  the  goddess
Artemis. She was glad to see him, for he could hunt as well as she
and was so very modest about it. Together they hunted wild goats
and  rejoiced  in  each  other’s  company.  Orion  was  the  only  man
Artemis  had  ever  favored,  and  her  brother  Apollo  grew  jealous.
One day while Artemis was away, he sent an enormous scorpion to
attack Orion. Orion’s club and mighty sword were no avail against
the scorpion’s poisonous tail. He turned to flee, but as he did, the
giant insect stung his heel.

Artemis  was  angry  with  her  brother  when  she  returned  and
found her companion dead. But she could not stay angry with her
twin for long, and he helped her hang Orion’s image in the skies as
a constellation so the great hunter would never be forgotten.

Over  the  stormy  winter  sea  the  constellation  of  Orion  glitters,
enormous and menacing, and the dark clouds flee before him like
wild  animals.  But  in  summer,  when  the  constellation  of  the
Scorpion rises over the horizon, Orion begins to sway and stagger,
and then he, in his turn, flees and disappears into the ocean.

HERMES, merriest of the Olympians, was the god of shepherds,

travelers,  merchants,  thieves,  and  all  others  who  lived  by  their
wits.

His  mother  Maia,  a  Titan’s  daughter,  lived  in  a  cave  on  lofty
Mount  Cyllene,  a  cave  so  deep  that  Hera  never  knew  that  Maia
was one of Zeus’s wives. Maia had therefore borne her son Hermes
in peace.

Hermes  was  very  precocious,  even  for  a  god.  His  mother  had
hardly wrapped him and put him into a basket when he began to
think of mischief. As soon as she had fallen asleep, he wriggled out
of his wrappings and tiptoed out of the cave. In the dark of night
he toddled straight to the pasture where Apollo kept a large herd
of white cows. Apollo liked music better than cows and he did not
even notice that Hermes stole into the pasture and picked out the
fifty best cows. To  keep Apollo from knowing  who  had  stolen his
herd and which way they had been driven, Hermes slyly wrapped
the  hoofs  of  the  cows  with  bark  to  disguise  their  prints,  and  tied
brooms  to  their  tails  so  they  would  erase  their  own  tracks.  To

confuse  Apollo  even  further,  he  drove  the  cows  backward  out  of
the pasture, and tied bundles of branches to his own little feet so it
looked  as  if  a  giant  had  led  something  into  the  pasture,  but
nothing out. He hurried home to Mount Cyllene and hid the stolen
cows in a grove. Two of them he sacrificed to the twelve Olympian
gods, not forgetting to include himself as the twelfth! Then he took
the entrails of the sacrificed cows, made seven strings of them, and
strung  them  tautly  across  an  empty  tortoise  shell.  When  he
plucked the strings, they made lovely music. He had invented the
first lyre. Pleased with himself, he hid the lyre under his arm and
tiptoed back into the cave. He climbed into his basket, closed his
eyes,  and  pretended  to  be  sound  asleep,  but  he  did  not  fool  his
mother. She knew what he had been up to.

“Shame  on  you,”  she  said,  “sneaking  out  at  night  and  stealing

Apollo’s cows.”

“Why,  Mother!”  said  Hermes.  “I  did  what  I  had  to  do  for  you
and for me. We don’t want to live in this dark cave forever. Soon I
will  be  seated  on  high  Olympus  as  one  of  the  twelve  great  gods,
and you too will live there in glory as my mother.” Then he pulled
out his lyre and played his mother to sleep with a lullaby.

At dawn Apollo stormed into the cave where Hermes lay in his
basket pretending to be asleep. But Apollo wasn’t fooled. An oracle
had told him who had stolen his herd, and he jerked little Hermes
out of his crib and commanded him to return the cows at once.

“How  could  I  have  stolen  your  cows?”  Hermes  whimpered,  “I
am  only  a  newborn  babe.  I  don’t  even  know  what  a  cow  is.  Look
for yourself and you can see that there is not a single cow hidden
in this cave.”

“You  are  not  only  a  thief  but  a  liar  as  well,”  raged  Apollo,  and

chased Hermes out of the cave and straight up to Olympus.

All the gods burst out laughing when they saw innocent-looking

little Hermes running with furious Apollo at his heels.

“Tell  this  thief  and liar to  give me back  my cows at  once,”  said

Apollo to their father, Zeus.

“Tell  my  big  brother  to  stop  bullying  me.  I  am  a  newborn  and
helpless infant. And  I am not  a  liar,”  said  Hermes.  “There  isn’t  a
cow in my mother’s cave.”

“If  they are  not  in  the cave, then  show  Apollo where they are,”
said Zeus, and hid a smile in his beard. He was proud of both his
sons and wanted them to be friends.

Hermes had to obey his father, and without any more tricks he
led his brother to the woods where the cows were hidden. Apollo
forgave  him,  but  when  he  counted  his  cows  and  found  that  two
were  missing,  his  anger  flared  again.  Hermes  had  expected  this
and quickly pulled out his lyre and began to play. Apollo listened
spellbound  to  the  beautiful  sounds  from  the  new  musical
instrument, and he quite forgot his anger. As the god of music, he
must  have  the  lyre  and  he  offered  Hermes  his  whole  herd  in
exchange for the instrument.

Hermes  drove  a  hard  bargain  and  Apollo  had  to  give  him  his
magic wand as well. From then on the two brothers were the best
of friends.

Never again did Hermes steal, though he was the god of thieves.
He never told a lie, but he didn’t always tell the whole truth. His
mother,  Maia,  had  no  further  reasons  to  be  ashamed  of  him.  As
the  mother  of  one  of  the  twelve  great  Olympians,  she  moved  up
with him to the glory of Olympus.

Zeus was so delighted with Hermes’ ready wit that he made him
the herald of the gods. He gave him a golden hat with wings, a pair
of winged sandals, and a cape under which he could hide his magic

tricks.  In  a  flash  he  could  move  from  place  to  place.  He  put  glib
words  on  the  tongues  of  politicians  and  helped  merchants  close
good bargains. He was as popular among mortals as he was among
the  gods.  Even  Hera  was  fond  of  him.  She  had  been  really  angry
with him only once, and that was when he had killed her hundred-
eyed servant,  Argus. Then  she  was  so furious that  she  demanded
he  be  punished,  and  called  all  the  great  and  minor  gods  to  sit  in
council  and  judge  him.  Each  god  was  given  a  pebble  and  told  to
cast his vote according to his decision. Those who found Hermes
guilty of a crime were to throw their pebbles at Hera’s feet, those
who  found  him  innocent  were  to  throw  their  pebbles  at  his  feet.
Hermes  talked  well  in  his  own  defense.  Was  it  a  crime  to  bore
someone to death? he asked. After all, that was what he had done
to  Argus.  The  gods  applauded  and  so  many  threw  their  votes  to
Hermes that he was completely buried in a heap of pebbles.

Ever after, travelers put up piles of stones along the roads, and
they  have  believed  that  Hermes  stands  inside,  helping  them  find

their way. These were the first cairns.

Hermes  also  guided  those  who  set  off  on  their  last  voyage.  He
touched the eyes of a dying man with his magic wand and led him
down to Hades in the underworld.

HADES,  lord  of  the  dead,  was  a  gloomy  god  of  few  words.

Mortals  feared  him  so  much  that  they  did  not  dare  mention  his
name,  for  they  might  attract  his  attention  and  he  might  send  for
them. Instead of Hades they called him the Rich One, and indeed,
rich he was. All the treasures in the ground belonged to him. They
in  his  desolate
also  called  him  the  Hospitable  One,  for
underground realm he always had room for another dead soul.

Hermes  guided  the  souls  of  the  dead  down  to  the  brink  of  the
river  Styx,  a  murky,  stagnant  river  that  flowed  around  the
underworld.  There  Hermes  left  them  in  charge  of  the  ferryman
Charon. If they had money to pay for their fare, Charon set them
across.  If  not,  he  refused  to  take  them,  for  he  was  greedy.  Those
who  could  not  pay  had  to  wander  about  till  they  found  the
pauper’s entrance to Hades. That is why, when a man died, his kin
put a coin under his tongue.

Sooner  or  later,  all  mortals  came  to  Hades.  Once  inside  his
realm, they whirled about forever like dry leaves in a cold autumn
wind.  Cerberus,  the  three-headed  watchdog  of  the  underworld,

stood at the gates. He let the dead souls enter, but, once past his
gnashing teeth and spiked tail, they could never go out again.

Hades  lived  in  a  dark  and  gloomy  palace  with  his  ice-cold
queen, Persephone. She was beautiful, but as silent and somber as
her husband, for she wasn’t happy. She had not come to rule the
joyless underworld of her own free will. She had been kidnaped by
Hades.

PERSEPHONE  grew  up  on  Olympus  and  her  gay  laughter  rang

through  the  brilliant  halls.  She  was  the  daughter  of  Demeter,
goddess  of  the  harvest,  and  her  mother  loved  her  so  dearly  she
could not bear to have her out of her sight. When Demeter sat on
her golden throne, her daughter was always on her lap; when she
went  down  to  earth  to  look  after  her  trees  and  fields,  she  took
Persephone.  Wherever  Persephone  danced  on  her  light  feet,
flowers  sprang  up.  She  was  so  lovely  and  full  of  grace  that  even
Hades, who saw so little, noticed her and fell in love with her. He
wanted  her  for  his  queen,  but  he  knew  that  her  mother  would
never consent to part with her, so he decided to carry her off.

One  day  as  Persephone  ran  about  in  the  meadow  gathering
flowers,  she  strayed  away  from  her  mother  and  the  attending
nymphs.  Suddenly,  the  ground  split  open  and  up  from  the
yawning crevice came a dark chariot drawn by black horses. At the
reins  stood  grim  Hades.  He  seized  the  terrified  girl,  turned  his
horses, and plunged back into the ground. A herd of pigs rooting
in  the  meadow  tumbled  into  the  cleft,  and  Persephone’s  cries  for
help  died  out  as  the  ground  closed  again  as  suddenly  as  it  had
opened. Up in the field, a little swineherd stood and wept over the

pigs  he  had  lost,  while  Demeter  rushed  wildly  about  in  the
meadow,  looking  in  vain  for  her  daughter,  who  had  vanished
without leaving a trace.

With  the  frightened  girl  in  his  arms,  Hades  raced  his  snorting
horses  down  away  from  the  sunlit  world.  Down  and  down  they
sped  on  the  dark  path  to  his  dismal  underground  palace.  He  led
weeping Persephone in, seated her beside him on a throne of black
marble,  and  decked  her  with  gold  and  precious  stones.  But  the
jewels brought her no joy. She wanted no cold stones. She longed
for warm sunshine and flowers and her golden-tressed mother.

Dead souls crowded out from cracks and crevices to look at their
new  queen,  while  ever  more  souls  came  across  the  Styx  and
Persephone  watched  them  drink  from  a  spring  under  dark
poplars. It was the spring of Lethe, and those who drank from its
waters  forgot  who  they  were  and  what  they  had  done  on  earth.
Rhadamanthus,  a  judge of the dead,  dealt  out  punishment to  the
souls of great sinners. They were sentenced to suffer forever under
the whips of the avenging Erinyes. Heroes were led to the Elysian
fields, where they lived happily forever in never-failing light.

Around  the  palace  of  Hades  there  was  a  garden  where
whispering  poplars  and  weeping  willows  grew.  They  had  no
flowers  and  bore  no  fruit  and  no  birds  sang  in  their  branches.
There  was  only  one  tree  in  the  whole  realm  of  Hades  that  bore
fruit.  That  was  a  little  pomegranate  tree.  The  gardener  of  the
underworld offered the tempting pomegranates to the queen, but
Persephone refused to touch the food of the dead.

Wordlessly she walked through the garden at silent Hades’ side

and slowly her heart turned to ice.

Above,  on  earth,  Demeter  ran  about  searching  for  her  lost
daughter,  and  all  nature  grieved  with  her.  Flowers  wilted,  trees
lost their leaves, and the fields grew barren and cold. In vain did
the  plow  cut  through  the  icy  ground;  nothing  could  sprout  and
nothing could grow while the goddess of the harvest wept. People
and animals starved  and the gods  begged  Demeter  again  to  bless

the earth. But she refused to let anything grow until she had found
her daughter.

Bent  with  grief,  Demeter  turned  into  a  gray  old  woman.  She
returned  to  the  meadow  where  Persephone  had  vanished  and
asked the sun if he had seen what had happened, but he said no,
dark  clouds  had  hidden  his  face  that  day.  She  wandered  around
the  meadow  and  after  a  while  she  met  a  youth  whose  name  was
Triptolemus.  He  told  her  that  his  brother,  a  swineherd,  had  seen
his  pigs  disappear  into  the  ground  and  had  heard  the  frightened
screams of a girl.

Demeter  now  understood  that  Hades  had  kidnaped  her
daughter,  and  her  grief  turned  to  anger.  She  called  to  Zeus  and
said that she would never again make the earth green if he did not
command  Hades  to  return  Persephone.  Zeus  could  not  let  the
world perish and he sent Hermes down to Hades, bidding him to
let Persephone go. Even Hades had to obey the orders of Zeus, and
sadly he said farewell to his queen.

Joyfully,  Persephone  leaped  to  her  feet,  but  as  she  was  leaving
with Hermes, a hooting laugh came from the garden. There stood
the  gardener  of  Hades,  grinning.  He  pointed  to  a  pomegranate
from which a few of the kernels were missing. Persephone, lost in
thought, had eaten the seeds, he said.

Then dark Hades smiled. He watched Hermes lead Persephone
up  to  the  bright  world  above.  He  knew  that  she  must  return  to
him, for she had tasted the food of the dead.

When Persephone again appeared on earth, Demeter sprang to
her  feet  with  a  cry  of  joy  and  rushed  to  greet  her  daughter.  No
longer was she a sad old woman, but a radiant goddess. Again she
blessed  her  fields  and  the  flowers  bloomed  anew  and  the  grain
ripened.

“Dear child,” she said, “never again shall we be parted. Together
we  shall  make  all  nature  bloom.”  But  joy  soon  was  changed  to
sadness, for Persephone had to admit that she had tasted the food
of the dead and must return to Hades. However, Zeus decided that
mother and daughter should not be parted forever. He ruled that
Persephone  had  to  return  to  Hades  and  spend  one  month  in  the
underworld for each seed she had eaten.

Every year, when Persephone left her, Demeter grieved, nothing
grew, and there was winter on earth. But as soon as her daughter’s
light  footsteps  were  heard,  the  whole  earth  burst  into  bloom.
Spring had come. As long as mother and daughter were together,
the earth was warm and bore fruit.

Demeter  was  a  kind  goddess.  She  did  not  want  mankind  to
starve  during  the  cold  months  of  winter  when  Persephone  was
away.  She  lent  her  chariot,  laden  with  grain,  to  Triptolemus,  the
youth who had helped her to find her lost daughter. She told him
to  scatter  her golden  grain over  the world and teach  men how  to
sow  it  in  spring  and  reap  it  in  fall  and  store  it  away  for  the  long
months when again the earth was barren and cold.

DIONYSUS, the god of wine, was the youngest of the Olympians.

He was the only one of the twelve great gods whose mother was a
mortal. His father was Zeus himself.

Jealous  Hera  hated  his  mother,  the  beautiful  princess  Semele,
and one day when Zeus was away, the goddess disguised herself as
an old crone and went to visit her. She talked about this and about
that,  pretending  to  be  very  friendly,  and  then  she  asked  why
Semele’s  husband  was  not  at  home,  and  what  kind  of  man  he
might be.

“He is nobody less than mighty Zeus,” Semele said proudly.

“How  can  you  be  so  sure  about  that?”  said  the  old  woman.  “I
know many husbands who claim to be the lord of all creation. Do
you have proof that he really is who he says he is? If I were you, I
would ask him to show himself in all his splendor.” Then she went
away, and Semele was left alone, wondering.

When  Zeus  returned,  Semele  asked  him  to  grant  her  a  wish.
Zeus,  who  loved  her  dearly,  swore  by  the  river  Styx  to  fulfill  any
wish she might have.

“Then  show  yourself  in  all  your  splendor,”  said  Semele.  Zeus
begged  her  to  change  her  wish,  for  he  knew  that  no  mortal  eyes
could  bear  the  sight  of  him  when  he  revealed  himself  as  the

flashing thunder-god, a hundred times brighter than the sun. But
Hera had planted the seed of suspicion so deep in Semele’s heart
that she refused to change her wish. Zeus had to keep his promise,
for  he  had  sworn  by  the  river  Styx,  the  most  solemn  oath  of  the
gods.

He  joined  together  the  smallest  storm  clouds  he  could  find,
chose  his  tiniest  lightning  bolt,  and  showed  himself  to  Semele  as
the mighty thunder-god. Even so, he was so brilliant that Semele
caught  fire and  burned to  cinders.  Zeus could  do  nothing  to  save
her.  She  went  down  to  Hades  as  a  fluttering  ghost.  Zeus  barely
managed to rescue her unborn son, and sewed him under the skin
of his own leg, and when the child was ready to be born, he sprang
forth as the immortal god Dionysus.

Zeus  knew  well  enough  who  was  the  cause  of  Semele’s  death,
and he gave her little son to Hermes and told him to hide the boy
from  Hera.  Hermes  carried  Dionysus  to  the  faraway  valley  of
Nysa, and left him in the care of a band of Maenads, the nymphs
of the valley. There Dionysus grew up with tigers and leopards for
playmates.

Large bunches of purple grapes grew on the sunny slope of the
valley of Nysa, and in time Dionysus invented the making of wine
from their juice. As a young and beautiful god, dressed in flowing
robes of royal purple, he went out into the world to teach men how
to  make  wine.  The  Maenads  went  with  him,  and  so  did  the
leopards  and  tigers,  and  ever  more  followers  joined  him.
Wherever he went he was worshiped as a new god, and his father,
Zeus, watched him with pleasure.

Dionysus returned to Greece and traveled from island to island
teaching the making of wine. One day as he was sleeping alone on
a  beach,  a  pirate  ship  sailed  by.  When  the  pirates  saw  the  richly
clad  youth,  they  thought  he  was  a  prince  and  carried  him  off  on
their ship to hold him for ransom. He did not wake from his heavy
slumber till the ship was far out at sea. With gentle words he tried
to persuade the pirates to take him back; he was not a prince, he
said, he was the god of wine, and his riches were not of this world.
The pirates laughed scornfully and sailed on, paying him no heed.

Suddenly  their  laughter  died,  for  out  of  the  sea  sprouted  vines
loaded with grapes. They grew, twining around the oars, winding
up the mast, and spreading over the whole ship as though it were
an  arbor.  Blood-red  wine  dripped  down  the  sail  and  the  air  was
filled with the sound of roaring tigers and braying asses. Dionysus
himself  seemed  to  grow  till  he  filled  the  ship  with  his  glory.
Horrified,  the  sailors  threw  themselves  into  the  sea,  but  they  did
not  drown,  for  Dionysus  was  a  kind  god.  He  changed  them  into
dolphins,  and  that  is  why  dolphins  are  the  most  human  of  all
creatures that live in the ocean.

Dionysus had brought much joy to mankind, and Zeus decided
that the time had come to give him a golden throne on Olympus.
Hera rose in anger and said she refused to share the hall with the
son of a mortal woman, but Zeus pounded his indomitable fist and
Hera sat silent.

There  were  only  twelve  thrones  in  the  hall,  so  kind  Hestia
quietly  rose  from  hers  and  said  that  Dionysus  could  have  it.  Her
place was at the hearth, she said; she needed no throne.

Before  seating  himself  on his throne Dionysus asked to  see his
mother for whom he had always longed. Zeus not only permitted
him to see her, but let him go down to Hades and bring her up to
the  glory  of  Olympus,  for  she  was  now  the  mother  of  one  of  the
great gods. Happily Dionysus entered the hall and seated himself
on  his  golden  throne.  The  air  was  filled  with  the  music  of  flutes
and tambourines. Never had there been such a din and merriment
on Olympus. Zeus looked around with great content and beckoned
to  his  cupbearer,  Ganymede,  bidding  him  fill  the  golden  goblets
with sweet nectar.

HERACLES
PROUDLY did the Muses sing of Heracles, often called Hercules,

the strongest man who ever lived on earth and the greatest of all
the  descendants  of  Danaüs.  His  mother  was  Princess  Alcmena,
granddaughter  of  Perseus  and  Andromeda,  and  famed  for  her
beauty and virtue.

His  father  was  Zeus,  so  Hera,  of  course,  hated  Alcmena  and
pursued  Heracles  with  her  wrath.  When  he  was  an  infant  the
goddess  sent  two  spotted  serpents  into  his  cradle,  but  little
Heracles simply grasped them in his powerful hands and squeezed
the  life  out  of  them.  He  grew  stronger  every  day,  but  his  trouble
was that he did not know his own strength.

Being  of  noble  birth,  he  had  to  learn  to  sing  and  play  the  lyre,
but  Heracles  would  much  rather  wrestle  and  fight.  One  day  his
music teacher Linus scolded him for singing out of tune. In a fit of
fury Heracles banged his lyre over the teacher’s head, harder than
he had meant, and the blow killed the poor man. Heracles was too
strong to have around a palace so he was sent into the mountains
as  a  shepherd.  There  he  could  use  his  tremendous  strength  on
prowling  beasts.  Soon  he  had  rid  the  countryside  around  Thebes
of  lions  and  wolves,  and  the  fame  of  his  strength  spread  far  and
wide. He came back from the mountains as a hero, and the King of
Thebes  regarded  him  so  highly  that  he  gave  him  his  daughter  in
marriage.  Hera  did  not  like  this  at  all,  and  she  made  Heracles
insane. Raving mad, he swatted down his own children, mistaking
them  for  wild  beasts.  When  he  regained  his  senses,  he  was
horrified at what he had done, and went to the oracle of Delphi to
learn what he must do to atone for his crime. He was told that he

must serve for ten years as the slave of his cousin Eurystheus and
perform ten labors for him.

Hera  was  pleased,  for  Eurystheus,  the  King  of  Mycenae,  was  a
weak  little  man  who  hated  his  strong  cousin  Heracles.  With  her
help the king would surely think of the hardest tasks for Heracles
to perform.

For  his  first  four  labors  Eurystheus  sent  Heracles  to  rid  the

nearby countryside of dangerous beasts and monsters.

In the valley of Nemea dwelt a monstrous lion whose hide was
so  tough  it  could  not  be  pierced  by  any  weapons.  It  was  one  of
Echidna’s  dreadful  offspring,  which  Zeus  had  let  live  as  a
challenge to future heroes.

Heracles chased it out of its lair, seized it in his bare hands, and
squeezed it to death. Then he skinned the beast with its own claws,
and with the impenetrable skin of the Nemean lion slung over his
head and shoulders, he reported back to Eurystheus, his first labor
performed.

In  the  swamps  of  Lerna  there  lived  a  nine-headed  Hydra,
another  of  Echidna’s  brood.  This  monster  was  so  poisonous  that
the fumes from its breath alone were enough to kill whatever came
close to it.

Heracles filled his enormous lungs with air, held his breath, and
ran at the Hydra. Swinging his club, he knocked off its heads, and
one after the other they rolled to the ground. But no sooner had he
knocked  off  one  head  than  a  new  one  grew  in  its  place.  He  half
turned  around  and  let  out  enough  air  to  call  to  his  charioteer  to
bring  a  firebrand  and  sear  the  necks.  Then  no  new  heads  could
sprout.  When  Hera  saw  that  Heracles  was  winning  over  the
Hydra, she sent a giant crab to pinch his heel. With a mighty kick
Heracles sent the giant crab flying as he knocked off the last of the
heads.  Then  he  dipped  his  arrows  in  the  Hydra’s  blood,  making
them so poisonous that a mere scratch from them was deadly, and
he returned to Mycenae, his second labor performed.

On  the  slopes  of  Mount  Erymanthus  roamed  a  wild  and
dreadful  boar,  with  tusks  as  sharp  as  swords.  Eurystheus  sent
Heracles to bring this beast back alive.

With  loud  yells,  Heracles  chased  the  boar  out  of  its  lair  and
drove  it  ahead  of  him  all  the  way  to  the  top  of  the  snow-capped
mountain. The heavy beast sank into the snow and it was easy for
Heracles to catch and subdue it. He pushed, dragged, and rolled it
all the way  down  to  the gates of Mycenae.  When  Eurystheus  saw
the fearful boar, he dived into an urn and barely dared to peek out.

Then Eurystheus sent Heracles to rid the Stymphalian Lake of a
swarm  of  dangerous  birds.  They  had  feathers  of  brass  so  sharp
that, when one of them fell to the ground, it killed whomever it hit.
But  they  could  not  penetrate  Heracles’  lion  skin,  and  he  made
such a  din, with a  huge  rattle,  that  the birds took fright and flew
away, never to return.

Eurystheus was distressed to see with what great ease Heracles
had performed his first four labors. Now he sent him to bring back
alive one  of  the sacred hinds of Artemis. He  hoped  that  Heracles
would harm the creature with his brute strength and thereby earn
the wrath of the goddess. But Heracles pursued the swift deer with
great patience over hills and dales. The year was almost over when
at  last  he  caught  the  deer.  With  great  care  he  carried  it  back  to
Mycenae.

Next, to humble his strong cousin, Eurystheus ordered Heracles
to  clean  the  stables  of  King  Augeas,  who  lived  across  the
mountains  to  the  west.  King  Augeas  had  huge  herds  and  his
stables  and  barnyards  had  not  been  cleaned  for  years.  Heaps  of
dung rose mountain high. No man alive could clean his stables in
a  year,  thought  Eurystheus.  But  Heracles  with  tremendous
strength  changed  the  course  of  two  rivers.  The  waters  flooded
through stables and barnyards and washed them clean in less than
a day.

Eurystheus now, on the advice of Hera, sent Heracles far afield
for  his  last  four  labors.  He  must  travel  way  to  the  east  and  fetch
back  to  Mycenae  the  golden  girdle  of  Hippolyta,  Queen  of  the
Amazons.  The  Amazons  were  a  tribe  of  wild  and  warlike  women
who rode better and fought harder than any men. Eurystheus was
sure  that  even  Heracles  would  be  overwhelmed  by  the  furious
women.  But  when  Heracles  arrived  in  Amazon  land,  the  proud
queen  was  so  taken  by  the  sight  of  his  bulging  muscles  that  she
gave him her belt without a fight. She would gladly have given him
her hand in the bargain, but Hera, in the disguise of an Amazon,
spread  the  rumor  that  Heracles  had  come  to  kidnap  Hippolyta.
The Amazons threw themselves upon Heracles, but for once they
had found their master! Heracles swung his mighty club, and the
little  Amazon  husbands,  who  were  spinning  and  cooking  and
tending  the  babies,  were  amazed  to  see  their  dangerous  wives
subdued by a single man.

In triumph, Heracles returned to Mycenae with Hippolyta’s belt.

He could not bring the queen, she had been killed in the fight.

Far to the north there lived a king whose name was Diomedes.
He was a very inhospitable king and had trained his four mares to
devour all strangers who came to his land.

Now  Eurystheus  sent  Heracles  to  capture  the  four  man-eating

mares and bring them back alive.

Heracles traveled to the north, slew King Diomedes, and threw
him  to  his  own  mares.  When  the  mares  had  eaten  the  evil  king,
they  were  so  tame  that  they  let  Heracles  drive  them  back  to  the
gates of Mycenae.

Then  Eurystheus  sent  Heracles  south  to  catch  a  fierce,  fire-
breathing bull on the island of Crete. The Cretans, who were great
bullfighters,  could  not  catch  the  bull,  but  Heracles  seized  the
charging  bull  by  the  horns  without  heeding  the  flames  from  its
nostrils, flung it to the ground, and returned to Mycenae, bringing
the subdued beast. Eurystheus was glad he had a safe urn to hide
in.

For his tenth labor, Heracles was sent to an island far out in the
ocean,  to  bring  back  a  huge  herd  of  red  cows.  They  belonged  to
Geryon, a monster with three bodies on one pair of legs.

Heracles walked off with a powerful stride and soon reached the
end  of  all  land  in  the  west.  The  only  boat  he  could  spot  was  the
golden vessel of Helios, the sun. Heracles aimed his mighty bow at
the  sun  and  threatened  to  shoot  him  from  the  sky  if  he  did  not
lend  it  to  him.  Helios  did  not  dare  to  refuse,  and  he  let  Heracles
take his golden boat.

Before he sailed off, Heracles pulled up two huge crags and set
them  down,  one  on  each  side  of  the  strait  that  separates  Europe
from  Africa.  There  they  stand  to  this  day,  called  the  Pillars  of
Hercules.

When Heracles was out at sea and the waves rose high around
him, he aimed a poisoned arrow at the waves, threatening to shoot
them if they did not still at once. The waves flattened in fear and
Heracles sailed on to Geryon’s island. He began at once to load the
herd of red cows, and Geryon’s watchman and his two-headed dog
rushed  at  him.  With  one  swing  of  his  mighty  club  Heracles  did

away  with  them  both.  Then  Geryon  himself  came  running  to
attack him, his three huge bodies swaying on his thin legs. Calmly
Heracles  lifted  his  bow,  took  careful  aim,  and  sent  a  poisoned
arrow  through  all  of  the  monster’s  three  bodies.  As  time  was
getting  short,  Heracles  rowed  back  as  fast  as  he  could  with  the
herd.  When  he  arrived  at  the  mainland,  Hera  sent  a  swarm  of
gadflies to sting the cows and they scattered all over Europe. Still,
Heracles managed to round them up and bring them to the gates
of  Mycenae  just  before  the  year  was  up.  There,  Eurystheus
sacrificed the cows to Hera, and, gratified, the goddess whispered
into his ear that he must demand two more labors from Heracles,
for his charioteer had helped him to singe the heads of the Hydra,
and  not  he  but  the  waters  of  two  rivers  had  washed  the  Augean
stables clean.

Heracles  scowled  but  he  bowed  his  head  in  submission,  for  he
had  won  much  glory  on  his  ten  labors  and  hoped  to  win  some
more.

For  his  eleventh  labor,  Heracles  was  sent  to  find  Hera’s  secret
garden  of  the  Hesperides  and  pick  three  golden  apples  from  the
little apple tree that Mother Earth had given Hera for her wedding
gift.  Nereus,  the  Old  Gray  Man  of  the  Sea,  was  the  only  one  on

earth who knew where the garden was, but he would not reveal the
secret. When Heracles seized him to squeeze the secret out of him,
Nereus  tried  to  escape  by  changing  himself  into  all  kinds  of
animals. But Heracles held on to him and at last Nereus had to tell
him that the garden of the Hesperides lay west of the setting sun,
not far from where the Titan Atlas stood, holding up the sky.

On his way to the garden, Heracles heard the groans of the Titan
Prometheus,  who  was  chained  to  the  Caucasus  Mountains.
Heracles  was  in  a  hurry,  but  he  felt  sorry  for  the  Titan  and  took
time off to tear apart his chains. Zeus, impressed by the strength
of his son, let him do it. In gratitude Prometheus warned Heracles
not to pick the golden apples himself, or he would die. They were
apples of immortality and could be picked only by a god.

Heracles traveled over land and over sea, and at last he came to
the  garden  of  the  Hesperides.  Nearby  stood  the  Titan  Atlas,  and
Heracles offered to hold up the sky for him if he would pick three
golden apples from Hera’s tree. Atlas said he would be glad to be
rid  of  his  heavy  burden  for  a  while,  but  he  feared  the  dragon
Ladon, which lay under the tree watching it with all the eyes of his
hundred  heads.  A  hundred-headed  dragon  could  not  frighten
Heracles. He drew his bow and shot it. Then he took the sky on his
shoulders, and Atlas reached out and picked the apples. The three
little nymphs who tended the tree wept bitter tears, but they could
not stop Atlas, now that the watchful dragon was dead.

Heracles’ knees started to buckle, so heavy was the weight of the

sky, but Atlas stretched himself, enjoying his freedom.

“I  might  as  well  take  these  apples  to  Eurystheus  myself,”  said
the Titan, and started to walk away. Heracles well understood that
Atlas  had  no  intention  of  ever  coming  back,  but  he  pretended  to
agree.

“Very well,” he said, “just hold the sky while I make a pad of my

lion skin, the sky is hard on my shoulders.”

This  sounded  reasonable  to  Atlas.  He  put  down  the  golden

apples and braced himself against the vault of the sky.

“Thank  you  for  picking  the  apples,”  said  Heracles,  and  hurried

homeward.

On  his  way  to  Mycenae,  Heracles  was  stopped  by  the  giant
wrestler Antaeus. He lived in a hut beside the road, and forced all
travelers to  wrestle  with him. He  was  a  son of Mother  Earth and
could not die as long as he touched her, so he always won and had
built his hut of the skulls and bones of his victims. When Heracles
threw the giant to the ground, thinking he was dead, but saw him
springing up revived, he understood what was happening. Seizing
Antaeus, he held him in the air until he had squeezed all life out of
him.

Heracles hurried  on to  Mycenae  and gave the golden  apples to
Eurystheus.  But  Eurystheus  did  not  dare  to  keep  them.  He  gave
them to Athena, who took them back to Hera’s garden, where they
belonged.

For  his  twelfth  labor  Heracles  had  to  go  to  the  underworld,
capture  Cerberus, the snarling,  three-headed watchdog  of Hades,
and bring him to Mycenae.

Heracles searched far and wide till at last he found an entrance
to  the  underworld  near  Helios’  evening  palace,  far  to  the  west.
Setting  his  face  in  a  terrible  scowl,  he  walked  straight  down  to
Hades.  The  fluttering  souls  trembled  and  Hades  himself  was  so
frightened at the sight that he told him to take the dog, only please
not to treat it too roughly. Cerberus growled and lashed out with
his  spiked  tail,  but  Heracles  threw  his  arms  around  him  and
squeezed  him  till  the  dog’s  three  tongues  hung  out.  Whining,
Cerberus let Heracles drag him to the upper world and all the way
to the gates of Mycenae. When Eurystheus saw the fearful hound,
once again he dived into the urn and cowered there, not daring to
make a sound. Heracles did not know what to do with the dog, so
he dragged Cerberus all the way back down to Hades.

Now  Heracles  was  free.  He  had  performed  not  only  ten  but
twelve  labors.  He  had  atoned  for  his  sins  and  Zeus  was  very
pleased with his strong son. He was pleased with Hera, too, for she
had  unknowingly  helped  Heracles win  more glory and fame than
any other hero on earth. Admired by everyone, Heracles traveled
all over Greece, performing more heroic deeds and making many
friends.

But Hera, still relentless, again made him insane and he swatted
men down like flies. When he recovered his senses, he once more
had to atone for his sins, and this time it was his father, Zeus, who
meted out his punishment, seeing to it that there was no glory to
be won.

Zeus sentenced Heracles to serve for three years as the slave of
Queen Omphale of Lydia. She dressed him in woman’s clothes and
made the strongest man in the world sit at her feet, spinning and
sewing with his huge hands, while she herself donned his lion skin
and brandished his club. Heracles grumbled and groaned, but he
did as he was ordered. When his three years at last were over, he
had learned his lesson of humility.

Again  he  performed  heroic  deeds  and  his  friends  were  glad  to
see  him  back.  One  of  his  great  friends  was  Admetus,  King  of
Thessaly,  under  whom  Apollo  once  had  served  when  he  was  a

slave  on  earth.  To  thank  Admetus  for  his  kindness,  Apollo  had
persuaded the Fates not to cut his thread of life when his time to
die had come, as long as Admetus could find someone else willing
to  die  in  his  stead.  That  would  be  easy,  thought  the  king.  His
faithful  men  were  always  saying  that  his  life  was  dearer  to  them
than  their  own.  King  Admetus  had  always  been  afraid  of  dying
early, for he was very happy with his beautiful queen, Alcestis. The
king  and  the  queen  were  both  fond  of  Heracles  and  always
welcomed  him  warmly.  But  one  day  when  Heracles  came  to  the
palace,  King  Admetus  greeted  him  alone.  He  looked  sad  and
downcast.  When  Heracles  asked  him  what  was  wrong,  he  said
nothing  except  that  a  woman  of  the  household  had  died  and  he
must  go  to  her  funeral.  And  he  left  Heracles  alone  with  the
servants. They too looked sad. They waited on him in silence and
did  not  answer  his  questions.  Heracles  ate,  drank,  and  made
merry  alone  and  at  last  he  grew  impatient,  grasped  one  of  the
servants,  and  forced  him  to  speak.  The  servant  told  him  that  the
time had come for Admetus to die, and he had turned to his men
and asked one of them to die in his stead. But now not one of them
had been willing. Admetus then went to his parents, who were old
and  weary  of  life,  and  asked  them  to  die  in  his  stead.  They  too
refused.  But  when  he  returned  to  his  palace,  he  found  Queen
Alcestis  setting  off  for  the  realm  of  the  dead.  She  loved  him  so
much, she said, she would gladly give her life for him, and the king
was so fond of his own life that he let his queen depart. Now the
king and all the household were mourning for Alcestis.

Heracles shed big tears when he heard this sad story, but, being
a  man  of  action,  he  seized  his  club  and  strode  off  to  the
underworld to force Hades to give Alcestis back. Such a loving wife
should not be allowed to die.

Heracles did not have to use his club. Cerberus slunk out of the
way as he stormed into the palace of Hades. The lord of the dead,

himself,  had  a  cold,  unloving  queen  and  he  was  so  moved  when
Heracles told him of Alcestis’ devotion that he let her go.

Heracles brought Queen Alcestis back to King Admetus and the
grief  in  the  palace  changed  to  great  joy.  Now  they  all  ate,  drank,
and  made merry  together and Alcestis grew  famous far and wide
as the most devoted wife who ever lived.

Heracles too wanted a wife and he chose Deianira, a Caledonian
princess, for his bride. Deianira had already been promised to the
river-god Achelous, but she dreaded the thought of being married
to  a  river-god,  who  could  change  his  shape  at  will.  She  would
never  know  in  which  shape  her  husband  would  come  home  at
night.  She  would  rather  marry  the  great  hero  Heracles.  The  two
suitors agreed to wrestle, the victor to have the Princess Deianira.
Of course, Heracles won. The river-god rushed at him in the shape
of a bull, and Heracles seized him by a horn, wrenched it off, and
threw  him  to  the  ground  before  he  had  time  to  change  into
something else. So Heracles and Deianira were married and were
very happy together.

One  day  as  they  were  out  traveling,  they  came  to  a  swollen
stream. Heracles forded it with ease, but Deianira was afraid and
stood  on  the  bank.  Along  came  the  centaur  Nessus  and  politely
offered to carry her across. But Nessus, like all centaurs, was fond
of pretty girls and before he had reached midstream he had made
up his mind  to  carry  her off. Once  on the other  side,  he  galloped
off with her. Deianira screamed for help, Heracles shot a poisoned
arrow at the centaur and Nessus fell to the ground. Before he died
he whispered to Deianira, “Take some of my blood and save it. If
you ever fear that you are losing your husband’s love, paint some
of the blood on his tunic and he will love you again.”

Deianira  carefully  saved  the  drops  of  blood,  for  she  knew  well

that many a girl would like to steal her magnificent husband.

One  day  as  Heracles  was  away  at  war,  he  won  a  great  victory
and  sent  a  messenger  home  for  his  best  tunic.  He  wanted  to
celebrate  with  his  men,  but  Deianira  thought  he  wanted  to  make
himself handsome for a girl. She painted some of Nessus’ blood on
the  tunic.  As  soon  as  Heracles  put  it  on,  he  felt  as  though  a
thousand  fires  were  burning  him.  It  was  not  a  love  potion  that
Nessus  had  given  Deianira,  but  the  deadly  poison  of  the  Hydra
from Heracles’ arrow, mixed with Nessus’ blood. Heracles was so
strong that  the poison could  not  kill  him, but  his sufferings were
unbearable. He ordered his men to build a funeral pyre, spread his
lion  skin  over  the  top,  and  lay  down  on  it.  Then  he  gave  his  bow
and  deadly  arrows  to  his  young  friend,  Philoctetes,  as  a  parting
gift. As the flames rose around him, a loud thunderclap was heard,
and Heracles, by the order of Zeus, rose up to Olympus, reclining
on his lion skin.

The gods all welcomed Heracles and were glad to have him with
them, for the Fates had predicted that Olympus would be attacked
by  a  fearful  enemy  and  the  Olympians  could  be  saved  only  if  the
strongest man ever born fought on their side. The prediction soon
came  to  pass.  In  a  last  effort  to  defeat  the  mighty  thunder-god
Zeus,  Mother  Earth  had  given  birth  to  fifty  snake-legged  giants,
who  surrounded  Olympus  and  tried  to  storm  the  palace.  They
seemed  unconquerable,  for,  like  Antaeus,  whom  Heracles  had
fought  on  earth,  they  sprang  up  again  revived  as  soon  as  they
touched  Mother  Earth.  Heracles  knew  what  to  do,  and  with  his
help  the  gods  won  over  the  giants  and  cast  them  down  into  the

dismal  pit  of  Tartarus.  Heracles  was  now  the  hero  of  Mount
Olympus,  beloved  by  all  the  gods.  Even  Hera  begged  him  to
forgive  her  and  gave  him  her  daughter  Hebe,  goddess  of  eternal
youth,  for  his  Olympian  bride.  From  then  on  Heracles  lived  in
eternal  bliss,  forever  a  joy  to  the  gods.  His  father  Zeus  was  very
pleased.
