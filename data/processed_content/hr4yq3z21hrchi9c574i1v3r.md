# ABOUT THIS EDITION

The reputation of Chapman Piloting & Seamanship as a unique and authoritative resource for recreational mariners rests on the work of countless organizations and hundreds of experts and editors over the 100 years since its first publication in 1917. Their collective wisdom is at the heart of this book, but to name them all would be impossible. The editorial team for the 69th edition is as follows:

Jonathan Eaton, Co-Editor

Jonathan Eaton developed, edited, and published some 400 boating books in his career as editor and publisher of McGraw-Hill’s International Marine book imprint. He has developed books and reference guides for the U.S. Power Squadrons, the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, the American Sailing Association, and West Marine. As co-owner of Tilbury House Publishers, he has published A Man for All Oceans: Captain Joshua Slocum and the First Solo Voyage Around the World. A former sailing instructor and intercollegiate dinghy racer, Jon crews aboard a Frers 33, crewed a Contessa 32 in the Lake Ontario 300 Regatta of 2019, and sails a C&C 24 and a Beneteau First 285 along the coast of Maine whenever he can.

John Wooldridge, Co-Editor

John Wooldridge is a lifelong boater who began writing and photographing boats professionally in 1977. He is Editor-at-Large for Power & Motoryacht magazine and has served as the Editor-in-Chief of Yachting and PassageMaker magazines. He is a past contributor to Chapman, wrote the Chapman Boater’s Log, edited Chapman Chart No. 1, and holds a U.S. Coast Guard OUPV 50-Ton license. John has cruised both coasts of North America and the waters of Europe and the Western Pacific, and has made a transatlantic voyage.

John Whiting, Consulting Editor

John H. Whiting, a lifelong boater, retired in 2016 from the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary. His Auxiliary qualifications included Coxswain, Personal Watercraft Operator, and Telecommunications Specialist. He was also an Auxiliary Operational Specialist with training in Coastal Navigation, Seamanship, Search and Rescue, and Weather, and he performed safety patrols on Arizona lakes. John recently moved from Arizona to western Maine, where he and his wife, Leanne, explore inland waters aboard their Sea Nymph FM146 fishing boat.

These editors thank Charles B. Husick and Dan Fales for their contributions to the 67th edition; Richard Thiel, Adam Cort, Richard “Doc” Clinchy, and Peter Janssen for their contributions to the 68th edition; and Elbert “Mack” Maloney for piloting the Chapman ship through many editions prior to his passing in 2014.

# PREFACE

From its first edition in 1917, Chapman has been a book for dreamers as well as doers. The dust jacket of the 1964 – 65 edition features a photo of a chart spread out on a desk. Dividers and parallel rules lie on the chart, ready for someone to plot out a coastal passage. In the background are a model square-rigged ship and a globe showing the Americas and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, suggesting that a mariner could go anywhere in the world with this book and the right boat. Chapman then looked like what it was and still is—the doorway to a magic kingdom.

As it happened, 1965 was the year that Charles F. Chapman met with Elbert “Mack” Maloney in New York City and convinced Mack to take over the writing, organizing, and updating of Chapman—which Mack did for the next 42 years. In 2007, Mack stepped back to a consulting editor role but remained the indispensable member of the Chapman team. He was there to welcome us in 2012 and advise us in the preparation of the 67th edition. Nine years later, we are proud to be links in an unbroken chain stretching back to the first edition of Chapman more than 100 years ago. Notwithstanding the occasional confusions of two Johns and a Jon in a team of three (“Who’s on first?”), working on this book is a rare privilege.

Preparing this edition amid a global pandemic has given us ample time to reflect on the role of boating in modern life. Our conclusion—from statistics, anecdotal evidence, and what we see on the water—is that boating is thriving. And why not? It’s an outdoor pursuit offering the freedom of waterborne exploration, the health of the open air, and family fun that can be enjoyed by children and grandparents alike. As an antidote for confinement, it has never been more relevant and enjoyable. Maybe that’s the reason for an unprecedented increase in boat sales in 2020, as people took to the water for a form of recreation that places a premium on independence and self-guided adventure.

From stand-up paddleboards to sail-powered hydrofoils and jet-powered, joystick-controlled powerboats, boating is more varied than ever. Who knows what new trends will be in the wind for the 70th edition? We are glad that Chapman is here to ensure that seamanship and navigation knowledge—what mariners call “sea sense”—is available to a new generation of sailors and power-boaters. We know that boaters will continue to advocate for clean waterways and environmental awareness, as they always have. And we think it’s not just possible but likely that Chapman will still be the indispensable boating resource 100 years from now.

It is only fitting that Mack Maloney should have the last word. His preface to the 67th edition ended like this: “Following in the true Chapman tradition, this edition remains clear, thorough, and always comradely—a book designed to help you and everyone on board your boat stay safe, have fun, and become skilled as a boater. Above all, I wish you as much joy from your boating years as I have had from mine.”

# The Tradition of CHAPMAN PILOTING & SEAMANSHIP

Few books in today’s world are used with equal enthusiasm by parents, children, and grandchildren. Few books grow with the changing technology of an age-old art and science. Few books are loved and respected—and at the same time are so authoritative that they are relied upon to set standards in a court of law. One of these rare books is Chapman Piloting & Seamanship, now in its tenth decade.

The story of how this book became so famous and has endured so long has many fascinating parts. The tradition began with a dynamic personality, and its evolution parallels the extraordinary growth of boating as one of North America’s favorite recreational activities, and testifies to the talent and dedication of the hundreds of people who have been directly involved with developing the content and maintaining the very high editorial standards for all the 66 editions.

## The Early Days

The story begins during World War I, when Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy, asked Charles F. Chapman, editor of Motor Boating magazine, to write a manual of instruction in small boat seamanship for young men who were joining the Navy, Coast Guard, or Merchant Marine. He did so in an incredible three days, and in 1917 the first edition of Practical Motor Boat Handling, Seamanship, and Piloting was published. This small book contained 144 pages in a 5-inch by 7-inch format—its subtitle tells all:

“A handbook containing information which every motor boatman should know. Everything prepared for the man who takes pride in handling his own boat and getting the greatest enjoyment out of cruising. Adapted for the yachtsman interested in fitting himself to be of service to his Government in time of war.”

Some of the information came from government sources. Part of the handbook was a fascinating excerpt from the Cunard Line’s instructions to deck officers on its transantlantic steamships. Much of the book was a paste-up of instructional articles from what was already one of the world’s leading boating magazines.

In addition to preparing the manual, Chapman offered the Navy the use of the Power Squadrons’ “machinery ready to put into instant operation the training of great numbers of men required for the Naval Reserve Forces.” Roosevelt accepted this offer with gratitude and within a year more than 5,000 men who had attended Squadrons’ classes and used the instruction manual entered the armed services.

This is how it all began! Chap assembled material that had been published in Motor Boating magazine, and created a handbook for instruction of volunteer boatmen assisting the U.S. Navy in World War I. This slim volume, which would evolve into the “Chapman” that we know today, was listed in this April 1917 advertisement at a paperbound price of 50 cents.

### CHARLES F. CHAPMAN

As Chief Commander of the United State Power Squadrons, Charles F. Chapman is seen reviewing the fleet at a Squadron summer activity.

The man who created and developed this nautical bestseller, Charles Frederic Chapman, was born in Norwich, Connecticut in 1881. With easy access to the nearby Thames River, “Chap,” as he was affectionately known throughout his life, became interested in boats, and quickly decided that his life’s interests lay afloat. At Cornell University he studied naval architecture and marine engineering, graduating in 1905.

Settling in Manhattan, he bought his first motorboat; she was the Megohm, a trim 16-footer powered by a pint-size, one-cylinder Detroit engine that produced all of two horsepower. He joined the New York Motor Boat Club, where he was later to become its commodore. This club was active in the new American Power Boat Association, and Chap became chairman of the APBA’s racing commission, the sanctioning body for motorboat races in the U.S. He wrote the first power boat racing rules, and was secretary of APBA for 25 years.

But it wasn’t all on paper. He began racing himself, and soon was declared a rising star among motorboat pilots. In 1909 the boat Chap was skippering in an ocean race from New York to Marblehead, Massachusetts, caught fire and sank. While three men balanced in a tiny dinghy, three others clung to life by hanging on to its gunwales. Eventually, the entire crew was rescued by a passing schooner. No doubt the incident played a large part in Chap’s lifelong dedication to instruction in boating safety.

Chap continued racing and was a highly ranked competitor in the 1920s. To dramatize the speed potential of motorboats, he organized and participated in long distance races such as Gar Wood’s hydroplane against the famous train, the Twentieth Century Limited. Chap served as navigator when the speedboat won the race from Albany to New York City in 1923. Another boat versus train race was from Miami to New York, and there is still a Chapman Trophy for the fastest time in a powerboat between those two cities.

In 1912, he was brought to the attention of a man busy building his own reputation—William Randolph Hearst. Hearst owned the magazine Motor Boating and was looking for an editor. “It’s yours, Chap. Take it and run it as you wish,” was the assignment. And that is exactly what Chap did—for the next 56 years.

The year Chap took over the helm of the magazine it sold for ten cents a copy and reached a few thousand readers a month. Chap set his sights high, declaring, “The boating business is a sleeping giant and I’m trying to wake it.” Motor Boating soon began to grow in both stature and circulation. The magazine celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2007 at the top of its field before being hit hard by the 2009 recession. The print edition ceased publication in 2011, but Bonnier was said to be preparing for digital publication in 2012.

Chap also used his knowledge elsewhere to further the cause of boating education. In 1913 and 1914 he was one of ten men who first met at the Boston Yacht Club and later at the New York Yacht Club to form the United States Power Squadrons. He was for many years the chairman of the flag and etiquette committee and designed the USPS ensign. At various times, he was Treasurer, Vice Commander, and for two terms, Chief Commander. He administered the first national boating tests. The organization, in recognition of his long and valuable service, gave him USPS Certificate No. 1.A. Charles F. Chapman died in 1976.

## The Story of the Book Continues

As boating grew, so, unfortunately, did boating accidents and fatalities. In an effort to increase safe practices on the water and create a more informed group of participants, Chap used the pages of Motor Boating to start what he called “The Correspondence Course.” Each month an article on a particular subject would appear, and would end with a series of questions. Readers from all over the country sent in answers, and those who passed were given a certificate. This was to become the first formal boating safety course in the nation, and it led to a forerunner of the book you now hold in your hands.

By 1922 Chap’s book had undergone six revisions and in that year was retitled Piloting, Seamanship & Small Boat Handling. Now the emphasis of the book was clearly small-craft operation and safety. Still mostly a compilation of articles from the magazine, the book took on the appearance of a scrapbook of the sea and a self-instruction course in boat operation. It was constantly being revised to keep up with advances in the boating industry and ever-changing government regulations.

The book grew—in size and in usage. The United States Power Squadrons used it for free courses for the public, as well as for advanced courses for its members. The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary adopted it for its courses given by various flotillas around the country. Boaters whose navigating skills were part of their lives took pride in having a copy of the book on board. The book also acquired nicknames: “The Blue Book,” “The Bible of Boating,” and just plain “Piloting” or “Chapman.”

## Help from Many Quarters

While Chap directed each new edition for almost 50 years, he counted on help from many assistants, and indeed, from the book’s readers. With each new edition came suggestions from staff members, professional boat captains, airplane pilots, amateur sailors, cruising boaters, and others who loved the sea. He also relied on the cooperation of the U.S. Power Squadrons, the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Coast & Geodetic Survey and the Lake Survey (both now a part of NOS, the National Ocean Service), the U.S. Navy, and most of all the U.S. Coast Guard. Scores of manufacturers of equipment, boats, instruments, and other nautical gear have always assisted by providing illustrations.

Through all those years, a handful of individuals have made contributions that may be almost as responsible as Chap himself for keeping the first 50 or so editions of this book the most popular, authoritative, and current book on boating published. Their names include William H. Koelbel, who worked closely with Chap for more than 20 years and wrote a number of chapters during that time; Morris Rosenfeld, the famed marine photographer; and Morris’s son Stanley, who continued the tradition; there were also Peter Barlow, Gardner Emmons, Dr. John Wilde; Robert Danforth Ogg, co-inventor of the Danforth anchor, and Gale Foster of the Cordage Institute.

Also to be mentioned as contributors are the readers, the unofficial collaborators. The members and instructors of the U.S. Power Squadrons make suggestions, catch the minor typographical mistakes, sometimes argue with the editor about flag etiquette or fine points of navigational techniques and, perhaps most importantly, ask hundreds of meaningful questions.

The New York Yacht Club, where many of the early organizational meetings of the United States Power Squadrons were held.

## The Modern Era

“Chapman’s” continued to grow in the years following World War II, in which it was again used for the training of many men in the use of military small craft. But it had something of the appearance of a hodgepodge scrapbook, and in 1966 a complete reorganization of the book was planned by Chap and John Whiting, who succeeded to the title of Publisher in 1968 when Chap retired at the age of 86. The publishing plan became one for a “living book” that could adapt to the technological and governmental changes that were happening to boating.

First, Elbert S. Maloney (better known as “Mack”) was assigned to the work of completely rewriting the book, several chapters a year, with updates in every chapter as a flood of governmental and technology changes swept over recreational boating.

Tom Bottomley joined the crew working on the book in 1968. It was indeed a crew. There was an exceptional degree of cooperation and dedication between Bill Koelbel and Tom, and between the various outside contributors and the staff at the office. In particular, among the notable support staff was Ruth Smith (Mrs. Harold McCann), who was Mr. Chapman’s famous assistant for four decades.

Tom Bottomley (just like Bill Koelbel) had first been on the editorial staff of MotorBoating magazine. Bottomley’s involvement with “Chapman’s” began in 1968, and he served as the book’s managing editor for a dozen years. His familiarity with every law and regulation passed over the years, and his technical acumen and book production expertise were called upon countless times. This book could not have reached its state of excellence without the benefit of Bottomley’s work.

Mack Maloney, in sheer volume of work as well as its excellence, deserves special singling out. He spent his boyhood in Virginia Beach, Virginia, where his front yard was the Atlantic Ocean. Since then he has never been far from salt water, even during his 28 years in the Marine Corps. By the time Chap was preparing to retire, Mack had already written a number of chapters in the book and was recognized as an authority on many boating subjects. It was Chap’s personal request that Mack step in for him and take over the principal authorship of the book.

Even in retirement, Chap kept his eyes on the book. In his home, “Bylandorsea,” situated on the Connecticut River near Essex, he welcomed visitors from the staff. He deferred comments, saying “You are closer to it all today,”—but the staff always had in mind keeping up the same standards with the new book that he had set for the original volume sixty years and nearly two million copies ago. He was honored in 1955 by the Ole Evinrude Boating Foundation with a silver bowl bearing engraved “No other man deserves so much from so many of us in the World of Boating.” Mr. Chapman died in Essex on March 21, 1976.

Chap was an avid and highly competent motorboat racer. Over the years, he won many trophies, including the Gold Cup shown above.

Beginning in 1965, Mack Maloney became the man in constant touch with the appropriate agencies in Washington D.C. and the man behind the typewriter and computer keyboard, working with the editors in the planning of each new edition. In 2000, for the 64th edition, Mack was given the opportunity to make broad changes in the book. He extensively reorganized and added chapters to Chapman and rewrote the text from the first to the last page. Many new color photographs and illustrations were added as well.

In 2007, Charles (“Chuck”) B. Husick assumed the responsibility for preparing and editing Chapman’s 66th edition. Husick had served on the BoatUS Advisory Council, the American Boat & Yacht Council, the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) Implementation Task Force, and the Radio Technical Committee for Marine Services (RTCM). He was also a journalist who had written about marine engines, electrical systems, communications, and radar for many boating publications and was a contributing editor for others. An avid sailor for more than 40 years and an experienced executive in the marine, aviation, and electronics industries, Husick brought his respect for age-old seamanship and enthusiasm for technology to the tradition of Chapman in the 66th edition.

Chuck passed away after preparing the 66th edition, but a highly qualified team came together to assemble the 67th edition, once again anchored by Mack Maloney, the indispensable constant in the Chapman tradition for 48 years. Mack passed away in early 2014 at the age of 94 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. The editorial team for this 69th edition includes one member (Jonathan Eaton) who worked closely with Mack on the 67th edition and two members (John Wooldridge and John Whiting) who contributed to the 68th edition and have read and consulted Chapman throughout their careers on the water.

Chapman Piloting & Seamanship has passed its three millionth copy sold and is now in its second century of continuous publication. It is somewhat astonishing to realize that the book has had only a handful of principal authors, four publishers, and just two publishing companies in all those years. This famous book remains in its rightful place as the indispensable “Bible of Boating.”

NAUTICAL TERMS

The Language of Boating • The Words That Describe the Vessels, Their Construction, Equipment & Operation • The Terminology That Will Help You Have a Safer, More Enjoyable Time on the Water

Welcome to the Wonderful World of Boating. Whether sail or power, yacht or small boat, cruising, fishing, or just “getting out on the water”—whatever is your style of recreational boating—it can be safer and more enjoyable when done with knowledge. The foundation of any knowledge is built on understanding the special words and phrases of the subject—and so we begin this book.

The language of boats and boating is different from that of the land and landsmen. It has been developed over centuries of use by those who travel the waters, yet is flavored by terms invented in recent memory. When you speak of the “stern” of a boat you are using a word that goes back centuries through several languages; yet when you say that you have a “stern-drive” engine, you are using a term that has been in existence only a relatively short time.

A boater needn’t be excessively “salty” in his speech, but there are strong reasons for knowing and using the right terms for objects and activities around boats. In times of emergency, many seconds of valuable time may be saved when correct, precise terms are used for needed actions or equipment. In correspondence and other written material, use of the right word often shortens long explanations and eliminates doubt or confusion.

Learning and using proper nautical terms will mark you as one who is truly interested in boating. Above all, forming the habit of thinking directly in nautical terms, not in “shore” terms with mental translation, will help you use the proper words consistently. Soon you will find them coming naturally.

The terms discussed in this chapter are not all-inclusive for the field of boating. No two “experts” would agree on what constitutes a “complete” list, and any such list would far exceed the space available here. What follows is intended as a basic nautical vocabulary to prepare you for the various topics presented in detail in succeeding chapters. Many terms will be covered more fully later in the book, and more specialized words and phrases will be introduced at that time. Terms in this chapter will be described in simple, brief remarks rather than comprehensively defined as in dictionaries. Nautical glossaries are available from marine bookstores for those who prefer exhaustive definitions; a Glossary of Selected Terms, Appendix F, is also provided at the end of this book.

## BASIC TERMS

Some terms apply to all sizes and types of waterborne vessels; others apply to smaller craft. Many have found their way into everyday language on shore, such as “making headway” to indicate that progress is being made on a task or project.

#### What Is a Boat?

The term boat has no single definition but generally connotes a waterborne vehicle smaller than a ship. Archaically, a boat was thought of solely as a small craft, such as a lifeboat, carried on board a ship. For purposes of the Navigation Rules, a boat is considered as being no more than 20 meters (65 feet) in length; see Chapters 4 and 5. Other maritime regulations classify a vessel as a boat on the basis of its use, not its size; see this page for more on this.

The terms craft or small craft are often used interchangeably with “boat.”

Vessel is a broad term for all waterborne vehicles and is used without reference to size, particularly in maritime laws and regulations. A yacht is a power or sail vessel used for recreation, as opposed to work. The term often connotes luxurious accommodations, and it is usually not used for craft under 40 feet (12.2 m) in length, but there are no formally established limits. A newer term, megayacht, is now being used for yachts 80 feet (24 m) or more in length, while superyacht is used for those longer than 150 feet (46 m). Although more and more people refer to boats with the neuter pronoun “it,” the traditional “she” is also correct in speaking or writing about almost any type of vessel. Both words are used throughout this book to refer to boats and other vessels.

Figure 1-02 Sailboats get their propulsion from the force of the wind on their sails. They may also have auxiliary engine power for use in calms or for close-quarters maneuvering.

#### Categories of Boats

Boats may be subdivided into powerboats, sailboats, and rowboats as determined by their basic means of propulsion; motorboat is a term used interchangeably with powerboat; these may have gasoline, diesel, or even electric engines or hybrid systems. Sailboats with auxiliary engines are often called auxiliaries, and are legally considered to be motorboats when propelled either by engine alone or by both engine and sails simultaneously. A motorsailer is a boat in which sails are used, but their area is reduced and the engine power is increased; these are somewhat less efficient under sail than sailboats and slower under power than motorboats. Some pure motorboats, such as the popular trawler type, have one or more steadying sails; this is not for propulsion but rather for an easier ride in rough seas or at anchor. Within the broad paddleboat category are such craft as canoes and kayaks.

Figure 1-03 A motorsailer is a sailboat that has a larger engine than the typical auxiliary; it can take advantage of both sail and powered propulsion, but with some sacrifice of efficiency in both modes.

The term cruiser indicates a type of boat with at least minimum accommodations and facilities for overnight trips. The type of propulsion may be added to form such terms as outboard cruiser or inboard cruiser. The term is also applied to many sailboats to distinguish them from others designed primarily for racing or daysailing. Houseboats include both cruising craft whose superstructure is larger and designed more for living aboard, and many smaller vessels that appear to have evolved from land trailers and mobile homes. Houseboats offer more living space than cruisers do, but at some sacrifice of seaworthiness and rough-water cruising ability.

A dinghy (often contracted to “dink”) is a small open boat carried on or towed by a larger craft; it may be propelled by oars, sails, or an outboard motor. A tender is a dinghy or a larger launch used to carry persons and supplies to and from large vessels. A pram is a small, square-bow vessel often carrying a single sail.

Hydrofoil boats move on below-hull structures called foils that are scientifically designed to give lift, much like the wings of an airplane, when moving through the water at high speeds. The lift force developed by the foils can be sufficient to raise the boat’s hull clear of the water, significantly reducing drag and thus increasing speed.

A sailboard is basically a large surfboard with a mast and small sail. The sail is partially supported by the person standing on board, who steers by shifting the positions of the sail and his or her weight on the board; see Figure 1-04.

Figure 1-04 Windsurfing on a sailboard is popular among the young and fit. Skilled sailors can reach 20- to 30-knot speeds in moderate winds.

Most boats have only a single main body or hull, but others may have two or three, and are known collectively as multihulls. Among these latter types are catamarans with two hulls, which may be identical or mirror images of each other; see Figure 1-05. Trimarans have three hulls; a larger center one and two smaller outer hulls. Originally, almost all multihulls were sailing craft, but recent years have seen an increasing interest in power catamarans in a wide range of sizes.

Figure 1-05 Boats, power or sail, with two hulls are called catamarans. They have additional stability and a good measure of speed. Craft with three hulls—the center one usually much larger than the outer ones—are termed trimarans.

Inflatable boats are usually associated with tenders of less than 10 feet (3 m), but they can be much larger. Inflatables of 25 feet (7.6 m) or longer are occasionally seen. A major advantage of inflatables as tenders is that they can be deflated and stowed in a small space. In this mode they often double as life rafts, though they lack many of the protective features that are associated with a proper life raft (Chapter 3).

Inflatables provide greater capacity and more stability than conventional tenders of similar length. Their soft inflated tubes spare the finish of the main hull when the tender is alongside. Unfortunately, they can be difficult (if not impossible) to row under windy or choppy conditions, so are usually powered with a small outboard motor.

Primary considerations with inflatables are the quality of the fabric and gluing process used in their construction. High-quality fabrics that resist abrasion and sunlight and high-strength seams are expensive; consequently, more durable boats are more costly than ordinary inflatables of similar size. For safety, any inflatable should have two or more separate air chambers. If damage causes one to deflate, the undamaged chamber or chambers will keep the boat afloat.

Inflatable and conventional boat construction are combined in what is called a rigid inflatable boat (RIB) or rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB). RIBs are built with a two-part hull, the lower closely resembling the bottom of a high-speed fiberglass powerboat and the upper consisting of inflated tubes. This gives RIBs both the efficient, high-speed performance of a conventional powerboat and the great stability of an inflatable; see Figure 1-06. Such craft can be rowed with much greater ease and success than “soft” inflatables. Many RIBs are purchased not as tenders but as primary boats.

Figure 1-06 Inflatable boats with rigid hulls, often called RIBs, are used both as dinghies and as sportboats. They combine the benefits of a conventional hull with the flotation and stability characteristics of an inflatable.

Personal watercraft, usually referred to as PWCs, have become widely popular both for owners and as rental boats. There are numerous definitions of the term, all of which vary slightly but do not seriously conflict. The PWC Industry Association coined the term and defined it as “an inboard vessel; less than 4 meters (13 ft) in length that uses an internal combustion engine powering a water jet pump as its primary source of propulsion, and is designed with no open load-carrying area that would retain water”; see Figure 1-07. “The vessel is designed to be operated by a person or persons positioned on, rather than within, the confines of the hull.” (Organizations of manufacturers and users of canoes and kayaks are disputing this definition, claiming that their boats are also “personal watercraft.”) A PWC might be considered a motorcycle on the water—the operator sits astride or stands and controls the craft using a handlebar with a throttle on one of the grips. Many models can carry one or two additional persons seated behind the operator. They are often referred to by the brand names of the principal manufacturers—Jet Ski, Wave Runner, or Sea-Doo. It is important to note that PWCs are “vessels,” and must be registered similarly to other boats and are subject to all the same equipment requirements, navigation rules, etc., as other boats. They can be operated legally only between sunrise and sunset as they are not equipped with navigation lights.

Figure 1-07 A personal watercraft, usually called just a PWC, is much like a motorcycle on the water—the operator “rides” the PWC by standing or sitting behind a set of handlebars with a throttle grip. PWCs are, however, a “vessel” and must comply with all navigation rules and other regulations relating to boats.

Jet boats are a development from PWCs. Similarly propelled by a water jet, they are larger, usually with seating for about four persons; those on board sit inside the hull and remain dry. They are usually fitted with navigation lights that allow their use after dark.

A Jet drive is a form of water-powered propulsion found more and more often in larger powerboats.

#### Boaters & Yachtsmen

The owner-operators of recreational small craft, whether male or female, can be referred to as boaters. He or she also may be called, informally, the skipper or captain; the usual legal term is “operator.” The designation of yachtsman is typically reserved for owners of larger craft. Others on board are crew if they participate in the operation of the craft, or guests if they are not so involved.

All persons on a boat are referred to as being on board; the term aboard is less correct.

### Directions on Board a Boat

The bow is sometimes the front end of a boat and sometimes the entire forward section without specific limits; the context in which the term is used will tell you which is meant. Similarly, the stern is either the back end of the boat or its entire back section. The middle section of the boat, between the bow and stern sections, is called midships. Port and starboard (pronounced “starb’d”) are lateral terms. The port side of the boat is to your left and the starboard side is to your right when you’re on the vessel and facing the bow or, to express it differently, when you’re facing forward. If you turn around to face the stern, you will be facing aft, and the boat’s port side will now be to your right.

The bow is the forward part of the boat; the stern is the after part. When one point is aft of another, it is said to be abaft it; when nearer the bow, it is forward of the other. When an object lies on a line—or in a plane—parallel with the centerline of the vessel, it is referred to as lying fore-and-aft, as distinguished from athwartships, which means at right angles to the centerline.

The term amidships has a double meaning. In one sense, it refers to an object or area midway between the boat’s sides. In another sense, it relates to something midway between the bow and the stern. Inboard and outboard, as directional terms, draw a distinction between objects near or toward amidships (inboard) and those away from the centerline or beyond the sides of the craft (outboard).

Someone or something that is abovedeck is not literally above but is rather on the deck as opposed to being below or in the cabin. Any location over the heads of observers who are abovedeck is said to be aloft and must be in the rigging or sails if it’s on the boat.

##### ORIENTING YOURSELF ON BOARD

Life afloat is always oriented to the boat, and not to the people on board. The port side, for instance, is on your left when you’re facing forward and on your right when you’re facing aft, but it’s always the port side, and the other side (to your right when you’re facing forward) is always starboard.

Anything toward the bow is forward, while anything toward the stern is aft. A position aft of an object is abaft of it. (A landmark may be said to be “abaft the beam.”) Something is abeam when it lies off either side of the boat at right angles to the keel.

Any part of the vessel or its equipment that runs from side to side—such as seats or a swim platform—is said to lie athwartships. Anything that runs along or parallel with the vessel’s centerline is said to lie fore-and-aft.

Anything in the middle of the boat is amidships, whether it’s oriented fore-and-aft or athwartships. Inboard is toward the center, outboard away from it. Someone is going below when he or she moves from the deck to a lower cabin inside the hull. The reverse is going above (decks). The term aloft is used for climbing the rigging and masts.

These terms relate to the hull and directions on board a boat. Note that length overall (LOA) is figured similarly for sailboats. Refer to Chapter 8 for terms specific to sailboats.

### Terms Relating to the Boat

The basic part of a boat is its hull. There is normally a major central structural member called the keel; beyond this, however, the components will vary with the construction materials and techniques. Boats may be of the open type or may be covered with a deck. As boats get above the smallest sizes, they may have a superstructure above the main deck level, variously referred to as a deckhouse or cabin (the term “cabin” is also used for spaces below the level of the deck). Small, relatively open boats may have only a shelter cabin, or cuddy, amidships or forward.

A vessel floats because water exerts a buoyant force on it. This force exactly equals the weight of the water that is displaced by the hull. In order to float, the vessel must weigh no more than the water it displaces. If the boat should weigh more, the buoyant force would be inadequate, and it would sink.

Since salt water is heavier and more dense than fresh water, a hull will displace a smaller volume of salt water, and its draft—the distance vertically from the water surface to the lowest point on the boat—is less. For sailboats and displacement powerboats (see this page), the lowest point is normally the bottom of the keel; on planing motorboats (see this page), however, it is usually the propeller blade tips.

As a boat settles into the water—imagine it being lowered in slings from a crane—it reaches a level of equilibrium where the weight of displaced water matches that of the boat. This level on the hull is the waterline. Just above the waterline, a stripe of contrasting color is often painted on the hull; this is the boot-top. Below the waterline, antifouling paint is usually applied to the hull to reduce the accumulation of marine growth, such as barnacles.

#### Terms Relating to the Hull

Sheer is a term used to designate the curve or sweep of the deck of a vessel as viewed from the side. Sheer is normally gracefully upward, but in some designs it can be downward, resulting in reverse sheer. The side skin of a boat between the waterline and deck is called the topsides; the structural element at the upper edge is the gunwale (pronounced “gun’l”). (Note that “gunwhale” is not the correct spelling.) If the sides are drawn in toward the centerline away from a perpendicular as they go upward, as they often do near the stern of a boat, they are said to have tumblehome. Forward, they are more likely to incline outward to make the bow more buoyant and to keep the deck drier by throwing spray aside; this is flare. When the topsides are carried substantially above the level of the deck, they are called bulwarks, and at the top of the bulwarks is the rail. More common than bulwarks are toe rails, narrow strips placed on top of the gunwale to finish it off and provide some safety for persons on deck. Lifelines are used on larger craft at the edges of the side decks to prevent people from falling overboard. These lines usually consist of wire rope, often plastic-covered, supported above the deck on stanchions. If made of solid material—wood or metal—they are called liferails. Boats may also have waist-high bow rails of rigid tubing for the same safety purpose. A pulpit is a forward extension, usually a heavy structure with rails extending up from it; see Figure 1-08. Bow rail installations on sailboats are also often called pulpits, whether they extend forward of the hull or not. Many sailboats also have stern pulpits, and these are sometimes called pushpits.

Figure 1-08 A rail all the way at the bow is called a bow rail or pulpit. It is an important safety feature on sailboats, and often appears on powerboats as well. It should have adequate strength and be solidly mounted.

Along the sides of the hull there may be protrusions, either molded in or added externally, to protect the topsides from the roughness of piles and pier faces. These rub rails or guards are usually faced with metal strips for their own better protection.

Many hulls are fitted with a spray rail external to the topsides just above the waterline. Such a rail usually extends about halfway aft from the leading edge of the hull, or stem, and deflects downward any spray from the bow wave.

#### Hull Shapes

The lowest portion of the hull below the waterline is termed its bottom. This may have one of three basic cross-sectional shapes—flat, round, or v—or it may be a combination of two shapes, one forward gradually changing to the other toward the stern. There are also more complex shapes such as cathedral hull, deep-v, multi-step, and others; see Figure 1-12.

#### Bows & Sterns

The stem is the extreme leading edge of a hull; on wooden craft it is the major structural member at the bow. The stem of a boat is plumb if it is perpendicular to the waterline, or raked if inclined at an angle. The term overhang describes the projection of the upper part of the bow, or stern, beyond a perpendicular up from the point where the stem or stern intersects the waterline. Eyebolts or ringbolts—to which all kinds of lines, ropes, and blocks may be attached—are frequently fitted through the stems of boats.

The flat area across a stern is called the transom. If, however, the stern is pointed, resembling a conventional bow, there is no transom and the boat is called a double-ender; it can also be said to have a canoe stern. The quarter of a boat is the after portion of its sides, particularly the furthermost aft portion where the topsides meet the transom.

#### Additional Hull-Shape Terms

The lower outer part of the hull where the sides meet the bottom is called the turn of the bilge. If the boat is flat or v-bottomed, the bottom and the sides of the boat meet at a well-defined angle rather than a gradual curve—this is the chine of the boat; see Figure 1-09. The more abrupt the angle of intersection of these planes, the harder the chine. Soft-chine craft have a lesser angle; this term is sometimes applied to round-bottom boats, but this is not correct. Some modern boats are designed with multiple chines (longitudinal steps or strakes) for a softer ride at high speeds in rough water; this is a common feature of deep-v design.

Figure 1-09 A chine—the sharp angle at which the sides of a boat’s hull meet the bottom—provides this deep-V powerboat with better control and a dry ride at planing speeds. One of a pair of trim tabs is also seen in this photo.

Larger round-bottom vessels may be built with bilge keels—secondary external keels at the turn of the bilge, actually fins—which reduce the vessel’s tendency to roll in beam seas.

The significance of the term deadrise can be appreciated by visualizing a cross-section of a hull; see Figure 1-10. If the bottom were flat, extending horizontally from keel to chine, there would be no deadrise. In a V-bottom boat, where the bottom rises from keel to chine, the amount of such rise is the deadrise, usually expressed as an angle, but sometimes as inches per foot. The deadrise of a V-bottom boat is often constant from transom to midships but gets steeper forward for a smoother ride through waves.

Figure 1-10 Hulls with deadrise angles at the transom of 16° to 19° are considered to be modified-V types. Steeper angles, some as high as 24°, are designated as deep-V hulls.

With normal sheer, the deck of a boat, as viewed from the side, slopes up toward the bow, and the stern is at least level with amidships. Flam is that part of the concave flare of the topside just below the deck. If it curves outward sharply, it will both increase deck width and reduce the amount of bow spray that blows aboard. The cutwater is the forward edge of the stem, particularly near the waterline. Stem bands of metal are frequently fitted over the stem for protection from debris in the water, ice, pier edges, etc. The forefoot of a boat is the point where the stem joins the keel.

If the boat has an overhanging stern, this part of the hull is the counter. Her lines aft to the stern are her run; lines forward to the stem are her entrance (or entry). The descriptions fine and clean are often applied to the entrance and run. The term bluff is applied to bows that are broader and blunter than normal.

#### Terms Relating to the Keel & Rudder

The keel is the major longitudinal member of the hull. The rudder is the flat blade at or near the stern that is pivoted about a vertical or near-vertical axis so as to change the direction of travel of the vessel through the water. A boat’s rudder is said to be balanced when a portion of its blade area extends forward of the axis of rotation; see Figure 1-11. Such a rudder is easier to turn. A sternward extension of the keel to protect the rudder and propeller from grounding is a skeg; this term also applies to the downward-projecting fin that protects the propeller on an outboard or sterndrive lower unit.

Figure 1-11 A balanced rudder has a portion of the rudder blade (red area) forward of the axis of the rudder shaft. This offsets much of the force required to turn the rudder to steer the boat.

The upward extension of the rudder through which force is applied to turn the rudder is the rudderpost (or rudderstock). A stuffing box keeps the hull watertight where the rudderpost enters. (A stuffing box is also used where a propeller shaft goes through the hull.) The rudder is linked to and turned by the vessel’s wheel; the connection may be by mechanical linkages, cables, or hydraulic lines. Some vessels may be steered by a tiller—a horizontal arm or lever attached directly to the top of the rudderpost.

Figure 1-12 A flat-bottomed boat is inexpensive to build, but pounds. A round bottom provides a soft ride at displacement speeds but is unsuitable for planing. The deep-V hull is used on high-speed craft; cathedral hulls have good stability.

#### Displacement Hulls

A displacement hull is one that achieves all of its buoyancy (flotation capability) by displacing a volume of water equal in weight to the boat and its load, whether underway or at rest. All cruising sailboats and large, low-speed powerboats (such as trawlers, see this page) take advantage of the low power demands of this type of hull; see Figure 1-13. Little driving force is needed to move one of these boats until hull speed is reached. After this, no reasonable amount of increased power results in any efficient increase in speed. A close approximation of any vessel’s hull speed (in knots, see this page for a definition of knots) can be found by multiplying the square root of its length at the waterline (LWL) in feet by the constant 1.3. For example, a boat with a LWL of 36 feet has a theoretical hull speed of 7.8 knots:  x 1.3 = 6 x 1.3 = 7.8.

Figure 1-13 The force exerted by the wind on the sails creates a heeling effect as well as forward motion.

The need for an easily driven hull is obvious in a sailboat. In a powerboat, a displacement hull allows long-range cruising with a minimal expenditure of fuel. Cruising ranges in hundreds of nautical miles (see this page for an explanation of nautical miles) are not exceptional, especially for a trawler-type boat with a single diesel engine. Another advantage of a displacement hull is the ability to carry heavy loads with little penalty in overall performance.

Displacement hulls are normally round-bottomed. If one is flat-bottomed, it is usually for ease of construction rather than any reason of efficiency.

#### Planing Hulls

A planing hull is one that achieves a major part of its underway-load-carrying ability by the dynamic interaction of its underside with the surface of the water over which it is rapidly traveling; at rest, a planing hull reverts to displacement buoyancy; see Figure 1-14. Planing action greatly reduces drag and wave-making resistance, allowing relatively higher speeds. Nearly all modern motorboats have planing hulls. Small, light sailboats with large sail plans (defined on this page) can reach planing speeds in ideal conditions.

Figure 1-14 Hydrodynamic force lifts a planing hull partially out of the water, reducing drag and wave-making resistance. This makes high speed possible.

A planing hull is characterized by a flat aft run that meets the transom at a sharp angle. This angle allows the water flowing under the hull to “break away” cleanly from the transom. Hydrodynamic forces on the flat aft run lift the boat until only a small portion of its bottom is in the water. Distinct chines aid in speed and directional control as speed increases.

It takes considerable horsepower (hp) to achieve planing speeds, and that means greater fuel consumption. As a result, the cruising range of a planing hull is generally much less than that of a displacement boat carrying the same amount of fuel. Of course, the planing hull gets to its destination a lot sooner!

##### SAILBOAT HULLS

A sailboat needs a hull with a large amount of lateral resistance. Without this resistance it would blow sideways with the wind instead of sailing forward. Small, unballasted sailboats use movable appendages called centerboards, or daggerboards, to provide lateral resistance. A centerboard is hinged and swings down out of a centerboard trunk, whereas a daggerboard is raised or lowered vertically and can be completely removed from the boat. Another method of obtaining lateral resistance, now seldom used, is through two leeboards, which look like centerboards attached to the gunwales, one on either side.

Larger sailboats have permanently attached, fixed external keels designed to provide lateral resistance. Older designs have a full keel that starts near the bow and continues aft until it joins the rudder. In recent decades, fin keels and winged keels have become popular because they allow greater maneuverability and improved upwind performance. The rudder of a fin-keel boat may be attached to a small skeg for protection, or it may be a freestanding appendage known as a spade rudder.

A centerboard is raised or lowered in its trunk by a pendant (also called “pennant”) to permit adjustment according to the point of sail or for shallow water.

A full keel is usually found on older, larger boats. It may have internal ballast or exterior ballast bolted onto the hull—which also acts as a grounding shoe.

Both full and fin keels also serve as the craft’s fixed ballast. Modern practice is to form these keels out of lead or cast iron so the ballast is outside and below the hull where it will have the maximum countering effect on heeling. Ballast has no effect until the boat begins to heel. As the angle of heel increases, the ballast exerts an increasing force to right the boat. A ballasted sailboat will typically heel—tip sideways—rather easily at first, and then become “stiffer” as the ballast takes effect. Each sailboat has an angle of heel where the hull achieves maximum performance.

#### V Hulls

Pounding—coming down hard on successive waves—inevitably occurs when any boat is driven through rough water at high speeds. It is accentuated by the broad, flat sections required of an efficient planing hull. Slowing down eliminates the problem, but many planing hulls become much more difficult to maneuver at slow speeds. The need to compromise between planing speeds and sea-keeping qualities has led to the almost universal acceptance of the V hull, a design developed in the 1960s. A steep deadrise provides acceptable wave riding along with sufficient planing ability to achieve high speed. Whether modified-V or deep-V aft of amidships, a V hull’s sections will have steeper deadrise forward to reduce pounding.

Trim tabs are rectangular control flaps that project approximately parallel to the water’s surface at the lower edge of the transom; refer to Figure 1-09. Deep-V and modified-V hulls are very sensitive to trim tab adjustment. Adjusting the tabs down pushes the stern up and the bow down, which helps the hull rise to planing trim. These hulls are also sensitive to small changes in the angle of propeller thrust with an outboard motor or inboard/outboard drive.

#### Semi-planing Hulls

A semi-planing (or semi-displacement) hull is one that gets a significant portion of its weight-carrying capability from dynamic action, but which does not travel at a fast enough speed for full planing status. It is often a hull that is round-bottomed forward, gradually flattening out toward the stern to provide a planing surface.

#### Ballasted Hulls

Whereas listing is tipping caused by improper weight distribution, heeling is the sideways tipping of a boat caused by wind in the sails. A sailboat must be able to resist this force, which acts high above the deck where it has maximum impact on stability. The boat can fight the heeling force with hull shape and ballast (weight put on board specifically for this function). Considering stability, a flat-bottom hull presents immediate and strong resistance to heeling—meaning that it has great initial stability—but will ultimately give up with a sudden capsize, turning bottom up. At the other extreme, a round hull required for efficient sailing offers little initial resistance to heeling but when well designed and ballasted possesses ample ultimate stability, or resistance to capsize. A fine hull (see this page) offers less resistance to heeling than a beamy one (see this page).

On smaller sailboats, the crew can act as “live ballast,” shifting to the windward side to counteract heeling. Some larger sailing craft have ballast tanks on each side of the hull, and water ballast can be pumped from one side to the other to counteract heeling.

#### Deck Terms

A deck is an important horizontal structural part of a boat, its design dictated as much for strength as by aesthetics. If a deck is arched to aid in draining off water, it is said to be cambered. Similarly, camber occurs on the tops of cabins, deckhouses, etc. The deck over the forward part of a vessel, or the forward part of the total deck area, is termed a foredeck. Similarly, the aftdeck (afterdeck) is located in the after part of the vessel. Side decks are exterior walkways from the foredeck aft. Safety demands that all walking areas of exterior decks be treated with nonskid material.

Hatches (sometimes called hatchways) are openings in the deck of a vessel to provide access below. Companion ladders (steps) lead downward from the deck; these also are termed companionways.

Cockpits are open wells in the deck of a boat outside of deckhouses and cabins. The deck of a cockpit, or of an interior cabin, is often called the sole. Coamings are vertical pieces around the edges of the cockpit, hatches, etc., to prevent water on deck from running below.

Figure 1-15 On board sailboats (left) and powerboats (right), the galley is frequently part of the main cabin. There is often an adjacent dinette, the table of which can be lowered to make an additional sleeping berth.

#### Interior Terms

Vertical partitions, corresponding to walls in a house, are called bulkheads. Watertight bulkheads are solid or are equipped with doors that can be secured so tightly as to be leakproof. The interior areas divided off by bulkheads are termed compartments—such as an engine compartment—or cabins—such as the main cabin or aft cabin. Some areas are named by their use; the kitchen aboard a boat is its galley; see Figures 1-15 and 1-16. The toilet area is the head; the same name is also given to the toilet itself, which will be attached to some sort of marine sanitation device (MSD; see this page). The Overhead is the nautical term for what would be the ceiling of a room in a house; if made of soft material, it can be called the headliner. Ceiling, on a boat, is light planking or plywood sheeting on the inside of the frames, along the sides of the boat. Floors, nautically speaking, are not laid to be walked upon, as in a house, but are structural parts adjacent to the keel.

Figure 1-16 This view shows the interior arrangements of a midsize power cruiser with comfortable accommodations for four persons, expandable when needed for two to four more. On this boat, the main saloon is raised above the engines, and the galley is “down.”

The term bilge is also applied to the lower interior areas of the hull of a vessel. Here water that leaks or washes in, or is blown on board as spray, collects as bilge water, to be later pumped overboard by a bilge pump.

Berths and bunks are seagoing names for beds aboard a boat. Closets are termed lockers; a hanging locker is one tall enough for full-length garments; a wet locker is one specifically designated for soggy foul-weather gear (rain jackets and pants). Chests and boxes may also be called lockers. A rope or chain locker is often found in the bow of a boat for stowing the anchor line or chain; this area is called the forepeak. Lazarettes are compartments in the stern of a vessel used for general storage.

When something is put away in its proper place on a vessel, it is stowed. The opposite of stowing, to break out, is to take a needed article from its locker or other secure place.

Helm is a term relating to the steering mechanism of a craft. An individual is at the helm when that person is at the controls of the boat; he is then the helmsman (male or female). The bridge of a vessel is the location from which it is steered and its speed controlled. On small craft, the term control station is perhaps more appropriate. Many motorboats have a flying bridge, an added set of controls above the level of the normal control station for better visibility and more fresh air. These, also called flybridges, are sometimes open, but often have a fixed or a collapsible (“Bimini”) top for shade, and perhaps clear plastic curtains forward, aft, and around the sides for protection from the weather; see Figure 1-17. Medium-size and larger boats, particularly sailboats, may have a specially designated area in a cabin below for a nav station equipped with a chart table.

Figure 1-17 A power cruiser’s flying bridge, usually called a flybridge, is an upper steering position originally intended as a platform to spot game fish.

#### Portholes & Portlights

On a boat, a port (or porthole) is an opening in the hull to admit light and air. The glass used in it to keep the hull weathertight is termed a portlight if it can be opened, and a deadlight if it cannot. Openings in cabins above the deck are generally windows that open by sliding to one side.

#### The Dimensions of a Vessel

The length of a boat is often given in two forms: length overall (LOA) and length at the waterline (LWL), also known as the load waterline; see this page. LOA is measured from the forward part of the stem to the after part of the stern along the centerline, excluding any projections that are not part of the hull, such as a bowsprit or swim platform. A boat with a LOA of 35 feet (10.7 m) might have a total length of 42 feet (12.8 m) when these appendages are taken into consideration. In some powerboats, the swim platform is an integral part of the hull and thus included in any LOA measurements. The waterline of a boat is the plane where the surface of the water touches the hull when it is loaded normally; LWL is measured from stem to stern in a straight line along this plane. The greatest width of a vessel is its beam; boats of greater than normal beam are described as beamy. A vessel’s draft is the depth of water required to float it; it is said to “draw” that depth. Draft should not be confused with the term depth, which is used in connection with large vessels and documented boats and is measured inside the hull from the underside of the deck to the top of the keel. The height of a boat’s topsides from the waterline to the deck is called its freeboard; this is normally greater at the bow than at the stern. Headroom is the vertical distance between the deck and the cabin or canopy top, or any overhead structure.

### Powerboat Types

Powerboat builders use numerous terms to distinguish boat types, and they are not always consistent. However, a few basic terms seem to be universal, surviving changes in style. A runabout usually seats four to six persons. Bowriders have additional seating in the open bow accessed via a walk-through windshield. Neither of these types has formal sleeping accommodations, though seats may fold down for sunning or napping.

On runabouts of about 20 feet (6.1 m) or longer, the space at the bow becomes large enough for a small enclosure or cabin, termed a cuddy (the oft-heard “cuddy cabin” is redundant). While not luxurious, the cuddy does offer shelter in wet weather and may also enclose a portable head.

#### Powerboat Cockpits & Bridges

The central element of a small powerboat is the control console. Controls such as the steering wheel and the throttle and shift levers should be placed within easy reach. There should be good sight lines so that engine instruments and electronic displays are readily viewable. As boat length increases, it becomes both possible and advisable to elevate the helm station for better visibility and give it the traditional name, “bridge.”

Limited space makes it a challenge to install all of the radio communication and navigational electronic equipment on the console in a practical fashion. One common and sometimes overlooked challenge is that of placing the compass in a position from which it can be easily read and is as free as possible from undesired magnetic influences.

At about 30 feet (9.1 m) of overall length, it becomes possible to provide a flybridge. This location for the controls has become popular as it provides better visibility all around the horizon. Sun and weather protection is usually provided by a Bimini top, frequently with all-around curtains.

Many motorboats have dual steering stations, one in the cabin below and one on the flybridge. Steering and engine controls are duplicated, as are some of the electronics. This design allows for a comfortable operating position in any weather.

Powerboats often have swim platforms just aft of the transom that also serve as boarding platforms for dinghies; see Figure 1-21. Some sport-fishing craft will have gates in the transom, and no swim platform, to help in boarding large game fish.

#### Center-consoles & Daycruisers

A center-console boat has its helm and engine controls located on the centerline approximately midway between the bow and stern; see Figure 1-18. These craft are popular with anglers as they have the maximum deck space for a boat’s overall length (LOA). Seating is usually limited to a pair of swivel or bench seats, sometimes with additional seating in the stern. Fishing enthusiasts can handle rods or swing nets around the boat’s entire perimeter. The lack of enclosed space makes this type undesirable for cruising. Center-consoles range in length from less than 15 feet (4.6 m) to 35 feet (10.7 m) or longer.

Figure 1-18 The 24-foot outboard-powered center-console at left is designed as a fishing machine, with open room for anglers to maneuver everywhere in the boat. The 41-foot walk-around at right has a cabin for accommodations and storage, while narrow side decks allow access to the foredeck for fishing.

In the range of 20 feet to 25 feet (6.1 to 7.6 m), daycruisers are large enough to have a small cabin forward with seated headroom. This will probably have a v-berth, a portable head, and a small galley consisting of a tabletop stove and a basin, with a folding table.

#### Express & Sedan Cruisers

Longer than about 25 feet (7.6 m), powerboat styles begin to diverge. Differences in accommodation layout are reflected in differences in their hull and superstructure shapes. Express cruisers form one branch of powerboat design, whereas another is composed of sedan cruisers, sometimes called convertibles; see Figure 1-19.

Figure 1-19 The express cruiser is a modern, sporty design that enlarges the sportboat configuration to include accommodations in the forward cabin and an open raised bridge. It has a planing hull.

An express cruiser takes the basic sportboat or runabout configuration and enlarges it to a length of 40 feet (12.2 m) or more. The craft’s foredeck is long and unobstructed, interrupted only by hatches that provide ventilation to the enclosed space below. The control station, or bridge, is set well aft and often slightly higher than the level of the open cockpit near the stern. A radar arch is sometimes included to provide high and clear mounting space for radar and other antennas. An express cruiser is typically quite stylish and high-powered.

A sedan or convertible cruiser puts the main interior space on the same level as the cockpit. The interior is divided into two parts: a main cabin or saloon at the level of the cockpit and a forward cabin lower and under the foredeck. (“Saloon” is the proper nautical word, although “salon” will be seen in some advertising literature.) Smaller sedans usually will have their galleys within the main cabin; this is known as a galley up layout. The galley down layout has the galley between the saloon and the forward cabin, at the level of the latter.

#### Aft-cabin Cruisers

As length increases, it becomes possible to have sleeping quarters below the level of the deck at the stern in an aft cabin. The engines are moved forward to the middle area of the hull beneath the main cabin, and the resulting design is called a double-cabin cruiser. (If the boat is large enough, there may be a second sleeping cabin aft, and the design becomes a tri-cabin or triple-cabin cruiser.)

#### Sport Fishermen

A sport-fishing boat can be a convertible or sedan that is rigged for fishing, or it can be a true sport fisherman (sometimes colloquially called a “sportfish”) with a longer foredeck, shortened main cabin, and much larger cockpit aft. Purpose-designed game-fishing craft usually have a tuna tower with a set of controls at a maximum height for better fish spotting; some have a control station in the cockpit for boat handling during the final fighting and boarding of game fish. The boat will have outriggers for additional trolling lines and the cockpit will be outfitted with special fighting chairs.

#### Recreational Trawlers

Within the commercial fishing community, the word “trawler” has a specific meaning relating to a style of fishing, but in recreational boating the term is used much more loosely. In general, a cruiser that does not have sufficient horsepower to get into a planing mode is known as a trawler.

The trawler’s displacement hull is designed to ride through and not over the water; see Figure 1-20. It can vary from one with soft bilges to one with hard chines. Nearly all trawlers have a significant external keel. Speed is normally limited to hull speed; power is provided by a single or twin engines. These craft have very modest fuel consumption characteristics and are popular for traveling at speeds of 7 to 10 knots over long distances. Some trawler-style cruisers are designed with semi-planing hulls and outfitted with high-horsepower diesel engines that offer improved fuel efficiency at displacement speeds and shorter transit times at higher speeds.

Figure 1-20 A trawler was originally designed as a low-speed, seaworthy commercial fishing vessel. As a recreational boat, trawlers are fuel-efficient and offer many onboard living advantages.

Figure 1-21 A swim platform allows easier entry into and exit from the water or a dinghy; it can also be very helpful in a man-overboard situation. Be sure the engine is shut off when people are in the water near the boat. If the platform is integral with the hull, as here, it is included in the boat’s overall length.

### Sailboat Types

Sailboats are seldom identified as to their cabin layouts as are powerboats, probably because less variety is possible. Instead, sailing craft are usually known by their sail plans: the number of masts and the position of their sails (described on this page and this page). Smaller sailboats almost always have a cockpit at or near the stern. Interior accommodations are forward in one or more cabins. While interior space receives the most attention from new boat buyers, it is actually the cockpit where most sailors’ time is spent; see Figure 1-22.

Many larger sailboats are of the center-cockpit style, in contrast with the aft-cockpit layout shown in Figure 1-22. With sufficient beam at the stern and the cockpit more nearly amidships, it becomes possible to have an adequate aft cabin behind or partially under the cockpit. To retain useful space below, however, it is necessary to raise the cockpit sole to the level of the deck, and the result is ungainly in center-cockpit boats of less than about 40 feet (12.2 m) in length.

Figure 1-22 Interior layouts for sailboats vary widely depending on the length and beam of the craft. This midsize cruising sailboat offers accommodations for several crew and guests.

As sailcloth, rigging wire, and metal masts have improved in strength, taller masts have become possible without increasing weight. Greater height allows more sail area or the same area in a more efficient shape. Reduction in rigging weight, more stable hulls, and better deck equipment have made possible simpler sail plans.

##### SAIL PLANS FOR VARIOUS RIGS

###### THE SLOOP

The most popular plan is the sloop, which has one mast forward of amidships and two sails. The forward sail is the headsail or jib, and the aft one is the mainsail, also called the main. A sail’s leading edge is its luff; its after edge is the leech and its bottom edge is the foot. The jib is attached to the headstay with hanks, strong hooks with spring-loaded closures. An alternative design uses a semi-flexible track, or foil, on the stay that accepts a boltrope sewn along the sail’s luff. Such tracks offer better air-flow over the luff, making the sail more efficient; this also allows roller furling to reduce sail area in heavy weather. Some mainsails may be roller-furled into a slot in the mast or boom, making them easier to reef; refer also to Figure 1-23 and Chapter 8.

Headsails can have many names, depending on their size, weight, and shape. A storm jib is a small sail made of heavy cloth to be flown in heavy weather; a working jib is flown in a moderate to fresh breeze; and a genoa, an oversize jib reaching well past the mast and built from lighter sailcloth, provides greater power when the wind is light. Genoas come in a range of sizes, the larger of which may have a surface area greater than the mainsail. As roller-furling mechanisms have become more reliable and versatile, a single roller-furling headsail—the size of a large genoa when fully set and the size of a working jib when partially furled—is an increasingly popular substitute for a range of headsails that must be raised and lowered as the wind strengthens or lightens. This approach trades a slight loss of aerodynamic efficiency for a large increase in convenience.

When a sloop’s jib is hoisted from a stay running to the top of the mast, it is a masthead sloop. If the jib is hoisted to a lower point, the sloop has a fractional rig. The headsail of this type of rig only reaches to a fraction of the height of the mast—typically three-quarters or seven-eighths.

The foot of a working jib may be attached to a small spar called a club. This arrangement allows the sail to be self-tending because it can be controlled by one sheet rather than two. A club-footed jib can be tacked (see Chapter 8) without releasing one sheet and hauling in on the other. Self-tending jibs are easier to handle but limited to working-jib size. Genoas, which overlap the mainmast, cannot be controlled with a club and single sheet.

###### THE CUTTER

A single-masted sailboat similar to the sloop, the cutter has its mast more nearly amidships, leaving room for a larger fore-triangle filled by two headsails. The outer headsail is the jib, while the inner is a staysail. A cutter rig has two advantages. First, it divides sail area among smaller sails that are more easily handled. Second, it provides more sail reduction options in rough going than does a sloop. And when the jib is lowered, the remaining staysail is smaller and closer to the mast, giving added safety in a seaway. This rig has been a longtime favorite among cruising sailors. A modern double headsail sloop—essentially a cutter with its mast slightly farther forward—accomplishes much the same thing.

###### THE KETCH & YAWL

The ketch and yawl look somewhat alike. Both have a tall mainmast and a shorter mizzenmast (a smaller mast aft of the mainmast) that flies a mizzen sail. The distinction between a ketch and a yawl is a common topic of debate among sailors. Traditionally, the governing rule is the location of the mizzenmast: If it is ahead of the rudderpost, the boat is a ketch; however, if it is behind the rudderpost, the boat is a yawl.

Ketches and yawls are divided rigs, meaning the sail area is divided between two masts. Either craft may have a masthead or a fractional rig forward of the mainmast with one or more headsails. Individual sails are more manageable in size and more easily handled by a small crew. Both may fly a large jib-like sail between the masts called a mizzen staysail. Because of the extra rigging and mast surface area exposed to the wind, these rigs have more windage and are less effective on smaller boats where windage is relatively more important. Ketch rigs—which are more versatile than yawls by virtue of their larger and more powerful mizzens—are popular among cruising sailors for long-distance voyages. Mizzenmasts are a practical location for mounting electronic antennas.

###### THE SCHOONER

A schooner is a vessel with at least two masts (in the 19th century, some carried up to seven). On two-masted schooners, the mainmast is aft, and is at least as tall or taller than the forward mast, or foremast. Most schooners used multiple headsail combinations including—from top down—the flying jib, the jib, and the forestaysail. The number of headsails and their names vary with the location and the time period.

Schooners were workboats, mainly fishing vessels. Equipped with tall, powerful rigs, they raced home from the Grand Banks (southeast of Newfoundland) to get top dollar for their catches.

Early schooners were gaff rigged with four-sided (four-edged) sails on the mainmast and foremast supported by a spar—the gaff—at their top edges. Often, a triangular topsail was flown above both the main and foresails. For extra power, a sail called a fisherman was set between the masts. These complex rigs required more deck hands than are standard today. The modern schooner rig may carry a Marconi or jib-headed main and foresail (triangular as in the mainsail on a sloop). The foresail may be loose-footed, not fitted with a boom, and there may be only one headsail.

Schooners are most comfortable in steady trade winds on long ocean passages. Although they do not sail to windward as well as other rigs, they make up for it when the wind is on or aft of the beam.

###### THE CAT/BOAT

A boat that caries only one mast set well forward and no headsails is known as a catboat. When fishing was done under sail, catboats were practical for coastal fishermen because there was less rigging to get in the way when handling nets or unloading the catch. Also, the boat’s single sail was easier for one person to handle.

Recent cat-rigged designs make use of unstayed masts (masts that have no standing rigging, being supported only by the deck). With less windage, and high, narrow sail plans, these can often perform nearly as well as sloop rigs. Today you can see unstayed cat ketches and the occasional cat schooner.

#### Sailing Rigs

Rig is the general term applied to the arrangement of a vessel’s masts and sails. Most recreational sailing craft are now fitted with triangular-shaped sails and are said to be Marconi-rigged (or jib-headed). If a four-sided sail with a gaff is used, the boat is described as gaff-rigged.

The principal sail of a boat is its mainsail. A sail forward of the mast—or ahead of the most forward mast if there is more than one—is a headsail; a single headsail is usually termed a jib.

If a boat has no headsails, it is a catboat; she may be either Marconi-rigged or gaff-rigged. A boat having a single mast, with a mainsail and a jib, is a sloop. On some boats additional headsails are set from a bowsprit, a spar projecting forward over the bow. (See Chapter 8 for more information on masts and spars.)

A modern cutter is a variation of the sloop rig in which the mast is stepped further aft, resulting in a larger area for headsails. A cutter normally sets two headsails—a forestaysail with a jib ahead of it.

Yawls have two masts, the after one of which is much smaller and is stepped abaft the rudderpost. A ketch likewise has two masts with the after one smaller, but here the difference in height is not so marked and the after mast is stepped forward of the rudderpost. The taller mast is the mainmast; the shorter mast of either rig is the mizzenmast, and the after sail is the mizzen.

Schooners have two or more masts, but unlike yawls and ketches the after mast of a two-masted schooner is taller than the forward one (in some designs, the two masts may be the same height). Thus the after mast becomes the mainmast and the other the foremast. Additional names are used if there are more than two masts.

Figure 1-23 When the wind blows too strongly for safety or comfort, it is time to reduce the sail area by reefing the mainsail and/or genoa or switching to a smaller headsail as described in Chapter 8.

#### Square-Rigged Vessels

Vessels on which the principal sails are set generally athwartships are referred to as square-rigged. These four-sided (four edged) sails are hung from horizontal spars known as yards. Headsails are carried, as on other rigs, forward of the foremost mast. Staysails may also be set between the masts, and the aftermost mast of a square-rigged vessel normally carries a fore-and-aft sail. Very limited use is made of this rig for recreational sailing vessels.

#### Sailboat Cockpits

Because the cockpit of a cruising sailboat serves as both social gathering place and a control center, compromises must be made between access to halyards and sheets (lines to hoist and trim sails) or to winches (devices to increase the pull on such lines) and the comfort of those on board; see Figure 1-24. Typical cockpits have facing bench seats on each side that are close enough together that individuals can brace themselves as the boat heels. Cockpit seats often lift open to reveal seat lockers—stowage for sail bags, an uninflated life raft, dock lines, sheets, winch handles, and the accumulated etceteras of life afloat.

Figure 1-24 A winch revolves clockwise only, resisting the strain of sheets and providing extra power for trimming sails. Self-tailing winches, as shown here, allow one person to do the work of two.

A pedestal with steering wheel may stand near the aft end of the cockpit. On top of this may be a binnacle, a case that houses a compass (refer to Chapter 13). The pedestal may also support shift and throttle levers for an auxiliary engine. On smaller sailboats, there may be no pedestal, with steering being accomplished using a tiller.

Connecting the sailboat cockpit to the main cabin below is a companionway consisting of a steep set of ladder-like steps, a grab rail, and a sliding hatch. The part of the cockpit that must be stepped over at the top of the companionway is called a bridge deck, an important safety feature. If the cockpit were to fill with water from a large wave, this barrier would prevent it from flooding the interior. Daysailers and inshore cruising sailboats don’t need bridge decks, but a seagoing sailboat should have one.

Water in the cockpit drains through at least two scuppers (drain holes) leading from the lowest points on the cockpit sole through the hull. The cockpit sole must be above the waterline at any angle of heel for these drains to work.

Aft of the cockpit there is often a lazarette, accessed through a hatch. In some more recent designs, there may be a set of steps leading down to a swim platform just above the water. This platform, in addition to being used for getting into and out of the water for swimming, is useful for boarding or disembarking from a dinghy; it can also be helpful in retrieving a person from the water in a man-overboard (MOB) situation.

### Construction Terms

The term fastening is applied to various screws, bolts, or specially designed nails that hold equipment and other gear to the hull or superstructure. Through fastenings are bolts that go all the way through the hull or other base timbers, secured with a washer and nut on the inside; a backing block is generally advisable for spreading the stress and to gain additional strength. Bedding compound, a sealer and adhesive, should be used between any fitting and the surface on which it is mounted.

Sea cocks are valves installed just inside through-hull fittings where water is taken in or discharged for engine cooling, operation of heads, etc. Sea cocks are important safety devices as they can shut off the flow of water if a hose breaks or a piece of equipment must be worked on.

Areas that are varnished to a high gloss are termed brightwork. (In naval usage, this term may be applied to polished brass.) A tack rag is a slightly sticky cloth that is wiped over surfaces that are to be varnished or painted just before the brush is applied, to remove all dust and grit.

When the rudder of a boat is exactly centered, one spoke of the steering wheel should be vertical; this is the king spoke and is usually marked with special carving or wrapping so that it can be recognized by feel alone. (The wheel of a hydraulic steering system may not have an unvarying center position.) Some craft will have on the instrument panel an electrical rudder angle indicator.

Many motorboats are constructed with a small signal mast from which flags can be flown. These flags are hoisted on signal halyards. When partially hoisted on any mast, flags are said to be at the dip; when fully hoisted, they are termed two-blocked.

Vessels, including boats, are normally designed by a naval architect. In doing so, he or she prepares detailed plans and specifications, including the lines (shape) of her hull. Clean is a term applied not to a boat’s condition, but rather to her lines. If the lines are fine, so that she slips easily through the water, the lines are said to be clean.

A marine surveyor is a highly experienced person whose job it is to make detailed inspections (surveys) of boats and ships to determine the condition of hull, equipment, machinery, etc.; see Figure 1-25.

Figure 1-25 Generally, a survey is conducted when the boat is out of the water. A marine surveyor gives the person who has commissioned the survey an extensive report on all structural elements of the boat, including suggestions regarding needed repairs.

#### Fiberglass Construction

There are some recreational boats still in use that are of wood construction, and a few are still built each year. While there are dedicated wooden-boat enthusiasts and popular publications targeted for them, the majority of recreational boats are made of fiberglass. The full name of this material is “fiber-reinforced plastic,” which properly describes the material as glass fibers embedded in a thermosetting plastic, usually polyester or vinylester but sometimes epoxy (stronger, but more expensive). In recent years glass has sometimes been replaced with Kevlar or carbon fiber. Large yachts are often made of aluminum or with steel hulls and aluminum superstructures.

There are many advantages to fiberglass construction; see Figure 1-26. Surfaces can be of any desired compound curvature; multiple identical hulls, superstructures, and lesser components can be made economically from reusable molds; and plastic hulls completely resist attack by marine organisms, although they do require antifouling paint if kept in salt water for long periods.

Figure 1-26 Fiberglass construction allows multiple hulls, superstructures, and other components to be made economically from reusable molds. Surfaces can be of any desired compound curvature.

Fiberglass construction uses a female mold into which multiple layers are placed. Each layer is laid up in turn following a mold schedule, or list of layers. Typically, this might consist of a gel coat (the outer skin of the hull), followed by a layer of mat or chopped strands of fiberglass to ensure that the weave of subsequent layers of roving material does not show through the gel coat. The layers of roving (a coarse, heavy weave) might be followed by core material (see below) and further interior layers. A special layer, called an osmosis barrier, is usually placed just under the gel coat to prevent the movement of water through the gel coat that could eventually cause blisters. More modern, sophisticated and expensive building methods include vacuum bagging, where layers of fiberglass and other composites are impregnated with resin and enclosed in an airtight plastic bag. A powerful vacuum then compresses the entire laminate, minimizing structural voids and ensuring a high fiber-to-resin ratio for a lighter, stronger vessel.

Molded construction is also used for one-off, high-performance racing boats—both power and sail. While the methods used are similar to production boats, these often make use of better (more expensive) materials, such as unidirectional, biaxial, or even more specialized glass cloths. Epoxy resins frequently replace the polyesters used in more conventional boats, and Kevlar, carbon fiber, and other strong, light, expensive reinforcing materials may replace ordinary fiberglass in critical areas or throughout the boat.

Secondary parts of the boat are laid-up in their own molds, usually with a simpler schedule than is used for the hull. These parts are removed from their molds, fitted with various hardware and other components (cleats, hatches, rails tanks, electrical wiring harnesses, etc.), then assembled to complete the craft.

Fiberglass is strong but heavy, and not very stiff. Sufficient stiffness can be achieved without undesired weight by using cored construction, also called composite construction. Two layers of fiberglass are separated by a light but compression-resistant core, typically a rigid foam or balsawood. Stiffening can also be achieved by the use of box-like sections, called high-hat sections, which form a grid or run longitudinally inside the hull or under a deck.

The principal engineering problem, once the molding is complete, is how best to attach the deck to the hull. Theories abound, but in general the best hull-deck joints offer large surfaces for bedding compound or other sealers and adhesives; see Figure 1-27. Thick wood or metal backing plates for through-bolt attachments are also requirements. Finally, there must be provisions for rub rails and stanchion bases.

Figure 1-27 Hull-deck joints must be rigid and watertight. Most are molded box-sections that are liberally caulked with permanent adhesive sealants. Stainless steel through-bolts provide additional security. The hull-deck joint shown above is typical of a small powerboat.

Fiberglass is useful also in covering wood, either in new construction or in the repair of older boats, where its properties of adhesion are important.

#### Sailboat Masts & Spars

While carbon fiber is also used in the construction of sophisticated racing sailboat masts, the majority of modern sailing craft have spars that are made of extruded aluminum alloy. Most masts and booms are simple tubes. Where more efficient shapes are required, they can be fabricated by cutting and rewelding basic extrusions.

Aluminum is strong, so mast failures are rare except on hard-pressed racing boats. Its main advantage is the material’s light weight, which keeps the boat’s center of gravity low and improves sailing performance.

### Terms Relating to Equipment

Chocks are deck fittings, usually of metal, with inward curving arms through which mooring, anchor, or other lines are passed to lead them in the proper direction both on and off the boat; they should be very smooth to prevent excess wearing of the line. Cleats are fittings of metal or wood with outward curving arms, called horns, on which lines can be fastened; see Figure 1-28.

Figure 1-28 Cleats, chocks, and bitts (clockwise from top left) are used on both powerboats and sailboats. Their shape and size may vary with the size of the craft.

While cleats are generally satisfactory for most purposes on a boat, wooden or metal bitts are recommended if heavy strains are to be made. These are stout vertical posts, either single or double. They may take the form of a fitting securely bolted (never screwed) to the deck, but even better—as in the case of a samson post—passing through the deck and stepped at the keel or otherwise strongly fastened. Sometimes a round metal pin, called a norman pin, is fitted horizontally through the head of a post or bitt to aid in belaying the line; see Figure 1-29.

Figure 1-29 A sampson post, a strong fitting on the foredeck, secures the anchor rode or dock lines. The norman pin, which passes through it, keeps the line from slipping up and off the post, and provides a means of securing the line with half hitches.

Where lines pass through a chock, or rub against a surface, they should be protected from wear by a chafe guard; see Figure 1-30.

Figure 1-30 Chafe guards should be used on any lines that pass over an abrasive surface. They may be a purchased item, as shown above, but can be homemade by using a split garden hose or special tape applied to the lining.

Fenders are relatively soft objects of rubber or plastic used between boats and piles, pier sides, seawalls, etc., to protect the topsides from scarring and to cushion any shock of the boat striking a fixed object; see Figure 1-31. Fenders (sometimes referred to in a landlubberly fashion as “bumpers”) are also used between boats when they are tied, or rafted, together. Fender boards are short lengths of stout planking, often with cushion material or metal rubbing strips on one side. They are normally used horizontally with two fenders hung vertically behind them to provide a wider bearing surface against a single pile.

Figure 1-31 A fender is used to protect the side of a boat from damage by a rough pile or pier face. It also cushions any shocks to the boat from waves or the wake of passing vessels. Fenders can be hung horizontally or vertically as required by the surface they bear upon.

Life preservers—also called personal flotation devices, abbreviated PFD—provide additional buoyancy to keep people afloat when in the water. They take the form of cushions, belts, vests, jackets, inflatables, and ring buoys. PFDs must be of a USCG–approved type to meet the legal requirements as set forth in Chapter 3.

A boat hook is a short shaft of wood or metal with a hook fitting at one end shaped to aid in extending one’s effective reach from the side of the boat, such as when putting a line over a pile or picking up an object dropped overboard. It can also be used for pushing or fending off.

A boarding ladder is a set of steps temporarily or permanently fitted over the side or stern of a boat to assist persons coming aboard from a low pier or float. A swimming ladder is much the same, except that it extends down into the water.

Grab rails are hand-holding fittings mounted on cabin tops or sides, or in the interiors of boats, for personal safety when moving around the boat both on deck and below.

Magnetic compasses are mounted at the control station, often in binnacles. Compasses are swung in gimbals, pivoted rings that permit the compass bowl and card to remain relatively level regardless of the boat’s motion. To enable the helmsman to steer a compass course, a lubber’s line is marked on the inside of the compass bowl to indicate direction of the vessel’s bow. (See Chapter 13 for more on compasses.)

A lead (pronounced led) line is a length of light rope with a weight (the lead) at one end and markers at accurately measured intervals from that end. It is used for determining the depth of water alongside a vessel. A depth sounder is an electronic device for determining the depths; often such devices are referred to as “Fathometers”—a term that was originally the trademark of one manufacturer of electronic depth sounders (see Chapter 16). Boats frequently used in shallow waters may be equipped with a long, slender sounding pole, with depth in feet and fractions marked off from the lower end; there may be a special mark indicating the craft’s draft.

A barometer is often carried aboard a boat; it measures and indicates atmospheric pressure. A barograph records changing atmospheric pressure. Knowledge of the amount and direction of change in atmospheric pressure is useful in predicting changes in the weather (see Chapter 24).

A binocular is a device, usually hand-held, for detecting and observing distant objects. Separate sets of lenses and prisms enable the user to see with both eyes at the same time. (The term is properly singular, as in “bicycle,” but the plural form, “pair of binoculars,” for a single unit is often mistakenly used.)

A winch is a mechanical device, either hand or power operated, for exerting an increased pull on a line or chain, such as an anchor line or a sailboat’s halyards or sheets.

#### Ropes & Lines

Generally speaking, the term rope is little used aboard a boat; the correct term is line. “Rope” may be bought ashore at the store, but when it comes aboard a vessel and is put to use it becomes “line.” Marlinespike seamanship is the term applied to the art of using line and the making of knots, bends, hitches, and splices. (Chapter 23 is devoted to this important subject.)

Lines used to secure a boat to a shore structure are called mooring lines or dock lines. Bow lines and stern lines lead shoreward and keep the boat from drifting out from the shore. spring lines lead aft from the bow or forward from the stern to prevent the boat from moving ahead or astern; refer to this page, Figure 6-23.

A painter is a line at the bow of a small boat, such as a dinghy, for towing or making fast. The line by which a boat is made fast to a mooring buoy is called a pennant (sometimes pendant). The pennant is slipped when it is cast off so the boat can get underway. A pennant is also a flag (see below).

Lines have standing parts and hauling parts. The standing part is the fixed part, the one that is made fast; the hauling part is the one that is taken in or let out as the line is used. Lines are foul when tangled, clear when ready to run freely. Ends of lines are whipped, or seized, when twine or thread is wrapped around them to prevent strands from untwisting, or unlaying. Ragged ends of lines are said to be fagged.

Heaving lines are light lines, usually with a knot or weight at one end to make it easier to throw them farther and more accurately. A knot that encloses a weight at the end of a heaving line is called a monkey’s fist.

Hawsers are very heavy lines in common use on tugboats and larger vessels.

#### Flags

Strictly speaking, a vessel’s colors are the flag or flags that it flies to indicate its nationality, but the term is often expanded to include all flags flown. An ensign is a flag that denotes the nationality of a vessel or its owner, or the membership of its owner in an organization (other than a yacht club).

A burgee is a triangular, rectangular, or swallow-tailed flag usually denoting yacht club or similar unit membership. A pennant is a flag, most often triangular in shape, used for general designating or decorative purposes.

The hoist of a flag is its inner vertical side; also its vertical dimension. The fly is its horizontal length from the hoist out to the free end; see Figure 1-32. The union is the upper portion near the hoist—in the U.S. national flag, the blue area with the white stars. The union jack is a flag consisting solely of the union of the national flag. (See Chapter 25 for more on flags and how they should be flown.)

Figure 1-32 The principal parts and dimensions of a flag are shown here. For most flags the ratio between the hoist and the fly is 2:3, but this will vary with pennants. Flags should always be flown correctly.

### Terms Used in Boating Activities

In addition to the numerous terms for the boat itself, there are many others to be learned in connection with boating in general. The list of these is virtually endless, and those that follow are only the more basic and often-used ones.

#### Docks, Piers & Harbors

There is a difference between strict definition and popular usage by many in boating for the term “dock.” Properly speaking, a dock is the water area in which a boat lies when it is made fast to shore installations—and “made fast” is the proper term rather than “tied up.” In boating, however, the term “dock” is usually applied, albeit incorrectly, to structures bordering the water area in which boats lie. To dock a vessel is to bring it to a shore installation and make it fast.

A drydock is one that can be shut off from the surrounding water and pumped out in order to make repairs on a vessel’s hull. A wharf (or quay, pronounced “key”) is a structure parallel to the shore, whereas a pier projects outward from the shoreline; see Figure 1-33. Piles (or pilings) are substantial elongated objects driven into the bottom to which craft may be made fast or which support a structure. A group of piles driven close together and bolted or bound with wire cables into a single structure is called a dolphin. (The name “dolphin” is also given to a species of marine mammal as well as separately to a species of ocean game fish.) Piles are often used to form slips out from a pier or wharf in which boats can be docked or berthed; short catwalks (or finger piers) may extend out between the slips for easier access to the boats. A boat is made fast to a pile, in a slip, or alongside a pier or wharf.

Figure 1-33 A pier, as shown here, is a structure that projects out from the shore. A wharf is a structure that is parallel to the shore for making fast all types of vessels.

An anchorage may be a carefully chosen, protected body of water suitable for anchoring, or an area specifically designated by governmental authorities in which vessels may anchor; special regulations may prevail in these areas. A harbor is an anchorage that affords reasonably good protection for a vessel, with shelter from wind and sea; strictly speaking, it applies to the water area only. Port is a term that includes not only the harbor but all the facilities for freight, passengers, and services, such as wharves, piers, or warehouses. A marina or yacht basin is a protected facility primarily for recreational craft; see Figure 1-34.

Figure 1-34 Marinas provide sheltered dockage and various services for small craft and yachts. Piers extend out from the shore, and finger piers project from them to provide better access to each boat. A self-propelled sling lift can take boats out of the water for work. Smaller powerboats are often lifted out and stacked in dry storage ashore with a large forklift truck; they are taken off the rack and launched for each use on the water.

Jetties are embankments connected to the shore; when these are used to protect an inlet or harbor, and have no connection to the land, they are breakwaters. Groins are jetty-like dikes built out at roughly a 90° angle from the shore to lessen erosion of the shoreline.

Boats are hauled out of the water on inclined planes at the water’s edge called ways (also marine ways or railways). The framework that supports a boat as she is hauled out is a cradle. Boats are also lifted bodily out of the water and set on shore for storage or work in slings, which are lowered, passed under the hull, and raised by a crane or a straddle crane (often called a Travelift, the name of one brand).

Heave is a nautical term for throwing or pulling on a line. One heaves in on a line when he pulls in the slack and takes a strain on it. When a line is let out, one pays it out; to lessen the strain on a line or let it out slightly or slowly, one eases it. A line is snubbed when its outward run is checked; cast off when it is removed from the boat and left on the dock; and taken in when removed from the dock and brought on board the boat.

The bitter end of a line is the extreme end, the end made fast when all line has been paid out. The middle part of a line not including either end is the bight, particularly when formed into a loop. If a strain is put on a line heavy enough to break it, it parts.

Belay has two meanings. A line is belayed when it is secured without knotting to a cleat or a belaying pin; “belay,” when spoken, means to stop or cancel an action.

Tackle is a broad, general term applied to equipment and gear used aboard a boat. It has a specific use, however, to mean a combination of line and blocks (pulleys) used to increase a pulling or hoisting force. The wheels or rollers of the blocks are the sheaves (pronounced “shivs”). When a line is passed through a block or hole it is reeved; to render is to ensure that the line will pass freely through a block or hole.

#### Anchors & Moorings

An anchor is a specially shaped metal device designed to dig efficiently into the bottom under a body of water and hold a vessel in place despite winds and currents. (See Chapter 9, which is devoted to anchors and their use.) Ground tackle is a general term embracing anchors, lines, and other gear used in anchoring. On small craft, the anchor line or chain may be referred to as the rode. The anchor carried on a boat for most normal uses is its working anchor. A heavier model carried for emergencies is termed a storm anchor, and a smaller, lighter anchor for brief daytime stops when the boat will not be left unattended is popularly called a lunch hook. Anchors come in many designs and many sizes for each design; refer to Chapter 9, Figures 9-01 to 9-11.

The term kedge is applied to an anchor of any type that is used for getting a boat off when it has run aground in water shallower than its draft. The kedge is carried out by a dinghy or other means and set so that a pull on the line will help get the boat off, or at least keep it from being driven harder aground; this process is called kedging.

When a boat is anchored, the ratio of the length of line in use to the distance to the harbor or anchorage bottom, measured vertically from the deck at the bow, is termed the scope.

A mooring is a semi-permanent anchorage installation, consisting of a heavy anchor (usually of the mushroom type) or block of concrete, chain, a mooring buoy, and a pennant of nylon or other synthetic line.

### Motions of a Boat

A vessel grounds when it touches bottom; if stuck there, it is aground. When a boat moves through the water, it is said to be underway. According to government regulations, a vessel is underway at any time that it is not aground, at anchor, or made fast to the shore. The direction in which it is moving is made more specific by stating that it makes headway (moving forward), sternway (moving backward), or leeway (to one side or the other, as when pushed by a beam wind or current). A boat is said to be underway with no way on when it is free of the bottom or shore but is making no motion through the water (adrift); it may be moving with respect to the bottom as a result of wind or current. A vessel has steerageway if it is moving fast enough through the water for its rudder to be effective. A vessel’s anchor is said to be aweigh when it has broken out of the bottom and has been lifted clear.

The disturbed water that a boat leaves astern as a result of its motion is its wake. The flow of water that results from the action of its propeller or propellers is termed wash. Both of these effects are commonly lumped together as “wake”; see Figure 1-35.

Figure 1-35 Take care that your wake—the area of disturbed water behind you—does not disturb or damage other craft, shorelines, or shore facilities.

Side-to-side rotation of a boat in rough water around an imaginary fore-and-aft axis is called roll; a seesaw rotation as the bow rises and falls in waves is termed pitching. A boat yaws when it rotates around an imaginary vertical axis amidships, for example when struck on the quarter by a following sea; see Figure 1-36. If it yaws too widely and is thrown broadside into the trough of the waves (between the crests and parallel to them), it may broach (or broach to), a dangerous situation that should be carefully avoided. In very rough seas a small boat can be thrown end-over-end; this is pitchpoling.

Figure 1-36 Pitching, rolling, and yawing are normal motions of a boat in moderate seas, although they may combine to create uncomfortable results. In rough seas, they can be dangerous.

A boat may capsize without foundering. A boat knocked down so it lies on its side in the water or turns over has capsized; when it fills with water—from any cause—and sinks, it has foundered. If a boat fills with water from over the side, it swamps. Before his vessel is reduced to such straits, the wise skipper heaves to, reducing headway and generally lying with the bow slightly off from meeting the waves head on. He may put out a sea anchor that will hold the bow at the most favorable angle; this is usually in the form of a canvas cone or nylon “parachute” that rides just under the surface, serving as a drag. A drogue is a similar device set from the stern.

#### Trim

Trim relates to the way a boat floats in the water. When it floats properly as designed, it is on an even keel, but if it inclines to port or starboard, it lists. Heel conveys the same idea as list, a sideward inclination from the vertical, usually temporary, particularly when under sail. If a vessel is too heavily loaded forward, it trims by the head (or is down by the bow). If its draft is excessive aft, it trims by the stern (or is down by the stern).

#### Directions from the Boat

Dead ahead refers to any point or object that the vessel is approaching directly on a straight course. Dead astern is the opposite direction. An object that is at right angles (90°) to the centerline (keel) of a boat is abeam or broad on the beam. If the boat passes near to it, it is said to be close aboard. Vessels are abreast of one another when they are side by side, whether underway, anchored, or docked.

The direction midway between abeam and dead ahead is broad on the bow, port or starboard as the case may be. Similarly, an object seen midway between abeam and dead astern is broad on the (port or starboard) quarter.

To express the direction of another vessel or object relative to our boat, we say that it bears so-and-so, using the phraseology above. For intermediate directions through a circle centered on the observer’s boat, the traditional point system can be used, with 32 points making a complete circle; see Figure 1-37. Each direction in the point system is named. A ship or other object seen from your craft might be said to bear two points abaft the port beam, one point on the starboard bow, etc. Half-points and quarter-points do exist but are rarely used. Many skippers now use the “clock” system to indicate direction from the boat, with the bow at 12 o’clock and the stern at 6 o’clock. The direction of a remote object is its bearing.

Figure 1-37 In the traditional 32-point system of relative bearings, the circle around a boat is divided into eight sections, four per side, as shown. Each of the pie-shaped sections is further divided into points, each of which is 11¼ degrees of arc.

Windward means toward the direction from which the wind is blowing. A boat goes to windward, but in speaking of the side of a vessel, and the objects on that side, on which the wind is blowing, it is better to refer to this as the weather side.

Opposite to windward is leeward (pronounced loo’ard), the direction away from the wind, toward which it is blowing. The lee side of a boat is the side away from the wind, and a boat makes leeway when blown sideways off its course. A vessel can find shelter in the lee of the land when it is under a weather shore but should stay well clear of a dangerous lee shore in heavy weather.

### Powerboat Terms

Certain basic boating terms apply specifically to craft equipped with some form of engine, whether inboard (mounted within the hull) or outboard (mounted on the transom and detachable).

Figure 1-38 A propeller moves a boat by converting the rotation of the prop shaft into thrust. The thrust results from the combination of hydrodynamic lift force created by a pressure difference between the two sides of its blades and the reaction force created by the blades as they are forced against the water at an angle.

#### Propulsion

Thrust for the movement of the boat through the water is achieved by the rotation of a propeller, which draws in water from ahead and pushes it out astern; see Figure 1-38. Often-used terms for a propeller are “wheel” or “screw.” Boats with two engines and propellers are referred to as twin-screw craft. A more recent development is the sterndrive (or i/o, for inboard-outboard); see Figure 1-39. The I/O is powered by an inboard engine, typically mounted as far aft as possible. The external part of the I/O—called the outdrive—resembles the lower unit and prop of an outboard, and as with an outboard can be adjusted to provide thrust at the most efficient angle. Some boats dispense with propellers, instead using their engines to power specially designed water pumps that provide waterjet propulsion. In the newest approach, inboard engines mounted far aft are geared to highly maneuverable pod drives seated under the hull. Depending on the manufacturer, the pod-drive propellers can face forward or aft; see this page.

Figure 1-39 A sterndrive’s lower unit permits the coupling of a powerful inboard engine with a steerable and trimmable propeller shaft. This V-8 gasoline engine is mated to a sterndrive with twin counter-rotating blades.

#### Engine Mountings

An inboard engine is placed on engine mounts that are fastened above engine beds—stout structural members running fore-and-aft. A shaft log is the device on a boat through which the propeller shaft passes to reach the water; a stuffing box prevents water from entering at this point. On many boats, a propeller shaft is supported externally under the hull by one or more struts; see Figure 1-40.

Figure 1-40 On a boat with an inboard engine (or engines), a propeller shaft for each engine extends from inside the craft through the shaft log to the propeller. A strut supports the outer end and a stuffing box keeps water from entering the hull.

Some boats have a v drive, in which the engine is mounted so that the drive shaft extends forward to a gearbox, which reverses its direction to come out under the hull in a normal manner; this permits a compact engine-in-the-stern arrangement.

#### Reverse & Reduction Gears

Reverse gears change the direction of rotation of the propeller so as to give thrust in the opposite direction for stopping the craft or giving it sternway. Reduction gears are often combined with the reversing function so that the propeller, turning at a slower rate than the engine, will have increased efficiency. The gears of outdrive and V-drive units include the reversing capability and a reduction ratio if required.

#### Engine Components & Accessories

A complete engine assembly normally includes a fuel pump to feed fuel under pressure, an oil pump to supply lubricating oil where needed within the engine, and one or more water pumps for circulating cooling water. An engine is raw water-cooled if water for cooling is drawn from the water in which the craft is floating, through a hull fitting, circulated in the engine, and then discharged overboard. A closed cooling system absorbs engine heat in a circulating flow of fresh water and antifreeze within the engine and transfers the heat to raw cooling water in a heat exchanger, or is dissipated in the water in which the boat is floating by means of an external keel cooler.

Engine instruments usually include gauges for indicating oil pressure, cooling water temperature, and battery charging or discharging (ammeter). A tachometer indicates the speed of the engine in revolutions per minute (rpm), and may indicate the cumulative revolutions or operating hours as a guide for routine maintenance. Gasoline engines are fitted with flame arresters—screen-like metal fittings over the induction air intakes so that any flame from a backfire cannot enter the engine compartment.

Figure 1-41 Marine inboard engines are often adaptations of standard automotive engines; the differences are mainly in the cooling system.

On some quite small outboard motors, a shear pin is part of the propeller assembly. This small pin of relatively soft metal breaks apart—shears—when the propeller strikes a hard underwater object, thus saving the motor from more serious damage; the pin is easily replaced. Larger motors use a slip clutch for the same protective purpose.

### Sailboat Terms

Although some powerboat terms will also be applicable to many sailboats (especially those with an auxiliary engine), sailors have a language of their own.

All boaters, even powerboat skippers, should have a working knowledge of the basic terminology of sailboats and sailing.

#### Basic Sailboat Components

The principal components of a sailboat are its hull, spars, and sails. The hull has been described earlier in this chapter.

#### Spars

The term spars is used broadly to cover masts, booms, gaffs, etc.; see Figure 1-42. Masts are the principal vertical spars from which sails are set. Masts are stepped when put in position, and are raked if inclined aft at an angle. The horizontal spar along the lower edge of a fore-and-aft sail is a boom. When a four-sided sail has its upper edge laced to a fore-and-aft spar, that spar is a gaff.

Figure 1-42 Standing rigging supports the mast against the great strains imposed by wind on sail. The sailboat shown here has upper and lower shrouds, a single forestay, and a split backstay.

#### Rigging

All the various lines about a vessel that secure and control the sails, masts, and other spars are its rigging. Lines or wires bracing the mast and certain other fixed spars comprise the standing rigging; those used for hoisting and adjusting the sails make up the running rigging.

Standing rigging—usually wire rope—includes shrouds from the top or upper part of a mast to the sides of the boat; a forestay, which runs from the mast to the bow; and a backstay, which, if used, generally runs from the mast to the boat’s stern.

The slack is usually taken out of a stay or shroud by the use of a turnbuckle (or rigging screw), a metal sleeve threaded right-handed in one end and left-handed in the other so that when turned in one direction, eyebolts in both ends are drawn in and so shorten the fitting, thus tightening the standing rigging. When turned in the opposite direction, the fitting increases its overall length and provides slack; see Figure 1-43.

Figure 1-43 A turnbuckle is used to vary the tension on an element of the standing rigging, such as a shroud or stay. Turned one way, it lengthens and so reduces the tension; turned the opposite way, it shortens, increasing the tension on the shroud or stay.

#### Sails

Canvas is a general term for a boat’s sails, although modern sails are made of lighter synthetic materials. Sails draw when they fill with wind and provide power to drive the boat through the water. One makes sail when the sails are hoisted; one shortens sail when the area of sails in use is reduced. A sail is reefed by partly lowering it and securing it so that it continues to draw, but with reduced area and power. The sail is dowsed (or doused) when it is lowered quickly, furled when it is folded or rolled and then secured to the boom or yard. One looses sail when unfurling it. A suit of sails is a complete set for a particular boat.

#### Sailing Terms

As sailboats cannot sail directly into the wind, the wind is almost always coming over one side or the other. When the wind is coming over the starboard side, the boat is said to be on a starboard tack; A port tack is just the opposite, with the wind coming over the port side. A boat tacks when she comes up (heads) into the wind and changes the side over which it blows. In tacking, a boat comes about. Changing tacks with the wind passing astern rather than ahead of the boat is called jibing (pronounced with a long first i as in ice); jibes can occur accidentally when sailing downwind (with the wind astern) and can be dangerous when the boom sweeps quickly across the boat.

After the sails have been hoisted by their halyards, they are trimmed with their sheets (jibsheet, mainsheet, etc.)—lines used to control their lateral position and movement. To trim is to haul in and tighten up on the sheet attached to a sail or its boom. As mentioned, sheets are eased when they are let out. Headsails normally have two sheets so that they can be trimmed on either tack; other sails have only one sheet.

A sailboat is close hauled (full and by) when she is sailing with the wind as far ahead as possible, about 45° off the bow in most boats (this is also termed sailing on the wind, sailing to windward, or beating). As the boat is steered further away from the wind, it bears off and is reaching, with close reaching, beam reaching, and broad reaching occurring successively as the wind moves further aft. With the wind astern, the sailboat is running (or sailing downwind, off the wind, free, or scudding).

See Chapter 8 for a discussion of sailboat seamanship, with additional specialized terms.

### Rowboats & Canoes

Although this book is primarily for the skippers of motorboats and sailing craft, it is good to know the essential facts about boats propelled by muscle-power. Dinghies are often rowed, and light motorboats are at times rowed or paddled to safety when the engine fails. The technique of paddling and rowing is an art in itself, best learned by practice under proper instruction, but the various terms involved can be made familiar here.

#### Rowboats & Oars

Rowboat is the term generally applied to light craft intended to be propelled by one or more persons using oars. These are long, slender, round, usually wooden shafts shaped into a handle (grip) at one end and a flat blade at the other; between these ends is the loom, or shaft, of the oar.

The transverse seats in rowing craft are called thwarts. To support the thwart, a vertical piece is often fitted amidships, called a thwart stanchion. Stretchers (also called foot boards, although this creates confusion with an alternate term for bottom boards) are sometimes fitted athwartships against which the oarsman can brace his feet.

The terms rowlock and oarlock are synonymous. These are the fittings in the gunwale that provide a pivot point for the oars when rowing. There are many styles of rowlocks; some are open, others closed; some mounted permanently, others removable; some attached to the oars. Wooden thole pins (the ancient forerunner of rowlocks), driven into holes or sockets along the gunwale, are still sometimes used.

Where the loom of the oar bears against the rowlock, it is often protected from excess wear by a leather (which may be of leather or rubber). On the side of the leather toward the handle, there may be a button, a ring around the oar to keep it from slipping outward through the oarlock. Where the loom becomes a blade is the neck (or throat) of the oar. The tip of the blade, its outer end, may be metal-sheathed for protection from wear.

A person who is sculling stands in the stern and propels the craft by working a single oar back and forth, using either one or two hands.

#### Canoes & Paddles

Canoe is the term applied to very lightly built, open craft of narrow beam and shallow draft that are paddled rather than rowed; they are normally double-ended.

A paddle is much like an oar except that it is shorter. The various parts of a paddle are named the same as for an oar. The grip is shaped differently since the paddle is used vertically rather than almost horizontally; the blade normally will be somewhat wider for its length in comparison with an oar.

Some paddles are double-ended (double-bladed) so that they may be more conveniently dipped alternately on either side of the canoe, an advantage when one person is propelling the boat rather than two. Double-bladed paddles are commonly used with kayaks, covered canoes with a small opening in the center, originally modeled on Eskimo canoes.

### Water Movements & Conditions

The water in which we go boating is rarely still and motionless. It flows in various directions, and often moves up and down. Knowledge of these motions, and the proper terminology relating to them, is essential.

#### Tides & Currents

The word tide is one of the most misused of nautical terms. Properly speaking, it means only the rise and fall, the vertical change in level of bodies of water as a result of the gravitational pulls of the moon and sun. Commonly, but incorrectly, “tide” is also used to refer to the inflow and outflow of water as a result of changes in tidal level. Current is the proper term for a horizontal flow of water—tidal current for flows resulting from tidal influences; see Figure 1-44. It is proper to say a “two-knot current,” but not a “two-knot tide.” (A knot is defined on this page.)

Figure 1-44 Current is the horizontal flow of water. A buoy’s leaning is often an indication of the speed at which the water is moving. In coastal areas, currents result from changes in tidal levels. Where normal river flows exist, the combined current effect may be in either direction.

High water (high tide) is the highest level reached by a rising tide; low water (low tide) is the lowest level reached by a falling tide. The range of the tide is the difference between successive highs and lows; it is not always the same as the days go by. Spring tides occur when the moon is new or full and have a greater range than those at other times. (The word “spring” in this instance has nothing to do with the season of the year.) Neap tides are those occurring at quarter moons; these have a less than average range.

The incoming tidal current running toward the shore, or upstream in a river, is the flood. The retreating, or downstream, current is the ebb. The direction in which a current flows is its set, and its velocity is its drift. (The amount of leeway that a vessel makes is also its drift.) Slack is the short period of time between flood and ebb currents when there is no observable flow in either direction. Stand is the period when there is no appreciable rise or fall in the tidal level. Slack and stand usually do not occur simultaneously at any given place.

For more on tides and currents, refer to Chapter 17.

#### Waves, Swells & Seas

Various terms are used to describe specific water movements or conditions of the surface; see Figure 1-45. A broad term, waves, is frequently used for disturbed conditions on a body of water; these actually represent vertical movement of water particles regardless of their apparent forward motion. Sea is a general term often used to describe waves and water action on the surface. Rips are short, steep waves caused by the meeting of currents—not to be confused with ripples, slight disturbances of the water’s surface resulting from gentle breezes. The confused water action found at places where tidal currents meet is also called a chop, a term also applied to small, closely spaced waves resulting from wind action on small bodies of water.

Figure 1-45 Waves result from local wind action on the water surface but may travel great distances as swells. They crest and become breakers as they move into shallower waters. Dangerous waves form over bars, such as this one off a Pacific Coast inlet. The U.S. Coast Guard trains regularly in conditions like these. Recreational skippers should avoid them at all costs.

Swells (ground swells) are long, heavy undulations of the surface resulting from disturbances some distance away on oceans and seas. Surf is produced when waves coming toward the shore leave deep water, forming breakers on the shore or beach as they crest and curl over. A following sea is one that comes up from astern, running in the same direction as the boat is going. A head sea is just the opposite. Beam seas come from either side. Cross or confused seas are irregular ones with components from two or more directions.

### Navigation & Piloting

Navigation is the art and science of safely and efficiently directing the movements of a vessel from one point to another. Most boaters are primarily interested in two of its subdivisions. Piloting is navigation using visible references and the depth of the water. Dead reckoning is the plotting of a vessel’s position using courses and distances from the last known position. Chapters 13 through 18 cover these subjects and related topics.

Another branch of navigation is electronic navigation, used in varying degrees by inshore and offshore boatmen. GPS (Global Positioning System) has become universally popular due to its proven reliability and convenience and ever-decreasing cost, but skippers must take care to retain their basic piloting skills; see Figure 1-46. Chapter 16 provides details on electronic navigation.

Figure 1-46 GPS-based chartplotters like this one can be customized to show multiple functions like chart features, water depths, and radar readouts on a single screen.

Then there is celestial navigation, taking sights by sextant (a precision navigation instrument for measuring angles) on the sun, moon, planets, and stars, and using these data with a nautical almanac and sight reduction tables (or a computer) to determine positions; a highly accurate source of time information is also needed. Celestial navigation is used for long offshore passages, primarily to back up electronic navigation systems. Celestial navigation is not covered in this book, but many texts are available, including Dutton’s Navigation and Piloting.

#### Responsibilities

Whether fishing in a small lake, cruising down a river, or crossing large bodies of water out of sight of land, the skipper of a boat has the moral and legal responsibility of knowing how to navigate and having the proper tools.

While this responsibility should weigh heavily on every boat owner, the ability to navigate also brings real rewards. Great satisfaction and pleasure as well as renewed confidence can be derived from successfully navigating a vessel. Piloting and dead reckoning offer an intellectual challenge that can be matched with a sense of accomplishment.

#### Basic Tools

The basic tools of piloting and dead reckoning are a chart (with appropriate plotting instruments), a magnetic compass, and a log or marine speedometer. Other tools are also very useful, such as an electronic depth sounder and a binocular.

#### Charts

A nautical chart (not “map”!) provides a wealth of information for interpretation by a knowledgeable boater. Every chart is a scaled-down representation of a water area (and some adjacent land) overlaid with a grid system. The lines of the grid system are used to determine latitude and longitude; see also Chapter 15. Lines of latitude are termed parallels because they run parallel to the equator. Latitude is measured from 0° at the equator to 90° either North or South at the respective poles. Longitude is measured from 0° at the prime meridian (Greenwich, England) to 180° East or West, which is the same longitude, and with minor jogs, the international dateline.

#### Distances, Speeds & Depths

On salt water, distances are measured in nautical miles. The international nautical mile, the distance described on the earth’s surface by one minute of latitude, is slightly more than 6,076 feet (1,852 m exactly), making it about one-seventh longer than the statute mile used in the U.S. on shore and freshwater bodies and along the Intracoastal Waterways, which is 5,280 feet.

Where nautical miles are used for distance, the unit of speed is the knot, one nautical mile per hour. Note that the “per hour” is included in the definition—to say “knots per hour” is incorrect. Miles per hour meaning statute miles is the correct term for most inland freshwater bodies, as it is on shore.

In boating, depths are usually measured in feet, but for offshore navigation, the unit fathom may be used—it is six feet.

Increasingly, metric units are coming into use. For distance on the oceans and seas, the nautical mile is still used, but meters (m) are used for shorter distances. Meters and decimeters (1/10 of a meter) are used for depths and heights. Useful approximate equivalencies are: 1 nautical mile = 1.852 km; 1 statute mile = 1.609 km; 1 fathom = 1.83 m.

#### Courses

A course is the direction in which a vessel is to be steered—the desired direction of travel through the water. A true course is one referred to true (geographic) north—it is the angle between the vessel’s centerline and the geographic meridian when it is on course. Magnetic north is the direction in which a compass points when not subjected to any local disturbing effects. A magnetic course is one with reference to magnetic north; it is almost always different from the true course. Compass north is the direction of north indicated by a compass on a vessel; it may or may not be the same as magnetic north. A compass course is one steered by reading the compass; it may or may not be the same as the magnetic course. The heading is the direction in which a vessel’s bow points at any given moment.

#### Variation & Deviation

Variation is the angular difference between true north and the direction of magnetic north at a given point on earth. Variation is easterly if the north mark of a compass card points to the east of true north, westerly if the opposite. Deviation is the error in a magnetic compass caused by local magnetic influences on the boat. It is easterly or westerly as the compass points east or west of magnetic north. Compass error is the resulting combination of variation and deviation. See Chapter 13 for more on the mariner’s compass.

#### Bearings

A bearing is the direction of an object from the observer and may be stated in terms of true, magnetic, or compass values. A relative bearing is the direction of an object from the observer measured from the vessel’s heading clockwise from 000° to 360°; see Figure 1-47.

Figure 1-47 Relative bearings are measured as angles from dead ahead clockwise around the boat. Directions are always given as three-digit numbers, using leading zeros as necessary (e.g., 050°, not 50°).

#### Plotting

In navigation, one plots various data on a chart, takes bearings to determine his position (fix), and takes departure from a known position to commence his dead reckoning. To chart information is to record it on an existing chart of the area; see Figure 1-48.

Figure 1-48 A careful skipper plots courses on a chart, and notes the time of significant events, especially changes of course or speed. Chapter 18 covers important procedures for determining position.

#### Aids to Navigation

Various governmental authorities, and a few private organizations and individuals, establish and maintain aids to navigation—artificial objects to supplement natural landmarks. These may be used to indicate both safe and unsafe waters; the boatman must know the meanings and use of each.

Buoys are floating aids to navigation with various characteristic shapes and colors. They may have lights or be unlighted; they may or may not have audible signals, such as bells, gongs, whistles, etc.; see Figure 1-49.

Figure 1-49 Aids to navigation include unlighted marks such as this nun buoy.

Daybeacons (not “markers”) are fixed aids normally consisting of distinctive signs, day-boards (also called daymarks), mounted on a pile or group of piles driven into the bottom. Dayboards will have a characteristic shape and color or colors.

Lights (not “flashers”) are aids consisting of a light source mounted on a fixed object (as distinguished from lighted buoys). Each light will have a characteristic color and on-off pattern; most light structures will also have dayboards for daytime identification. The term “light” covers all such aids from the relatively weak minor light on a single pile to the largest seacoast lighthouse.

Ranges are special combinations of day-boards and lights used to guide vessels in narrow channels.

Detailed information on aids to navigation is found in Chapter 14.

## MISCELLANEOUS TERMS

There are many words and phrases used in boating that do not fit neatly into one of the categories discussed thus far. When any part of a vessel’s gear or equipment breaks or gives way, it carries away; an object goes by the board when it goes over the side (overboard). If a boat is stove (hull broken in from outside), it springs a leak or makes water. When water is dipped out of a boat by hand the process is called bailing.

The term clear has many meanings. Upon leaving or entering a port when traveling between countries, a ship must clear through customs authorities. She clears the land when she leaves it, clears a shoal (mud or sandbank that makes shallow water) when she passes it by safely. The bilges are cleared of water when they are pumped out. Fouled lines are cleared by straightening them out and getting them ready for use.

A boat stands by when she remains with another craft to give her assistance if necessary. When used as an order, “stand by” means to wait and be prepared to carry out an instruction. Aye, or aye aye, is a properly nautical (if somewhat naval) way of acknowledging an order of instruction, indicating that it has been heard and understood, and will be obeyed.

Entries are made in a log (book) to record all events occurring aboard. A patent log is a device to record distance traveled.

One raises a light or landmark when it first becomes visible; one makes a landfall when the shore is first sighted on coming in from sea.

Passage is generally construed to mean a run from one port to another; voyage includes both the outward and homeward passages. Watches are periods of duty, usually four hours long, aboard a vessel; dog watches are shorter, two-hour periods between 4:00 and 8:00 p.m. (1600 and 2000 in the 24-hour system; see Chapter 16) used to rotate the watches so that a particular person does not have the watch for the same hours each day.

Lubberly is used to describe the doing of any task on board in a sloppy manner.

In nautical terminology, hard means fully or completely—as in turning a steering wheel hard aport (fully to the left) or hard over (in either direction).

A bar is a build-up, usually of sand, that reduces the depth of water; it may or may not be partially exposed above the surface of the water and it usually has an elongated shape. Bars frequently form across the openings (mouths) of rivers, creeks, harbors, etc. Larger, broader areas of shallow water are often termed flats.

A reef is a solid underwater obstruction, generally of rock or coral formation, although artificial reefs have been constructed of various debris to attract fish. A channel is a natural or dredged path through otherwise shoal waters.

The meaning of the word lay depends on its usage. One lays aft when he goes to the stern of the vessel. The lines of a boat are laid down before it is built. A boat is laid up when it is decommissioned for the winter in northern climates or is otherwise taken out of regular use. A sailboat lays its course when it can make the objective without tacking. When an oarsman stops rowing, he lays on his oars. Referring to rope or line, lay is the direction of the twist (right- or left-hand) and its tightness (hard or soft).

When a vessel is hauled out of the water it is shored up with supports to hold it upright. If it is not supported properly, so that it is held amidships while the bow and stern settle, the boat will assume a shape that is described as hogged. In contrast, if the amidships portion of the keel is not adequately supported and droops, the boat is said to be sagged.

A vessel is said to hail from its home port. A person hails another vessel at sea to get its attention, and speaks to it when communicating with it.

Chafing occurs when a line or sail rubs against a rough surface and wears excessively. To prevent this, line is usually encased in chafing gear made of plastic or rubber tubing. To protect sails from chafing and wearing, baggywrinkle, consisting of short lengths of old line matted together, is placed on shrouds, spreaders, and other parts of the rigging.

A shackle, or clevis, is a roughly U-shaped metal fitting with a pin that can be inserted through a hole in one arm of the U and screwed or pinned in the other arm to close the link; see Figure 1-50. Some special-purpose shackles close with a hinged snap or have a swivel built in. A thimble is a round or heart-shaped metal fitting with a deep outer groove around which line or wire can be eye-spliced. It protects the line from wearing on a shackle where it is joined to a chain, fastened to a deck fitting, etc.

Figure 1-50 A shackle, or clevis, is a horseshoe-shaped fitting that is useful in connecting chain to either an anchor or to a length of line ending in a thimble.

A fid is a smooth, tapered pin, usually made of wood, aluminum, or stainless steel, used to open up the strands of a rope for splicing.

A waterlight is an electric light, often automatically operated, that is attached to a life ring with a short length of line. It is intended for use in man-overboard (MOB) accidents at night.

The term charter has usage as both a verb and a noun. To charter a craft is to lease it from the owner for a temporary period of time. It may be chartered on a bare boat basis (without crew) or as a time charter (with crew). The contract covering the use of the boat is termed the charter.

Ships and large vessels may have compartments below deck used solely for carrying cargo; these are holds. The hatch giving access through the deck to such a hold is typically covered over with canvas and battened down with wooden or metal strips around the edges (battens) to secure it against storms and water across the deck. The same term is used for the general securing of a boat against adverse weather conditions. The term “batten” is also used for small semi-flexible strips of wood or plastic inserted into pockets on a sail to help control its shape

Another vessel is said to be seen hull down when she is at such a distance that her superstructure and/or masts are visible but the hull is not seen due to the curvature of the earth.

Flotsam is material floating on the surface of the water after a vessel has broken up and sunk. Larger pieces may be dangerous to the hull or shaft and propeller of small craft. Jetsam consists of items of equipment or cargo that have been deliberately jettisoned (thrown overboard) to lighten a vessel endangered by heavy seas.

A bollard is a heavy single or double post set into the edge of a wharf or pier to which the lines of a ship may be made fast; see Figure 1-51.

Figure 1-51 A bollard is a massive metal fitting placed along wharves and piers to which the lines of large vessels are made fast.

Cavitation occurs when a high-speed propeller develops a partial vacuum around the blades and loses its “bite” on the water, creating a loss of thrust and excessive shaft speed; continued cavitation can result in blade wear. On outboard motors where the propeller is relatively near the surface of the water and aft of the transom, a cavitation plate (more properly, an anti-cavitation plate) is mounted above the propeller to deflect downward the water discharge from the blades.

If the galley stove is of the type that requires its own vent above the deck, the pipe for this is called a charlie noble.

A boat is ship-shape when everything is in good order; well-found when it is well equipped. Bristol-fashion is a term used to describe an especially well-cared-for vessel. To unship an item of equipment is to unfasten or remove it from its normal working location or position. One swabs (or swabs down) the deck when he washes it down with a mop, called a swab in nautical language.

The term gangway is applied both to the area of a ship’s side where people come on board (board or embark) and disembark (or debark) and to the temporary ramp or platform used between the vessel and the wharf or pier; see Figure 1-52. In the latter usage, the terms gangplank and brow are also correct.

Figure 1-52 A gangway, or gangplank, is a ramp from the shore to a vessel. Some models have an optional side railing; many can be raised at one end to form a set of steps. A boarding ramp is often referred to as a “passerelle.”

A windlass is a particular form of winch, usually used with an anchor rode, with its drum on which the line or chain is wrapped turning on a horizontal axis. If the drum’s axis is vertical, the device may be called a capstan.

When an anchor line or chain is brought through the topsides rather than over the rail, it enters through a hawse hole and may run upward through a hawse pipe. An anchor chock is a fitting for holding an anchor securely on a deck.

Small boats, such as dinghies and runabouts, are hoisted aboard larger craft by davits—mechanical arms extending over the side or stern, or which can be swung around over the deck or swung out over the side, plus the necessary lines and blocks.

When subjected to heavy strains in working her way through high seas, a vessel is said to labor. If she takes the large waves easily, she is said to be sea kindly. A boat that takes head seas heavily and comes down hard on successive waves is said to pound; this is more likely to occur with a flat-bottomed, hard-chined hull. If a boat takes little spray aboard when running into a choppy sea, she is termed dry.

To flemish down a line is to secure it on deck in a tight flat coil roughly resembling a mat. When a line is laid down in loose, looping figure eights it is said to be faked (or flaked) down; each loop is a fake. (Refer to Chapter 23 for more on the proper handling of lines and all aspects of marlinespike seamanship.)

A boat is said to be off-soundings when she is so far out from the shore (offshore) that depths (soundings) cannot be conveniently measured for navigation; this is commonly taken as the 100-fathom line (on metric charts, the 200 meter curve is usually taken as the delineation). In contrast, a boat is on-soundings when she is within this line.

Admiralty law is the body of law pertaining to ships and to navigation and commerce on the seas.

A corinthian is any nonprofessional in the field of boating.

Some boats are damaged by dry rot, a fungal disease that causes timber to become brittle and crumble into powder. The fungus is of a type that is capable of carrying water into the wood it infests. The wood is greatly weakened by the action of the fungus. Prevention of standing water in corners and pockets, and adequate ventilation, are the best defenses against dry rot; chemical treatments can be used to prevent rot, and to attack existing rot infestations and restore strength.

##### BUT DON’T OVERDO IT!

There is virtually no end to the list of boating terms that could be included here, but practical limitations of space must prevail. What has been covered in this chapter will serve as a framework for the remainder of the book. As the boatman gains experience in this form of recreation, his vocabulary will broaden proportionately and naturally. It is hoped, however, that his enthusiasm for boating will not cause him to toss indiscriminate avasts, ahoys, and belays into every conceivable nook and corner of his conversation. Strained efforts to affect a salty lingo are conspicuously inappropriate.

For additional definitions, see Appendix F, Glossary of Selected Terms.

# CHAPTER2

Figure 2-01 Common sense tells the skipper of a recreational boat to stay out of a big ship’s way (see “The Rule of Tonnage” on this page), and so do the Navigation Rules (Chapter 5). Most boating laws and regulations codify common sense.

BOATING LAWS & REGULATIONS

Federal Jurisdiction • Requirements for Boat Registration or Documentation • Legal Responsibilities Involved in Chartering, Commercial Operations & International Voyaging

Boating laws and regulations can be divided into three main categories. The first deals with boat ownership: registration, numbering, and documentation, all covered in this chapter. The second category is legislation relating to equipment requirements and standards, as discussed in Chapter 3. The third category is the legal requirements for safe operation, known as the Navigation Rules (also called the Rules of the Road), as detailed in Chapters 4 and 5. Regulations relating to radio operation are found in Chapter 20.

A simple comparison can be made between recreational boating and the operation of motor vehicles, an activity that is so much a part of our everyday lives. Whereas motor vehicle laws first concentrated on operation, with legal requirements for safety features a more recent development, much of the early boating legislation, other than the Navigation Rules, was specifically aimed at equipment requirements.

For many decades states have required the operators of highway vehicles to have drivers licenses. While licenses are not usually required to operate a boat, increasing numbers of states are requiring that boaters must have taken and passed a state-approved boating safety course. Mandatory education is usually phased-in over a period of years.

## FEDERAL JURISDICTION

This book will concentrate on federal boating laws and regulations rather than state and local ordinances, rules, etc., due to the wider application of the federal laws. State and municipal regulations will be touched on later in this chapter, but only in broad terms because of the variations between different jurisdictions. You must familiarize yourself with the local requirements and restrictions for the waters that you use at home or when out cruising.

An understanding of federal jurisdiction over navigable waters is essential for all boaters; see Figure 2-01. Federal jurisdiction covers the applicability of federal laws and regulations with establishment of aids to navigation by the U.S. Coast Guard, and charting by the National Ocean Service or Army Corps of Engineers. That jurisdiction does not deprive state and local authorities of their rights to regulate aspects of waterways use that do not conflict with federal laws or regulations—local rules might relate to speed limits, restrictions on water skiing, etc. Many state boating laws also require safety equipment beyond that called for by acts of Congress and Coast Guard regulations.

### Limits of Federal Jurisdiction

There are several terms that are used in Federal laws and regulations covering their geographic applicability. Unfortunately, specific terms are not always logical or clear to the average reader, and some have different limits for the same term. The discussion that follows is basic and general in nature; it should not be considered the final word in all cases. Full details in legalistic language will be found in Titles 14, 19, 33, and 46 of the United States Code and the Code of Federal Regulations.

The starting point is the territorial sea baseline. This is the line that defines the shoreward extent of the territorial sea of the United States. Normally, this baseline is the mean low-water line along the coast of the U.S. As will be seen below, this baseline is fundamental to the description of several offshore zones.

The territorial sea of the United Sates consists of the waters, 12 nautical miles wide, adjacent to the coast of the U.S. and seaward of the territorial sea baseline. This basic definition, however, has some exceptions for regulations that define the territorial sea as extending only 3 miles seaward from the baseline. (It should be noted that other nations may define their territorial seas differently.)

The term internal waters of the United States means the waters shoreward of the territorial sea baseline. The term inland waters, used in some laws and regulations, has the same definition.

For the purposes of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the contiguous zone means a zone 9 nautical miles wide extending from 3 miles out from the territorial seas baseline to 12 miles out. For all other purposes, the contiguous zone is defined as all the waters within the area adjacent to and seaward of the territorial sea (as defined above) extending out to 24 nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline. Note however, that the U.S. contiguous zone does not extend into the territorial sea of another nation.

The U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) includes the waters seaward of and adjacent to the territorial sea, including the contiguous zone, extending 200 nautical miles from the territorial sea baseline, except where otherwise limited by treaty or other international agreement recognized by the United States.

For some purposes, the term high seas is used. This has several definitions, but generally can be considered as the Great Lakes and all waters seaward of the territorial sea.

The phraseology waters subject to tidal influence and waters subject to the ebb and flow of the tide appear in some laws and regulations. These are waters below mean high water as determined over a long-term tidal cycle; it does not mean high water resulting from storms, floods, etc.

The terms navigable waters of the united states, navigable waters, and territorial waters are also used in laws and regulations. In general, these terms apply to: (1) the territorial sea of the United States; (2) internal waters of the U.S. that are subject to tidal influence; and (3) internal waters that are not subject to tidal influence but are or have been used for substantial interstate or international commerce. Examples of the last category include major river systems, such as the Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, and Tennessee rivers; and major lakes that border more than one state, such as Lake Mead between Nevada and Arizona and Lake Champlain between New York and Vermont.

Waters subject to the jurisdiction of the united states and waters over which the united states has jurisdiction are terms that will be found in laws and regulations. These include the navigable waters of the United States (as defined above) and other waters specifically spelled out, such as waters on lands for which the United States has acquired title and waters made subject to U.S. jurisdiction by international agreement.

Figure 2-02 At entrances from the sea to rivers, bays, and similar water bodies, as well as along some stretches of shoreline, boundary lines have been established to mark the transition from International Navigation Rules to the Inland Rules. These are shown in magenta on charts as COLREGS demarcation lines.

Demarcation Lines for Navigation Rules Of special interest to boaters are the lines that separate waters governed by the International Navigation Rules from those subject to the U.S. Inland Rules (see Chapters 4 and 5). When the 1972 International Rules—termed “72 COLREGS” by the Coast Guard as a contraction of their formal name, International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972—came into effect, “demarcation lines” separating international and inland waters were established. In establishing these, it was found neither desirable nor practical to have an overall general line. Individual lines are defined instead, where practicable, by physical objects like fixed aids to navigation or prominent points on land, because such are readily discernible by eye rather than by instrument. The demarcation lines are set to be as short and direct as feasible, and as perpendicular as possible to vessel traffic flow. The general trend is from headland to headland, with highly visible objects used to define the line clearly. But sometimes the line is farther inland than would be expected, and whole bays, harbors, and inlets are subject to the International Rules. A boater must at all times know which set of Navigation Rules govern the waters he is in. Demarcation lines are shown on nautical charts (see Figure 2-02 and Chapter 16) and are described in detail in the U.S. Coast Guard’s Navigation Rules and Regulations Handbook (see Figure 2-03) and in the Coast Pilots (see this page).

Figure 2-03 The U.S. Coast Guard publication above contains the official text of both the International and the Inland Navigation Rules. As of 2020, however, this publication is being superseded by the Amalgamated International and U.S. Inland Navigation Rules, which is available at www.uscgboating.org/regulations/navigation-rules.php. See this page for details.

## FEDERAL LAWS & REGULATIONS

All boating and shipping is subject to laws and regulations. The former consists of acts of Congress that provide basic policies and rules upon which more specific and detailed regulations may be based. Regulations have the advantage of flexibility because they can be created, modified, or revoked more easily than laws, whose changes are subject to the full legislative process.

### U.S. Coast Guard Regulations

Most federal boating regulations are issued by the United States Coast Guard under authority given by Congress to the “Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating.” This rather cumbersome wording is necessary because federal law permits the transfer of this armed service from its peacetime Department (Homeland Security) to its wartime Department (Navy). The authority given by the U.S. Congress to the Department Secretary is, in most instances, routinely delegated to the Commandant of the Coast Guard.

Coast Guard regulations cover a wide variety of matters including boat equipment and operation, lights for vessels, aids to navigation, inland waters demarcation lines mentioned earlier, and other topics; see Figure 2-04.

Figure 2-04 Federal requirements for recreational boats are covered in the free U.S. Coast Guard brochure shown above, available online at www.uscgboating.org/images/420.PDF.

For technical questions regarding regulations, and for information not usually available from local Coast Guard district offices, the U.S. Coast Guard maintains an online boating safety resource center at www.uscgboating.org. Direct access to federal regulations, federal laws, state boating laws, navigation rules, Federal Register, and Boatbuilder’s Handbook is available from that same website’s home page. The home page for the U.S. Coast Guard itself is www.uscg.mil.

### Other Regulatory Agencies

Boaters on some waters will also be affected by regulations issued by other federal agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Park Service (see Chapter 22, Inland Boating). The operation of radio and radar transmitters on boats on all waters is subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as explained in Chapter 20.

### Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971

The Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 (FBSA/71) authorizes the “Secretary” to establish minimum safety standards for boats and “associated equipment,” provides for numbering of all undocumented vessels equipped with propulsion machinery, directs that a “Boating Safety Advisory Council” be established, and authorizes financial assistance to the states for boating safety programs.

#### Definition of Terms

FBSA/71 definitions, modified by the Passenger Vessel Safety Act of 1993 (PVSA/93), must be clearly understood, as they directly affect the act’s applicability.

In this act, the word “vessel” includes every description of watercraft, other than a seaplane, that can be used as a means of transportation on the water; see Figure 2-05. The term “boat” is limited to the following categories of vessels:

• Those manufactured or used primarily for noncommercial use.

• Those leased, rented, or chartered to another for the latter’s noncommercial use.

• Those engaged in the carrying of six or fewer passengers for hire.

Figure 2-05 All personal watercraft (PWCs) are considered to be “boats” or “vessels” and are subject to all laws and regulations covering such craft.

The distinction between “vessels” and “boats” is necessary because certain sections of the FBSA/71 (notably those dealing with safety standards and equipment) pertain only to the category called “boats.” Other sections (those dealing with numbering) pertain to a broader category—all undocumented vessels equipped with propulsion machinery. Still other provisions (the prohibition of negligent operation) pertain to all vessels. Note that there is no upper size limit in the definition of “boat” as used in the FBSA/71.

Despite its general aim toward regulating noncommercial boats and boating, craft carrying six or fewer passengers for hire (see the “passengers for hire” definition on this page) are included, because these are not covered by the laws for vessels carrying more than six passengers for hire. Livery and charter boats are included in the FBSA/71 because their operation is closely akin to noncommercial recreational use even though they are a part of a commercial enterprise.

The term “associated equipment” means:

• Any system, part, or component of a boat as originally manufactured or as sold for replacement, repair, or improvement of a boat.

• Any accessory or equipment for, or appurtenance to, a boat.

• Any marine safety article, accessory, or equipment intended for use by a person on a boat.

The word “State” means a state of the United States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the District of Columbia.

#### Applicability

The FBSA/71 applies to vessels and associated equipment used, or to be used, or carried on vessels on waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. This act also applies to every vessel owned in a “State” and used on the high seas—used on the waters beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.

Certain limited categories of vessels are excluded from coverage by the FBSA/71; these include foreign vessels, military or public vessels of the United States (except for recreational-type craft, which are included), vessels owned by a state or political subdivision thereof and used primarily for governmental purposes, and ships’ lifeboats.

#### Regulations

Although the Motorboat Act of 1940 (MBA/40) is no longer generally applicable to the “boats” of the 1971 act, the Coast Guard regulations that implemented the MBA/40 are retained and will remain in effect until replaced. The MBA/40 also remains in effect for commercial craft, such as fishing boats, less than 65 feet (19.8 m) in length.

#### Classes of Boats

For the purpose of applying graduated requirements for equipment as the size of the craft increases, the MBA/40 divides all motorboats into four “classes” based on length. This is “length overall” (LOA) as measured in a straight line parallel to the keel from the foremost part of the vessel to the aftermost part, excluding such bow- and stern-mounted projections as bowsprits, boomkins, rudders, and outboard motor brackets (refer to “Orienting Yourself on Board” on this page).

Class A

less than 16 feet (4.9 m) in length

Class 1

16 feet and over, but less than 26 feet (7.9 m) in length

Class 2

26 feet and over, but less than 40 feet (12.2 m) in length

Class 3

40 feet and over, but not more than 65 feet (19.8 m)

Note: As mentioned, regulations derived from the authority of the FBSA/71 have no upper limit of length. A number of FBSA/71 requirements use a 20 foot (6.1 m) length as a cutoff limit.

#### Required Equipment

The regulations of the MBA/40, applicable until superseded by new rules, contain provisions for required equipment, including personal flotation devices, fire extinguishers, and other items (see Chapter 3). It is specifically stated in the FBSA/71 that regulations will be issued covering items not now required on board, such as ground tackle and navigation equipment, but this has not yet been done. Any such new requirements will not become effective without considerable study and wide publicity.

Figure 2-06 Although it is not a U.S. federal requirement, in some states sailboats without mechanical power must be registered. All boats, including this sailboat, are subject to U.S. Coast Guard requirements for equipment such as life jackets.

#### Numbering of Boats

The FBSA/71 provides a system of boat numbering that is uniform throughout the United States, although the act delegates the issuing of certificates and number assignments to the states.

The FBSA/71 establishes broad standards for the numbering of vessels and provides for the issuance of more detailed regulations by the “Secretary.” The individual states prepare their boat-numbering laws and regulations in accordance with federal standards and then submit them to the Secretary for approval. The Secretary can later withdraw approval if the state does not administer its system in accordance with the federal requirements.

Vessels Subject to Numbering The FBSA/71 requires the numbering of all vessels used on waters subject to federal jurisdiction, or on the high seas if owned in the U.S., that are equipped with propulsion machinery regardless of horsepower. Exempted are foreign boats temporarily in U.S. waters, documented vessels, ships’ lifeboats, and governmental vessels other than recreational-type craft. (States may require the registration of documented boats, and the payment of fees, even though they are not numbered.)

A state numbering system may require the numbering of other craft (sailboats, rowboats, etc.) unless prohibited by federal legislation; see Figure 2-06. States may exempt craft used solely for racing.

Special provisions are made for tenders (dinghies) carried on board for other than lifesaving purposes.

“State of Principal Use” The FBSA/71 requires that a boat have a number obtained from “the State in which the vessel is principally used.” (Documented vessels are not required to display the state number on the hull.) This has been interpreted literally—where the boat is most often used on the water; i.e., not necessarily the state where the owner lives, nor the state in which the boat might customarily be set on its trailer. The term “used” is taken as meaning the time that the vessel is “on” the navigable waters of the United States, whether in motion, at anchor, at a mooring, or in a slip; see Figure 2-07.

Figure 2-07 A boat must be registered and numbered in its “state of principal use” even though this is not the state of the owner’s residence nor even that of where the boat may be stored on its trailer when out of the water (dry-docked).

Certificate of Number The identification number issued for a vessel is shown on a Certificate of Number. This certificate must be on board whenever the vessel is in use (with exceptions for small rental boats). The FBSA/71 specifies that a Certificate of Number must be of “pocket size”; see Figure 2-08. Any person using a boat must present its certificate for inspection at the request of any law enforcement officer.

Figure 2-08 The state-issued Certificate of Number must be on board whenever a boat is in use (except for small rental craft).

Federal law states that a certificate may not be valid for more than three years; many states issue registrations for shorter periods. All certificates may, of course, be renewed at or prior to expiration date.

Numbering Systems The specific details of boat-numbering are covered in Coast Guard regulations. The number pattern has two parts: a two-letter symbol identifying the state of principal use and a combination of numerals and letters for individual identification. For most states, the two-letter abbreviation is the same as that used by the U.S. Postal Service; in a few states, it is different.

The individual identification consists of not more than four Arabic numerals and two capital letters, or not more than three such numerals and three such letters; fewer numbers or letters may be used. The letters “I,” “O,” and “Q” are not used because they can be mistaken for the numerals “1” and “0.”

Numbers for Dinghies A state has the option of exempting dinghies from the numbering regulation. In such states, if used with a numbered vessel, a dinghy equipped with a motor of less than 10 horsepower need not be individually registered and numbered if it is “used as a tender for direct transportation between that vessel and the shore and has no other purpose.” The dinghy must display the number of the parent boat followed by the suffix “1” separated from the last letter by a space or hyphen as used in the basic number; for example, DC-4567-ED-1 or DC 4567 ED 1.

A dinghy used with a vessel not having a number, such as a documented boat, must be registered and have its own number as for any other boat if it is propelled by a motor of any horsepower.

Size & Style of Numbers The regulations require that boat numbers be clearly legible, and also contain specifications for style and size. The letters and numerals must be plain (no border or trim) vertical block characters not less than three inches in height. They must not be slanting or script style; see Figure 2-09. The numbers and letters should all be of the same color.

Figure 2-09 The correct style and spacing of registration numbers is shown at left above. Letters and numbers without spacing and use of italics or script characters (above) are incorrect and unacceptable.

Contrast Numbers must provide good contrast with their background—black on white or white on black best meets this requirement. A backing or mounting plate may be used but must be of sufficient size to provide good contrast for the numbers, and thus good legibility, without regard to the hull color.

Display of Numbers The identification number must be painted on, or attached to, each side of the forward half of the vessel, and no other number may be displayed there. (This does not apply to serial numbers on small validation stickers that some states issue to note payment of current fees.) In most cases the numbers are quite near the bow, but since they need be displayed only on the boat’s “forward half” it is sensible, on boats with considerable bow flare, to place the numbers far enough aft to be on a more nearly vertical surface and thus more visible; see Figure 2-10. Inflatable boats may be marked using flexible vinyl or rubber numbers or by adhering the markings to demountable plastic plates.

Figure 2-10 A common misconception is that registration numbers must be at or close to the bow of a boat. The legal requirement is only that they be on the forward half of the boat. Subject to this limitation, they should be placed far enough aft to ensure easy readability.

Numbers are placed on a boat so as to read from left to right on both sides of the bow. They may be on the hull or on a permanent superstructure. The digits between the two sets of letters in the total number must be separated from those letters by hyphens or spaces. The hyphen or blank space must be equal to the width of any letter other than “I” or any numeral other than “1”; refer to Figure 2-09.

Identification numbers must be maintained properly to ensure legibility at all times.

Names or insignia may be displayed on the bow of a boat, but they must not detract from the legibility of the registration numbers. Only one set of numbers may be displayed at any time. If a boat is transferred to a new state, the old numbers must be removed.

Applications & Renewals The addresses of state boat registration offices can be found on the various state government websites.

The same numbers are reassigned for each registration period by a regular renewal certificate. Upon transfer of ownership, if the boat continues in the same state of principal use, the old numbers stay on the craft and are assigned to the new owner.

Numbers may not be transferred from one boat to another, except for special dealers’ and manufacturers’ numbers issued for demonstrating, transporting, or testing boats.

Fees Under the FBSA/71, states may set their own fees for registering and numbering boats. Fees vary widely from state to state—in some jurisdictions they merely cover the cost of administering the numbering program; in others they are sources of revenue for the state.

The 1971 law specifically provides that a state may require proof of payment of state and local sales, use, and excise taxes before issuing a Certificate of Number. Withholding certification on any other grounds is not authorized, except that a title or proof of ownership may be required.

Reciprocity When a vessel is numbered in its state of principal use, it is considered to be in compliance with the numbering system of any state in which it is temporarily used. There is no specific time limit stated in the federal law if such use is truly “temporary”; states often set their own time limits. This is of considerable advantage to boaters who may cruise or trailer their craft to other state waters for vacation.

When a vessel is taken to a new state of principal use, that state must recognize the validity of its number for at least 60 days before requiring new registration.

Notification of Changes If a boat is destroyed, or abandoned, or sold, or used for more than 60 days in a state other than the one that issued its certificate, or if it is documented, a report must be made to the issuing office within 15 days. The boat’s certificate becomes invalid and must be surrendered, and its numbers (and any validation stickers) must be removed. A report must also be made if the boat is stolen and when recovered after having been stolen.

An owner’s change of address must be reported to the issuing office within 15 days. A change of motor need not be reported.

#### Hull Identification Number

Every boat manufactured in the U.S. (or imported) must have a hull identification number (hin). This currently consists of twelve characters, the first three of which are letters identifying the builder. Then follows a five-character serial number (which may contain letters), a letter and a number indicating the month and year of manufacture, and finally two digits indicating the model year.

The HIN must be on the starboard side of the transom, plus a hidden location within the hull.

#### Termination of Unsafe Use

The FBSA/71 also includes a provision that is unique to the general concept of boating laws and regulations: Termination of Unsafe Use. If a U.S. Coast Guard boarding officer observes a boat being used without sufficient lifesaving or fire-fighting devices, or in an overloaded or otherwise unsafe condition as defined in regulations, he may direct the operator to take immediate and reasonable steps necessary for the safety of those on board the vessel. This order may include directing the operator to return to shore or his mooring and remain there until the hazardous situation is corrected. Failure to comply with an order to terminate unsafe use of a vessel can result in arrest.

Federal regulations also designate certain “regulated navigation areas,” which include inlet bars along the coasts of Oregon and Washington. When wave heights or surface currents in such areas exceed set limits, the Coast Guard may prohibit boating until conditions improve.

The Coast Guard may also forbid use of a boat that is “manifestly unsafe for a specific voyage on a specific body of water.” This covers unsuitable design, improper construction or condition, or improper or inadequate operational or safety equipment.

#### Negligent Operation

The FBSA/71 states that no person may use any vessel “in a negligent manner so as to endanger the life, limb, or property of any person.” Foreign vessels, governmental vessels, and other craft normally excluded from coverage under this act are not exempted from the prohibition against negligent operations.

The endangerment of “any person” includes the operator of the vessel; no other person need be involved.

#### Boating Accidents

Sometimes of course, despite the best of care, boating accidents do occur. They may involve only a single boat, or two or more vessels. In all cases, skippers incur obligations at the scene and afterward.

Duties in Case of Accident In case of collision, accident, or other casualty involving a vessel subject to the FBSA/71 (as well as such otherwise exempted vessels as foreign or governmental craft), the operator must, to the extent that he can without serious danger to his vessel or those on board, render necessary and practical assistance to other persons endangered by the incident. The operator must also give his name and address, and the identification of his vessel, to any person injured and to the owner of any property damaged.

The duties described here apply whether or not the incident resulted from apparent negligence. They do not preclude any other duties required by law or regulation.

“Good Samaritan” Provision Any person who complies with the accident duties described above, or any other person who gratuitously and in good faith renders assistance at the scene of an accident or other boating casualty without the objection of any person being assisted, is protected by a provision of the FBSA/71. He cannot be held liable for any civil damages as a result of rendering assistance or for any act or omission in providing or arranging salvage, towage, medical treatment, or other assistance when he acts as an ordinary, reasonably prudent person would act under the same or similar circumstances.

Accident Reporting In case of collision, accident, or other casualty involving a vessel subject to the FBSA/71, the operator must make a report under certain circumstances. A report is required if the incident results in death, an injury requiring medical treatment beyond first aid, or the disappearance of a person from a vessel under circumstances that indicate death or injury. A report is also required if there is damage to vessels and other property that totals $2,000 or more, or complete loss of any vessel; see Figure 2-11.

Figure 2-11 Boating accidents must be reported if they involve death or personal injuries or physical damage that exceed specified limits. Accidents must be reported even if only one craft is involved. In most states, reports are made to state authorities rather than to the Coast Guard.

If death occurs within 24 hours of the accident, or a person has a reportable injury or disappears from the boat, a formal report must be made within 48 hours; otherwise, within 10 days.

Most state boating laws require that reports of boating accidents be made to a designated state office or official. If, however, there is no state provision for reporting such incidents, a report must be made to the U.S. Coast Guard Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, nearest the site of the accident.

U.S. Coast Guard regulations on accident reporting list the information that must be furnished. The Boating Accident Report—CG-3865—may be used in reports to the Coast Guard. States normally use this form or one of their own patterned after it; see Figure 2-12.

Figure 2-12 Use of a form like this one (or the Coast Guard’s six-page Recreational Boating Accident Form, CG-3865) ensures that an accident report contains all the required information.

Reporting requirements and forms are different for boats in commercial operation.

Accident Statistics The FBSA/71 also provides that as a part of an approved state registering and numbering system there shall be a casualty reporting plan in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary. Detailed procedures for recording, compiling, and forwarding statistics are set forth in Coast Guard regulations.

National Statistics The Coast Guard is in turn charged with the responsibility of combining state reports with its own, to form annual national statistics on the number of registered boats by classes; accidents by type, cause, surrounding circumstances, etc; and other related data.

Privacy of Information Information about the identity and ownership of vessels numbered under the act is made available to federal and local officials as needed in any enforcement or assistance program.

In general, files relating to boat numbering are considered “public records,” and information from them may be released to anyone, subject only to reasonable restrictions necessary to carry on the work of the records office.

On the other hand, individual “Boating Accident Reports” or extracts therefrom are not releasable. These are intended only to assist the Coast Guard in determining the cause of accidents and making recommendations for their prevention, and compiling appropriate statistics. The privacy of accident reports permits the filing of full and accurate reports without the contents being used against an individual in civil suits.

Safety Standards The FBSA/71 authorizes minimum safety standards for “boats” and “associated equipment.” Each standard must be reasonable, must meet the need for boating safety, and must be stated, insofar as practicable, in terms of performance. Under the act’s provisions, it is the responsibility of the manufacturer that all equipment on the boat when delivered meets any and all applicable safety standards of that date.

#### Penalties

The FBSA/71 provides for both civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions. It allows for variable penalties to meet situations of different degrees of seriousness, and provides for a flexible system of assessment and collection.

Civil Penalties A basic civil penalty of not more than $1,000 may be assessed for any violation of the FBSA/71 or any regulation issued thereunder. If the violation involves a vessel, that vessel may be liable and may be proceeded against in the U.S. federal courts. A civil penalty of not more than $200 may be assessed by administrative action; no trial is required, but procedures are established for appeals.

Criminal Penalties Any person who willfully uses a vessel in violation of the FBSA/71 or any regulation issued thereunder may be tried in court and fined up to $5,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. A person who uses a boat in a “grossly” negligent manner that endangers the life, limb, or property of a person is committing a class A misdemeanor. (“Simple” negligence is subject to civil penalties only.)

Penalty for Failure to Give Aid The person in charge of a vessel in a collision has duties to the other vessel and those aboard her. A skipper who fails to meet these responsibilities, without reasonable cause, may be found guilty of a misdemeanor and subjected to a fine of $1,000 or imprisonment for not more than two years, or both. The vessel may be proceeded against in federal court, with the penalty assessed being divided equally between any informer and the United States.

Penalty for Operation While Intoxicated Federal law now prescribes both civil and criminal penalties for operating a vessel while intoxicated. The civil penalty can be as much as $5,000. If one is tried in court and convicted, the penalty is that of a Class A misdemeanor. Intoxication includes both alcohol and drug abuse.

Many states have also adopted specific laws and penalties for operating a boat while “under the influence.” State penalties could include arrest, fines, and/or loss of motor vehicle driving privileges.

Written Warnings Coast Guard boarding officers may issue a written warning, intended to be educational rather than punitive, for certain minor violations of boating regulations. Citations, not written warnings, are issued for any violation involving danger to the occupants of a craft or when three or more violations of any type are found in a single boarding.

Written warnings are issued only for the first offense of any year; subsequent offenses are subject to more severe penalties. Appeal procedures are provided.

#### National Boating Safety Advisory Council

The FBSA/71 established the National Boating Safety Advisory Council (NBSAC) of 21 members, each of whom is expected to have special knowledge and experience in boating safety. The council consists equally of representatives from state and local governments, boat and associated equipment manufacturers, and boating organizations and the general public. All boating safety standards and other major safety matters are referred to the National Boating Safety Advisory Council before being issued.

##### HOMELAND SECURITY

For many decades, boaters have been using waters that included prohibited or restricted areas. These have included waters such as cable areas and pipeline areas where navigation was not restricted, but certain actions, such as anchoring, were prohibited. There were also danger areas, including waters where bombing or naval gunfire targets were located, and restricted or prohibited areas, generally established for the security of naval or other government facilities and property. Areas such as these might have full-time designation or be in effect only when announced specific activities are taking place. These are described in the various volumes of the Coast Pilot (refer to Chapter 15, this page) and are shown on the appropriate nautical charts, although without the details that are included in the Coast Pilot descriptions. Enforcement in many areas tended to be less than strict.

As an aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, a considerable number of new security areas and restrictions came into existence, and the number increases almost daily. To avoid getting into trouble with security authorities, it is imperative for every boater to know and comply with all restrictions on the waters on which he operates—enforcement is likely to be very active and strict.

###### Security & Protection Zones

Security zones are established around various onshore activities that might be a target for terrorist attack, typically all or a portion of a harbor or port, a major military or governmental facility, or a nuclear power plant. Temporary moving security zones may be established around cruise ships, vessels carrying “cargoes of particular interest,” typically those carrying hazardous liquids or gases, and other special vessels, usually when such vessels are entering port. Temporary fixed security zones are activated around these ships while they are berthed in port. Naval protection zones are always in effect around U.S. naval ships whether underway or in port—no entry within 100 yards, slow speed within 500 yards. Contact patrolling enforcement craft on VHF Channel 16 if you feel that you have to travel closer to the protected vessel, but do so before entering the restricted area.

###### Other Restricted Areas

Restricted areas with other names may be established where warranted. Restricted areas are established by the U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port for that vicinity in terms of specific geographic boundaries. In all cases, they are announced in the daily Federal Register. Sometimes there will be a preliminary notice of intent to establish such a zone, with a final rule and an effective date following later. At other times, the restrictions will be immediate. Changes may be made after initial establishment, and, in some few cases, restricted zones may be canceled.

###### Safety Zones

Temporary safety zones established for regattas, boat races, fireworks displays, etc., are distinct from the security actions described above, but boaters must be aware of these also and obey all restrictions.

###### Marine Sanctuaries

Although not ordinarily matters of national security, National marine sanctuaries are another type of water area having special operating rules and exclusion zones.

### Regattas & Marine Parades

The Coast Guard has established regulations for regattas and marine parades. In some areas the authority to regulate such events has been delegated to state authorities, but with the same general requirements and procedures.

The term “regattas and marine parades” includes all organized water events of limited duration conducted on a prearranged schedule; this covers races of all types.

An application must be submitted to the Commander of the Coast Guard District in which the event will be held at least 135 days in advance; late applications are normally rejected. The application must contain information as specified in Coast Guard regulations.

Approval is often followed, in turn, by “special local regulations” governing the conduct of the event, spectator craft restrictions, patrolling plans, etc. These are usually issued with Local Notices to Mariners (see Chapter 15, this page) and carry specific penalties for violation.

### Enforcement Authority

Federal boating regulations in general are enforced by the U.S. Coast Guard. USCG boarding vessels are identified by the U.S. Coast Guard ensign (see Chapter 25, this page) and uniformed personnel. Upon being hailed by a Coast Guard vessel or patrol boat, a vessel underway must stop immediately and lay to, or maneuver in such a way as to permit the boarding officer to come on board; a search warrant is not required.

Because of the many other missions assigned to the Coast Guard—drug and alien immigration interdiction, national security at ports, and others—recreational boaters are more likely to encounter enforcement by state and local patrol boats; see Figure 2-13. The Coast Guard made 440 RBS (Recreational Boating Safety) boardings in 2011, while the states collectively documented more than 1.5 million. Skippers should be alert for posted signs or regulatory buoys indicating speed limits, “no wake,” etc.

Figure 2-13 Boating laws and regulations are enforced afloat and ashore by many agencies—state and local police as well as the Coast Guard.

Nearly all law-enforcement vessels—U.S. Coast Guard and state or local—are equipped with a blue flashing light like those seen on police vehicles on land.

### Park Regulations

The use of boats on many natural lakes and man-made reservoirs is subject to regulations issued by the National Park Service or by state or local authorities. National parks, marine sanctuaries, and similar areas in coastal waters are also policed by the National Park Service. Each area must be individually checked by the boater to ensure that laws are not inadvertently violated.

## STATE BOATING LAWS & REGULATIONS

Federal laws and regulations preempt state controls for boat and equipment safety standards, but FBSA/71 does allow states to impose requirements for safety equipment beyond federal rules to meet uniquely hazardous local circumstances. Most or all states, for example, have laws and regulations relating to boat trailers and their use.

The old saying that “ignorance of the law is no excuse” applies to skippers of recreational boats. Each skipper should know the requirements and restrictions of the state in which he is boating. Information on applicable state laws and regulations may be obtained from each state, usually from the same office that handles registration and numbering.

The National Association of State Boating Law Administrators (NASBLA) is a national nonprofit organization representing the recreational boating authorities of all 50 states and the U.S. territories. NASBLA works to standardize state boating laws, regulations, license requirements, boater education and training, and marine law enforcement nationwide, and the Coast Guard works closely with NASBLA. See the NASBLA website at www.nasbla.org for more information and a searchable guide to state boating regulations.

## DOCUMENTATION

Not all boats are numbered—many are “documented.” This is a process whereby official papers on the craft are issued by the U.S. Coast Guard in much the same manner as for large ships. The numbering requirements of FBSA/71 do not apply to documented vessels; however, states may (and most do) require such craft to be registered, pay a fee, and display a sticker indicating that such fee has been paid. The other provisions of this act do apply to documented boats as defined therein.

Federal documentation is a form of national registration that serves to establish a vessel’s nationality, eligibility to engage in a particular employment (commercial vessels only), and eligibility to become the object of a preferred ship’s mortgage.

### Basic Requirements

For any vessel, commercial or yacht, to be documented it must measure at least five net tons (see this page, for definition of net tonnage). Very roughly, this corresponds to a boat of 25 feet (7.6 m) or more in length, but this will vary with the type of boat.

The vessel must be owned by a U.S. citizen; a partnership, trust, association, or joint venture, all of whose members are U.S. citizens; or a corporation meeting certain requirements of control by U.S. citizens. (Vessels owned by the federal or state governments may also be documented.) The captain and other officers, but not crewmen, of a commercially documented vessel must be U.S. citizens. Vessels documented exclusively for recreational purposes do not need to be under the command of a U.S. citizen.

Documentation of a craft used solely for recreation is optional, but vessels engaged in fisheries or coastwise trade must be documented. Vessels engaged in foreign trade are not required to be documented, but owners usually elect to be documented to gain the protection of the U.S. flag.

#### Types of Documents

A Certificate of Documentation, Form CG-1270, is issued for all types of vessels; see Figure 2-14. This common, basic form is endorsed for the authorized use or uses of the vessel—registry (for foreign trade), fisheries endorsement, coastwise license, or recreation. There may be more than one endorsement. Any commercially documented vessel may be used for recreation, but a vessel with only a recreational endorsement may not be used for any other purpose.

Figure 2-14 The Coast Guard issues Certificates of Documentation (Form CG-1270) for various types of vessel use, including recreation—the so-called “yacht” document.

#### Advantages of Documentation

Privileges extended by documentation of vessels include the privilege of recording bills of sale, mortgages, and other instruments of title for the vessel with federal officials at the National Vessel Documentation Center (NVDC), giving constructive legal notice to all persons of the effect of such instruments and permitting preferred status for mortgages so recorded. This gives additional security to the purchaser or mortgagee, and facilitates financing and transfer of title.

Documentation is not required for recreational craft, but it is advantageous for boats that cruise widely or spend major portions of the year in different states. Depending on the state’s law, it may eliminate any concern over “state of principal use.” Documentation will also be advantageous when entering foreign waters; it may even be a requirement for visiting some countries.

### Obtaining Documentation

Before a vessel can be documented, it must be measured for its tonnage and dimensions. (Admeasured is the more formal term, but it means the same and is gradually being dropped in favor of the simpler language.) Both gross and net tonnage must be determined.

#### Simplified Measurement

Any vessel under 79 feet (24.1 m) in length, a vessel of any length that is non-self-propelled, and a vessel of any length that is operated only for pleasure may be measured for tonnage under procedures that are far simpler than those required for larger vessels. In brief, this method uses the numerical product of three dimensions measured in feet: the length overall (LOA, or for these purposes, simply L), overall breadth (B), and depth (D). Measurements are in feet and inches (to the nearest inch) or in feet and tenths of feet.

As defined earlier, length overall is the horizontal distance between the outer side of the foremost part (bow) of the hull and the outer side of the aftermost part (stern) of the hull. It does not include bowsprits, rudders, outboard motor brackets, swim platforms that do not contain buoyant volume, and other similar fittings and attachments that are not a part of the buoyant hull.

Breadth is the horizontal distance taken at the widest part of the hull, excluding rub rails, from the outside of the “skin” on one side of the hull to the outside of the skin on the other side of the hull.

Depth is not the same as “draft.” It is the vertical distance taken at or near amidships from a line drawn horizontally through the uppermost edges of the skin at the sides of the hull (excluding any caprail, trunk cabin, deckhouse, or deck caps) to the outer face of the bottom of the hull excluding the keel. For sailboats lacking a clearly defined interface between the “bottom of the hull” and the “keel” (as is the case with an “integral” or “faired” keel), include the keel in the depth measurement.

The gross tonnage of a catamaran or trimaran (defined as having no buoyant volume in the structure that connects the hulls together) is determined by adding the gross tonnages for each hull as calculated above. Cathedral-hull forms and other similar configurations with no distinct separation of the hulls are not considered multihulls in this context. Where the volume of the deckhouse is disproportionate to the volume of the hull—as in some designs of houseboats—the volume of the deckhouse is calculated by appropriate geometric formulas.

If the vessel is new, the dimensions discussed above are entered by the manufacturer in Part III of a Builder’s Certification and First Transfer of Title, Form CG-1261, for initial documentation only. Otherwise, the owner enters the dimensions in an Application for Simplified Measurement, Form CG-5397. The appropriate form is submitted to the NVDC together with the Application for Documentation as described below. The NVDC will calculate the gross tonnage and net tonnage from this data.

The gross tonnage of a vessel designed for sailing is assumed to be 0.5 (LBD/100); for vessels not designed for sailing it is calculated to be 0.67 (LBD/100).

The net tonnage of a sailing vessel is recorded as 9/10 of the gross tonnage; for a nonsailing vessel, the multiplying factor is 8/10. If there is no propelling machinery in the hull, the net tonnage will be the same as the gross tonnage.

Form CG-5397 can be obtained from the Tonnage Division, Marine Safety Center, U.S. Coast Guard Stop 7430, 2703 Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue SE, Washington, DC 20593-7430, telephone 202-795-6729. Downloadable forms for interactive completion or printing can be found online at www.uscg.mil/nvdc. The form contains complete instructions, and much other information can also be found at this site, including all required forms. The owner can take his own measurements. Certain novel or unique craft cannot be identified or categorized in the types described on Form CG-5397. In such cases, follow the instructions at the Internet site or on the reverse side of the form.

#### Formal Measurement

The owner of a boat may elect to have formal measurement rather than use the simplified method. This is required if the vessel measures 79 feet (24.1 m) or more in length, except for certain inland barges and recreational vessels operating only on the Great Lakes.

If an owner is contemplating formal measurement, it is suggested that he first estimate the tonnage by using the simplified method. If the resulting net tonnage is less than 5 tons the vessel will probably be under 5 net tons when formally measured, and thus not eligible for documentation.

The U.S. Coast Guard has delegated the function of formal measurement of vessels to several classification societies. Names, addresses, and contact information on each of these can be obtained from the USCG Tonnage Division as listed above.

Fees will be charged for the measurement of each vessel, and for the issuance of a measurement certificate. Owners can typically expect to pay on the order of several hundred to several thousand dollars to have a vessel formally measured, depending on vessel size, location, first-of-a-kind, etc. After requesting reconsideration of the decision or action by the classification society performing the tonnage measurement, a formal appeal may be filed, via the classification society headquarters, to the Coast Guard.

#### Application for Document

The vessel owner must submit an Application for Documentation, Form CG-1258. This two-sided form is also used for changes in an existing document; an instruction sheet is available. (Some of the “instructions” are references to sections of the Code of Federal Regulations, but in general the form is simple to complete.) This form, and CG-5397 if applicable, should be sent to the National Vessel Documentation Center, 792 T J Jackson Drive, Falling Waters, WV 25419-4527; telephone 800-799-8362. Forms and general information can be obtained online at www.uscg.mil/nvdc. Forms are also available by fax 24 hours a day. Simply telephone the 800 number and follow the prompts. If you don’t have a fax machine available, you may leave a voice-mail message specifying the address to which you want the forms sent.

The application for documentation must include a name for the vessel composed of letters of the Latin alphabet or Arabic or Roman numerals and may not exceed 33 characters. The name, which must be approved by the Coast Guard, cannot be identical, actually or phonetically, to any word or words used to solicit assistance at sea and cannot contain or be phonetically identical to obscene, indecent, or profane language or to racial or ethnic epithets. Once established, a vessel’s name cannot be changed without application, fees, and the consent of the Director, National Vessel Documentation Center. The hailing port must be in the United States and must include the state, territory, or possession in which it is located.

When the application form is received by the Documentation Center, an official number will be assigned to the vessel. Although a vessel’s name may be changed with appropriate permission, the official number will remain unchanged for the life of the vessel. The owner must have the vessel properly marked as described below.

If the vessel is new, evidence of the facts of construction must be submitted on a Builder’s Certification, Form CG-1261, or on another original document executed by a person who constructed the vessel, supervised the construction of the vessel, or is an officer or employee of the company that built the vessel and has examined the records concerning the facts of the build of the vessel.

If documentation for recreational use is sought for a used vessel for the first time, the owner has the option of presenting evidence of the complete chain of ownership or merely a copy of the last prior registration (foreign, federal, or state) plus evidence that establishes title from that registration to the present owner.

#### Fees

There are several fees to be paid for the documentation process—initial issuance, commercial endorsement (but not for a recreational endorsement), duplicate for a lost certificate, recording bills of sale and mortgages, etc. These fees vary and generally slowly increase. The fee for an initial certificate of documentation was $133 as of 2020; the fee for a return to documentation was $84.

### Markings of a Documented Vessel

U.S. Coast Guard regulations prescribe precisely how a documented vessel must be marked. Documented vessels do not display their official numbers on the outside of the hull, but are identified by the name and hailing port. A General Information Sheet is sent with each new Certificate of Documentation; it includes clear and exact instructions for the application of the required markings.

#### Official Number

The official number assigned to a documented vessel, preceded by the abbreviation “No.,” must be marked by a permanent method in block-type Arabic numerals at least three inches high on some clearly visible interior structural part of the hull. The number must be permanently affixed so that alteration, removal, or replacement would be obvious and cause some scarring or damage to the surrounding hull area; see Figure 2-15.

Figure 2-15 A documented craft must have its official number permanently marked in Arabic numerals on a clearly visible interior member of the vessel.

#### Name & Hailing Port

The vessel name and hailing port of a recreational vessel must be marked together on some clearly visible exterior part of the hull; see Figure 2-16. The vessel name of a commercial vessel must be marked on the port and starboard bow, and the vessel’s name and hailing port must be marked on the stern. All markings may be made by any means and materials that result in durable markings and must be at least four inches in height, made in clearly legible letters of the Latin alphabet or Arabic or Roman numerals. The “hailing port” must include both a place and a state, territory, or possession of the United States. The state may be abbreviated, but not any part of the name of the city.

Figure 2-16 A documented boat used for recreation purposes only must have its name and hailing port marked on some conspicuous part of its hull; this is normally done on the transom. The state must be shown as well as the city, and only the state name can be abbreviated.

The name and port of a vessel must be on the vessel itself. Displaying the name and port on the bottom of a dinghy carried awarthship on its side across a boat’s transom, as is sometimes done, is not a legally acceptable substitute for markings on the documented craft itself, but can be additionally done if the dinghy obscures the name on the transom.

The vessel name and/or hailing port may be changed by filing an application for change on Form CG-1258 with the appropriate fees. If your vessel is subject to a mortgage of record, you must obtain permission from the mortgagee (the lender) on Form CG-4593.

A Certificate of Documentation is not valid until the vessel is properly marked. The penalty for operation of a vessel with an invalid document is $15,000 per violation, and each day of such operation is a separate violation.

#### Renewal of Document

A Certificate of Documentation for a commercial vessel is valid for one year from the date of issue, providing there are no changes other than a change of owner’s address, which must be reported to the NVDC within 10 days. The certificate must be renewed on an annual basis, and the Coast Guard will send a Notice of Renewal approximately 45 days prior to expiration. The one-year term and fee applied equally to recreational vessels until recently. Starting in 2022, however, following a five-year phase-in, the term for a recreational certificate is 5 years and the fee is $26 per year.

It is not necessary to send back the Certificate of Documentation; simply sign, date, and return the Renewal Notice, even if your address has changed. Please note any address change. You will receive a new Certificate of Documentation upon renewal.

If you do not receive a renewal form, you should contact the NVDC not less than two weeks prior to the expiration date. The responsibility for renewal is placed on the vessel owner, whether or not a notice is received from the Documentation Center.

#### Sale of a Documented Vessel

If your boat is documented and you sell it, return the original Certificate of Documentation to the NVDC along with a brief note that you sold the vessel. Your certificate is nontransferable and should not be given to the new owner unless you have sold the boat by completing the reverse side. Alternatively, when the sale is finalized you can complete a U.S. Coast Guard Bill of Sale (CG-1340) that can be used by the new owner should he wish to document the vessel. Documentation requires that the new owner send in the Certificate of Documentation completed on the reverse side, or a signed original Bill of Sale with an Application for Documentation (CG-1258) and fees. The buyer should also be able to use the Bill of Sale form as evidence of the transfer of ownership to obtain state registration and/or title if he chooses not to document the vessel with the U.S. Coast Guard.

If you have an outstanding mortgage of record against your vessel, make sure the mortgagee (the lender) completes a Satisfaction of Mortgage form and mails an original and one copy to the NVDC. Your vessel cannot be removed from documentation with an outstanding mortgage.

Other reasons requiring the surrender of a Certificate of Documentation include: (1) a change in the name of the vessel; (2) a change in ownership, such as the death of a listed owner; (3) a change in the tonnage of the vessel.

#### Use of Documented Boats

The person in command of a documented vessel must keep the original copy of the Certificate of Documentation on board to be produced upon the demand of any person acting in an official capacity. This does not apply to non-self-propelled vessels not engaged in foreign trade, or if the Certificate of Documentation has been submitted to the NVDC for exchange, or if the vessel is in storage or out of the water. A document for recreational use does not permit the transporting of merchandise or the carrying of passengers for hire (see below), such as taking out fishing parties for a fee charged directly or indirectly. Any violation of this limitation may result in severe penalties against the craft and its owner, including forfeiture of the vessel. See also the Commercial Operation section immediately below.

The documentation of a vessel for recreational use does not exempt it from any applicable state or federal taxes. Further, the fact that a boat is federally documented will not excuse the owner from complying with safety and equipment regulations of the state or states in which it is operated. State and local officials have the right to board a documented vessel for law enforcement purposes.

Vessels that are documented are not required to have a number issued under FBSA/71. However, in many states, these craft must be registered and the same tax or fee paid as if they were to be numbered. A documented vessel may not display a state number, but it may display a state registration validation sticker. Contact the appropriate state office in your area for further information.

## COMMERCIAL OPERATION

The dividing line between noncommercial (recreational) and commercial operation of a boat may seem obvious, but a boat owner who is unfamiliar with federal regulations can get into difficulties. The amateur skipper may conclude that his activities are in no sense commercial and that guests on board are not passengers for hire. However, there are circumstances in which authorities would disagree. A recreational boat operator who crosses the legal line may be subject to fines and may not be covered by his insurance.

This confusion exists in part because the FBSA/71 definition of a passenger included any guest who has not contributed any consideration for his carriage, whereas PVSA/93 subsequently amended the definition of passenger and added new definitions of passenger for hire and consideration.

### Carrying Passengers for Hire

Persons who operate a motorboat carrying passengers for hire must have a license, the category of which is determined by the number of persons carried and the size of the vessel.

Definition of “Passenger” Of particular interest to boaters who use their craft exclusively for recreation is the definition of a “passenger” in PVSA/93. Any persons on board a vessel are considered by law to be passengers if they are not any of the following: (1) the owner or his/her representative; (2) the operator; (3) bona fide members of the crew who have contributed no consideration for their carriage and who are paid for their services.

When Is a Boat Carrying Passengers for Hire? It is important that a skipper understand the circumstances that might be considered by authorities as “carrying passengers for hire.” Some situations are obvious—such as taking one or more persons on a fishing trip in exchange for a payment from each individual or from the group as a whole—but other cases are less clear cut. Confusion arises when guests contribute toward the expenses of a recreational and social outing. The old regulations under FBSA/71 failed to define “consideration,” and local Coast Guard offices interpreted the regulations on a case-by-case basis.

The newer PVSA/93 definitions eliminate that confusion, defining a passenger for hire as a passenger who contributes a consideration as a condition of carriage on the vessel, whether directly or indirectly flowing to the owner, charterer, operator, agent, or other person having an interest in the vessel. A consideration is an economic benefit, inducement, right, or profit (including a payment of money) accruing to an individual or entity, but a voluntary sharing of the expenses of a voyage by a monetary contribution or by a donation in kind of fuel, food, beverages, or other supplies is not treated as a consideration.

Under these rules, several couples or friends may chip in to pay for fuel, food, beverages, and other expenses for a day’s outing or cruise without becoming “passengers for hire.” In all other situations, where there is consideration for passage, the craft is considered to be operating commercially and must be operated by someone holding an appropriate U.S. Coast Guard license.

#### License for Six or Fewer Passengers

Self-propelled vessels of less than 100 gross tons carrying not more than six passengers for hire must be “under the direction and control of” a properly licensed person. This Coast Guard license is officially titled Operator of Uninspected Passenger Vessels (OUPV). More commonly, it is called a “six-pack” license. These OUPV licenses are issued for inland, Great Lakes, or near-coastal waters (not more than 100 miles offshore).

Application for an OUPV License Licenses are issued by Officers in Charge (OIC), Marine Inspection, U.S. Coast Guard at Regional Examination Centers. Traveling Examination Teams may visit other ports or make specific trips to give examinations to groups of applicants. Much processing of applications for original licenses and renewals can be done by mail or on the Internet; contact the nearest OIC, Marine Inspection for details. A packet of instructions to guide prospective applicants normally accompanies the application form. These instructions must be followed exactly, or the application may be denied.

An applicant for an OUPV license must be 18 years of age; he or she must be able to speak and understand English as used in boating (except for licenses limited to Puerto Rico and vicinity, where Spanish may be substituted). Use of dangerous drugs or conviction of drug-law violations may be a bar to issuance of a license. Fingerprints will be taken and checked. Individuals must be citizens of the United States, except that a non-citizen may receive an OUPV license limited to nondocumented vessels.

Except for special limited licenses (see next page), an applicant for an OUPV license must submit proof of 360 days’ experience in the operation of vessels, at least 90 days of which must have been in the last 3 years. (The Coast Guard says that a “day” requires at least 4 hours of operation.) If the license is for near-coastal waters, 90 days of the service must have been on ocean or near-coastal waters. An applicant must submit written recommendations from three persons who have knowledge of his or her ability to carry out the duties of this type of license.

Applicants for an original license must present evidence of successful completion of one of several first-aid courses within the past 12 months, plus a currently valid certificate of completion of a cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) course. CPR certification is not required for renewals.

Physical Fitness Required Applicants must submit a U.S. Coast Guard physical examination form or equivalent, signed by a licensed medical doctor, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, or medical examiner within the past 12 months. Visual acuity and color vision requirements are very specific, but waivers can be requested for special circumstances.

Mandatory Drug Testing The Coast Guard has established a comprehensive, mandatory drug-testing program for crews of marine vessels. All licensed crewmembers are subject to the program if they are required to be on board because of the nature of the vessel’s operation, such as boats carrying passengers for hire. Unlicensed personnel are also subject to testing if they are involved in the craft’s operation.

The actual drug test (urine or blood) must be taken under five conditions: (1) pre-employment; (2) reasonable cause; (3) after a serious marine accident; (4) whenever a physical examination is required, such as original applications and renewal, and some upgrades; or (5) random testing. Detailed procedures have been set up for the collection of samples, analysis, review of results, reporting, and maintenance of records.

The program primarily focuses on commercially employed mariners and large ships, but it does include self-employed individuals and recreational boaters who hold a U.S. Coast Guard license without using it for employment. Skippers in these categories should get full details from a Coast Guard Marine Inspection office or Regional Examination Center.

Examination An applicant for a license as an Operator of Uninspected Passenger Vessels must pass a written examination. Subjects covered will be applicable to the waters concerned and may include navigation rules, chart reading and piloting; magnetic compass principles and use; tide and tidal current calculations; vessel handling, such as docking and undocking, anchoring, and in heavy weather; fire fighting and other emergency actions; first aid; rules and regulations for uninspected vessels; pollution rules and vessel sanitation laws; radiotelephone communications; and “any other subject considered necessary to establish the applicant’s proficiency.”

Re-examination All examinations are administered at periodic intervals. If an applicant fails three or more sections of the exam (which has four sections), a complete re-examination must be taken, but this may be done at any scheduled exam session. On the re-exam, if three or more sections are failed, at least 3 months must pass before any further retesting.

If one or two sections are failed, the applicant can be re-examined twice on these sections during the next 3 months. If these are not passed in that time period, at least 3 months must pass from the date of the last retest, and a complete re-examination must be taken.

License Issuance and Renewal Licenses are issued by an OIC, Marine Inspection. Every license must also be signed by the person to whom it is issued. It is valid for 5 years, after which it can be renewed. There are fees for the application for a license and for the examination. There are also expenses involved in the physical examination and the drug testing; there may be fees connected with the first aid course and the CPR training.

A license can be renewed in person at any Regional Examination Center, or by mail to the center that issued it. The original license (or photocopy) must be presented together with a completed application form. Evidence must be presented of at least one year of service (360 days) under the license during the past 5 years, or a comprehensive open-book exercise must be passed.

A license can be renewed up to 12 months after its expiration date, but it is not valid for use within this grace period. After 12 months it cannot be renewed and must be reissued; the individual will be examined to establish continued professional knowledge.

No license will be renewed if it has been suspended without probation, has been revoked, or if facts have come to the attention of the Coast Guard indicating that renewal would be improper.

Limited OUPV Licenses Limited OUPV licenses may be issued to employees of organizations such as formal camps, yacht clubs, marinas, and educational institutions. The experience requirement is reduced to 90 days in the type of vessel to be used, and the applicant must have a completion certificate from an approved course, such as those given by the U.S. Power Squadrons or U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary. A limited examination appropriate to the activity to be engaged in and the area concerned is required.

Lost License If a license is lost, this fact must be reported to an OIC, Marine Inspection. A duplicate license may be issued after an application and affidavit concerning the loss are submitted and issuance of the lost license has been confirmed. This is for the unexpired term of the lost license.

Suspension or Revocation If any license holder is found guilty of incompetence, misconduct, negligence, endangering life, or willfully violating any safety law or regulation, his or her license may be suspended or revoked. The license may also be revoked if the holder is convicted of violating a dangerous-drug law or is shown to be a user of, or addicted to, a dangerous drug. The license must then be surrendered, but a certificate will be issued covering the period during which any appeal is pending.

#### Licenses for More Than Six Passengers

Operation of small craft carrying more than six passengers for hire—“small passenger vessels”—requires a license as Master of Steam or Motor Vessels. This will usually be for not more than 100 gross tons, but may be for not more than 50 gross tons if the person’s experience is on vessels of that size; see Figure 2-17. The license will be further designated as near-coastal, inland, or Great Lakes; near-coastal is defined as not more than 200 miles offshore.

Figure 2-17 Licenses for the master or mate of a vessel carrying passengers for hire are issued in terms of the maximum tonnage of the vessel concerned, its type, and the waters for which the license is valid. A recreational boater having such a license can often negotiate lower boat insurance premiums.

The required experience is 2 years of service in the deck department of ocean or near-coastal vessels. In order to get an endorsement for sail or auxiliary sail vessels, the individual must submit evidence of 360 days’ service on such craft; this service may have been prior to the issuance of the license.

The physical and vision requirements are the same as discussed above for OUPV licenses. Examination subjects are expanded to cover the larger size of vessels involved.

For larger craft, there is a license level of Not More Than 200 Gross Tons with both Master and Mate categories, and Ocean as well as the other geographic limitations.

Any license issued for inland waters is valid for all inland waters of the United States, excluding the Great Lakes. A license issued for the Great Lakes is also valid for inland waters. A license for near-coastal waters is also valid for the Great Lakes and all inland waters. A license as Master or Mate is valid for the operation of uninspected passenger vessels (six or fewer passengers).

The term of the licenses, and the requirements and procedures for renewal, are the same as for OUPV licenses.

#### Licenses for Towing

The Coast Guard issues licenses for Master or Mate (Pilot) of uninspected towing vessels. A special endorsement is required for “Assistance Towing.”

#### Vessel Inspection

Vessels carrying more than six passengers for hire must be inspected by an OIC, Marine Inspection. These are among the vessels generally referred to in U.S. Coast Guard regulations as “inspected vessels” and “small passenger vessels”; ordinary motorboats are categorized as “uninspected vessels.”

Certificates of Inspection describe the area in which the vessel may operate, the maximum number of passengers that may be carried, the minimum crew required, and the minimum lifesaving and fire-fighting equipment to be on board, etc. Certificates are valid for 3 years.

## CHARTERING

The act of renting a boat is termed chartering, except for runabouts and waterskiing boats hired on an hourly or daily basis.

As a boater, you may decide that you want to charter another person’s vessel, or you may want your boat to earn her own keep when you won’t be using her. We will consider these two situations separately.

### Chartering Another Person’s Boat

If you have time for no boating activities at all except for a few vacation weeks each year, it may not make good economic sense to own and maintain your own boat for such limited use. Or you may have thoroughly explored the areas accessible to you with your own boat, and want to try areas farther away. In either case, chartering is the way to go. Charters of both power and sailing vessels are available in almost all boating areas. Most charters begin and end at the same port, but some can be set up to cruise from “here” to “there” one-way.

Crewed or Bareboat Your charter can be either crewed or bareboat. Crewed means that the vessel’s owner furnishes a captain—and often a mate/cook—who retains all responsibilities for the operation of the boat. You and your family or friends are “guests” aboard and have few responsibilities. You and your party may participate in the sailing and navigation activities if you like, but always under the supervision of the captain, who is often the vessel’s owner.

On the other hand, a bareboat charter appeals to those who want to handle the boat themselves, without paid crew.

Crewed charters normally include all provisions and supplies. Bareboat charters may or may not include food and beverages, or these may be available at an additional fee (this is recommended as it permits you to get underway without delay). The charter agreement states exactly what is supplied by the owner, plus his responsibilities as charterer as well as yours.

### Chartering Your Boat

If you want to charter your own boat, you can do this directly, but most owners will work through an agent or broker. Any chartering must be under a written agreement. If you charter directly, the charter agreement form should be examined by a lawyer qualified and experienced in such matters. With an agent or broker, you can get customers more easily and be free from much paperwork, and you’ll also know that the charter is being handled legally and efficiently. You will probably also need guidance about charges for the basic charter and for the optional services. You can get help from a professional agent or broker, but you do not need to give him an exclusive hold on your boat.

Check Your Insurance Before making even the first move toward chartering your boat, check your insurance policy. It most likely prohibits chartering, but the restriction can be removed with an endorsement, which requires the payment of an additional premium. You may also want to increase your liability coverage under these new circumstances.

Licenses & Regulations If you are going to captain your boat while chartering, you will be “carrying passengers for hire.” In U.S. waters this will require a U.S. Coast Guard license of the proper type for the waters used, the type and size of vessel, and the number of passengers carried. If you plan to carry more than six guests, your boat must be inspected by the Coast Guard and meet much more stringent requirements than for your own use or when carrying six or fewer passengers; see this page. In the waters of other nations, the requirements may vary, and there may be restrictions as to citizenship; check carefully.

Tax Aspects of Chartering The income and expenses of operating a boat for charter will materially affect your income tax status. Check appropriate government publications and seek professional advice.

## INTERNATIONAL VOYAGES

When an American boat crosses the national boundaries of the United States to visit a foreign port, or a foreign yacht visits an American port, certain customs, immigration, and other regulations must be obeyed. As a result of various provisions and exemptions applying to recreational boats, the procedure has been simplified and will not interfere with the pleasures of a foreign cruise. There are severe penalties, however, for any failure to observe the regulations that do apply.

### Clearing & Entering

The terms clearing and entering are commonly used in connection with a vessel’s voyage between ports of two nations. Clearing involves obtaining permission to sail by presenting the ship’s papers to a customs official. Entering relates to arrival, when the owner or master “enters” his vessel by having his ship’s papers accepted by customs authorities. Thus a U.S. vessel might be required to clear from an American port and enter on arrival at a foreign port.

If desired, bills of health may be secured free of charge before leaving for a foreign port. This is not compulsory, but may make entry into the foreign port quicker and easier. Cruisers who plan to travel outside U.S. waters should check with their local health department or a travel agency for information on any inoculations or vaccinations required by specific countries.

Exemptions for Noncommercial Craft Neither a documented vessel with a recreational endorsement nor an undocumented American recreational vessel (not engaged in trade nor in any way violating the customs or navigation laws of the U.S.) is required to clear customs upon departure from the United States for a foreign port or place (with some specific exceptions, such as going to Cuba). Similarly a documented vessel with a recreational endorsement of any size or an undocumented American recreational vessel (not engaged in trade nor in any way violating the customs or navigation laws of the U.S., and not having visited any other vessel “hovering” off the coast, and not having received merchandise while in the customs waters beyond the territorial waters or on the high seas) is exempted from formal entry. The vessel’s captain must, however, immediately report the vessel’s arrival to Customs or to an alternative entity designated by the port director.

#### Report on Arrival

There are four separate legal aspects to entering a country from a foreign nation, each involving its own government agency and officials. These are (1) Customs, relating to bringing in dutiable merchandise; (2) Immigration, related to persons’ eligibility for entry; (3) Public Health Service, for preventing importation of human diseases; and (4) Animal and Plant Quarantine, for preventing entry of contaminated plants, fruits, and vegetables, or infected animals.

On arrival from a foreign port, the owner or captain of a recreational boat should report to the authorities mentioned above, or to such of them as exist for that port. The Q flag (plain yellow) should be flown where it can be easily seen—starboard spreader, radio antenna, fishing outrigger, etc.—to indicate that the vessel desires to be boarded by customs and other governmental authorities; see Figure 2-18. When reporting, the captain may go ashore, if required, to report to the applicable authorities; crew and guests must remain aboard until permission has been granted to land. Any additional or local regulations to be complied with, including details in connection with clearing from that port, will be supplied by the authorities.

Figure 2-18 Any boat arriving in a United States port from a foreign country must hoist a plain yellow flag—the letter “Q” of the International Code Flag set—when entering U.S. territorial waters and keep it flying until U.S. Customs and Immigration clearances have been completed.

Every vessel, whether documented or not, arriving in the United States from a foreign port or place must come into a port where the formality of entry can be accomplished; the Q flag should be hoisted upon entering U.S. waters, 12 miles offshore. Only one person may get off the boat for the sole purpose of notifying the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) of the Department of Homeland Security regarding the vessel’s arrival in port; no baggage or other cargo should be removed before a CBP officer has given specific approval.

All boats, regardless of size, must report to CBP authorities on return to the United States. Pleasure vessels 30 feet or longer must display a cruising fee decal, which may be purchased through the CBP website: www.CBP.gov. The annual fee as of early 2017 was $27.50. This requirement applies equally to visiting foreign yachts and to returning U.S. boats.

Any aliens on board must be reported and a heavy penalty may be imposed for failure to detain them if ordered to do so by CBP.

Following the 9/11 terrorist attack, security was greatly tightened. All persons on a boat coming from a foreign nation were required to appear in person before a CBP officer. This often meant taking a taxi or other transportation to an airport or commercial port. In areas such as South Florida, where many boats return from foreign waters daily, near-chaos developed. To ease this situation, CBP developed the Local Boater Option program that allows the preregistration of vessels and individuals with a single visit to CBP. This is designed for low-risk boat owners who cruise frequently outside U.S. waters, such as from Florida to the Bahamas. Boaters still have to phone in to the CBP when they return to the U.S., but they don’t have to report for a face-to-face inspection. The Local Boater Option started in Miami, Tampa, and San Juan and is being rolled out to other major boating communities.

Other programs that do not require face-to-face inspections include NEXUS, the Canadian Border Boat Landing Permit, and Outlying Area Reporting Stations (OARS).

NEXUS is designed for boaters who travel frequently back and forth between the U.S. and Canada, and boaters still must phone in to CBP to clear customs back in the U.S. The NEXUS permit is good for five years. The Canadian Border Boat Landing Permit, also called I-68, is valid for a boating season. Applicants are inspected and issued an I-68 permit; as of early 2017, the fee is $16 for an individual or $32 for a family. Each member of a family 14 years and older must complete a separate three-page form, available only at the issuing point of entry. People who are not U.S. citizens may use Form I-68 for visits up to 72 hours within 25 miles of the shoreline along the U.S.-Canada border. If you don’t have a Form I-68 to enter the U.S., you must report in person at the port of entry or use one of the OARS videophones, connected to the CBP, at facilities near the border, usually public marinas.

Additional Information In general, customs duties are assessed on articles of foreign manufacture when they are brought into the United States if the total value of items purchased exceeds a specified amount, which varies with the length of time that the individual has been out of the U.S. and where they were bought. If you have purchased a foreign-made camera, radio, etc., in the United States and then took it with you when cruising outside U.S. waters, you would not be liable for any duty payment on return. It’s a good idea to register such items with U.S. customs before leaving the country.

## FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION LAWS

There are a number of basic laws covering water pollution, including the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 as amended and extended by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 and the Clean Water Act of 1977. There have been additional minor revisions over the years. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 covers spills of petroleum products of all types. These laws cover far more than discharges from boats and other vessels, but they form the basis for all implementing standards and regulations by the U.S. Coast Guard, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and other federal agencies.

### Discharge of Sewage

The term sewage is defined as human body wastes and the wastes from toilets and other receptacles intended to receive or retain body waste. The term marine sanitation device (MSD) includes any equipment for installation on board a vessel which is designed to receive, retain, treat, or discharge sewage, and any process to treat such sewage. No untreated sewage may be discharged overboard in any waters subject to the federal laws and regulations. Treated sewage may be pumped overboard except as noted next.

#### Basic Provisions

The current laws and regulations relate to all watercraft. The law does, however, permit enforcing authorities to distinguish among classes, types, and sizes of vessels, as well as between new and existing vessels. There are provisions for waivers, but it has been officially stated that very few waivers may be expected and only on the strongest justification for each situation. Initially phased in over several years, the federal requirements are now applicable to all boats regardless of date of construction.

Performance Standards The general approach of the federal pollution legislation is the establishment of “standards of performance” for marine sanitation devices. The law states that performance standards must be consistent with maritime safety standards and marine laws and regulations. It specifically notes that in the development of standards consideration must be given to “the economic costs involved” and “the available limits of technology.”

#### Operational Requirements

Present regulations divide waters into two categories: (1) freshwater lakes and reservoirs that have no navigable inlet or outlet, and (2) other waters, including coastal waters and tributary rivers, the Great Lakes, and freshwater bodies accessible through locks. Freshwater bodies in the first category above are subject to “no discharge’ ” rules. In the second category, the regulations also contain a provision that a state can apply for the establishment of a “no discharge zone.” This is usually related to shellfish harvesting areas and public beaches, and the state must certify that there are adequate pump-out facilities to meet the needs of local and cruising boats. This provision is being implemented with increasing frequency. It should be noted, however, that craft equipped with a discharge-type MSD may be used on “no discharge” waters provided the device “has been secured so as to prevent discharge.”

Marine sanitation devices are grouped into several “types”—such as I, II, or III—based on how sewage is treated or retained on board. For more on these devices, see this page.

Vessel Requirements All vessels, including boats, with installed toilet facilities must have an operable marine sanitation device. Craft smaller than 65 feet (19.8 m) in length may have a Type I, II, or III MSD labeled as certified; larger vessels must have a Type II or III MSD.

Enforcement The law specifically authorizes U.S. Coast Guard and other enforcement personnel to board and inspect any vessel upon the navigable waters of the United States to check compliance with these provisions.

The Coast Guard has stated as a general policy that its units will not board vessels solely to check for the absence of a legal MSD. They will, however, make such an inspection whenever a boat is boarded for any other reason. Thus if your craft is boarded for a minor safety violation—such as improper navigation lights or suspected overloading—or as a routine procedure after receiving Coast Guard assistance, you can expect to be cited if you are not in compliance with the MSD requirements.

### Disposal of Trash & Garbage

The U.S. Coast Guard has issued regulations to implement Annex V of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, commonly known as Annex V of MARPOL 73/78. They apply to all U.S. vessels (including boats) wherever they operate (except waters under the exclusive jurisdiction of a state) and to foreign vessels operating in U.S. waters out to and including the Exclusive Economic Zone (200 nautical miles).

The regulations impose stringent requirements on the overboard disposal of trash and garbage, especially plastic items. The discharge of all garbage is totally prohibited in the Great Lakes and their connecting or tributary waters.

#### The Terminology of Garbage

Plastic includes, but is not limited to, plastic bags, Styrofoam cups and lids, six-pack holders, bottles, caps, buckets, shoes, milk jugs, egg cartons, stirrers, straws, synthetic ropes, and bio- or photo-degradable plastics.

Garbage means paper, rags, glass, metal, crockery (generated in the living spaces on board the vessel—what we normally call “trash”) and all kinds of food, cargo, and maintenance waste. Garbage does not include fresh fish or fish parts, dishwater, blackwater, or graywater (see below).

Dishwater means the liquid residue from the manual or automatic washing of dishes and cooking utensils that have been precleaned to the extent that any food particles adhering to them would not normally interfere with the operation of automatic dishwashers.

Graywater means drainage from a dishwasher, shower, laundry, bath or washbasin, but does not include drainage from toilets, urinals, hospitals, and cargo spaces.

Dunnage is material used to block and brace cargo—and is considered a cargo-associated waste.

#### Prohibited Actions

Boaters must learn and observe the various disposal prohibitions, especially the total ban on overboard disposal of plastic items in all waters, inland and offshore at any distance. They must learn and conform to the regulations regarding the disposal of other garbage; the restrictions gradually lessen with distance from shore; see Figure 2-19. For example, the rules make it illegal within 3 nautical miles of the shore to operate a garbage disposal in a galley if it discharges overboard. To make it easier to comply with the regulations, skippers may want to separate garbage according to the disposal limitations.

Figure 2-19 International treaties and U.S. Coast Guard regulations establish zones for various distances offshore in which the dumping overboard of specific kinds of material is prohibited.

Skippers must inform crewmembers and passengers of these rules and the penalties for their violation.

Placards On craft 26 feet (7.9 m) or more in length, informational placards must be posted (see Figure 2-20); depending upon the size of the vessel, more than one may be required. These placards must define the limitations placed on discharging garbage in the marine environment and specify the fines and other penalties that could be assessed for violation. Such placards must measure at least 8 inches wide and 5 inches high; they must be of durable material with letters at least ⅛ inch high. Placards that meet these specifications are available at marine stores for a small cost.

Figure 2-20 All boats 26 feet (7.9 m) or more in length must have one or more placards posted that specify what cannot be dumped overboard at various distances from the coast. These placards of a standard minimum size may be purchased at marine supply stores.

Vessels used exclusively on the Great Lakes may use the standard placard described above or a placard that states “The discharge of ALL garbage into the Great Lakes or their connecting waters is prohibited.” (In the Great Lakes, it is illegal to dump anything except fresh fish, fish parts, dishwater, or graywater anywhere, regardless of distance from shore.)

Garbage Management Plan In addition to the placard requirement, the regulations require a written garbage management plan for U.S. craft over 40 feet (12.2 m) in length that operate in coastal waters beyond three nautical miles of the shore, engage in commerce, or have a galley and berthing quarters. The plan must describe the procedures of collecting, processing, storing, and properly disposing of garbage in a way that will not violate the regulations. It must also designate the person responsible for carrying out the plan.

Vessel owners who have specific questions regarding the form or content of a Garbage Management Plan should contact the nearest U.S. Coast Guard Captain of the Port: see Appendix C.

#### Disposal Ashore

Ports and terminals that conduct business with commercial vessels must be capable of receiving garbage from such vessels when they dock.

Recreational boating facilities (such as marinas and yacht clubs) capable of providing dockage or other services for 10 or more boats must provide adequate garbage reception facilities for any vessel that routinely calls. (Boats must be conducting business with the marina or other facility in order to qualify for the service; facilities would not be expected to provide such service to a vessel whose sole reason for docking was to offload its garbage.) Reasonable fees can be charged for providing services for the reception of garbage. Special requirements exist for facilities that receive garbage from craft returning from international waters.

#### Enforcement & Penalties

The U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for the enforcement of these antipollution regulations. Civil penalties can be as great as $25,000, and a person who knowingly violates the regulations commits a class D felony.

Notice of Violation In instances of small oil discharges (under 100 gallons) and minor violations of pollution regulations, after investigation and evaluation of an alleged violation has been completed, an issuing officer may issue a Notice of Violation. This will include information on the alleged violation and the applicable law or regulation; the amount of maximum penalty that may be assessed; and the amount of the proposed penalty that appears to be appropriate. The notice will also state how the penalty may be paid, and that payment will settle the case.

A Notice of Violation will advise the recipient of his right to decline the notice and request a hearing. Action must be taken within 45 days. Failure to either pay the proposed penalty or request a hearing will result in a finding of default, and the Coast Guard will proceed with collection action. If the proposed penalty is paid, a finding of “proved” will be entered on the record and the case closed.

Vessels denied the ability to offload their garbage at a marina or terminal should report this to the nearest Coast Guard Captain of the Port or Marine Safety Office. Observations of vessels violating the regulations can be reported to these same offices.

### Discharge of Oil

Federal regulations provide that all vessels 26 feet (7.9 m) or more in length must have a placard of at least 5 by 8 inches, made of durable material fixed in a conspicuous place in each machinery space, or at the bilge and ballast pump control station, stating the following in the language or languages understood by the crew:

Persons who see an oil or chemical spill can report it by calling toll-free: 800-424-8802.

##### DISCHARGE OF OIL PROHIBITED

The Federal Water Pollution Control Act prohibits the discharge of oil or oily waste into or upon the navigable waters of the United States, or the waters of the contiguous zone, or which may affect natural resources belonging to, appertaining to, or under the exclusive management authority of the United States, if such discharge causes a film or discoloration of the surface of the water or causes a sludge or emulsion beneath the surface of the water. Violators are subject to substantial civil penalties and/or criminal sanctions including fines and imprisonment.

# CHAPTER3

Figure 3-01 Standard safety equipment includes life jackets (Type I inherently buoyant and inflatable and Type III and Type IV flotation aids are shown). Other safety equipment pictured: an emergency signal kit, fire extinguisher, handheld VHF radio, horn, binocular, searchlight, flashlight, and a hand bearing compass.

EQUIPMENT FOR BOATS

Legally Required Gear That Your Boat Must Carry • Additional Items That Add to Your Safety • Optional Gear That Provides Comfort & Convenience

Although most manufacturers supply the basic equipment required by law, and often many other useful items, few new or used boats come with everything needed—or desired—for safe, enjoyable boating. You should select the additional gear that is best suited for your boating needs.

#### Categories of Equipment

Equipment for a boat can be divided into three categories for separate consideration. These groupings are:

Equipment Required by Federal, State, or Local Law This list is surprisingly limited. It has little flexibility; items are strictly specified and usually must be of an “approved” type.

Additional Equipment for Safety & Basic Operations This is gear not legally required, but includes items that could be considered necessary for normal boat use.

Equipment for Comfort & Convenience This is gear that is not necessary, but adds to the scope and enjoyment of your boating.

#### Factors Affecting Selection

In all three categories, the items and quantities will vary with the size of the craft and the use made of it, with the legally required items determined in most cases by the “class” of boat (see Chapter 2, this page), as set by the Motorboat Act of 1940 (MBA/40). Other factors, such as the amount of electrical power available on board, cost, etc., will also affect equipment selection.

## LEGALLY REQUIRED EQUIPMENT

The Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 (FBSA/71; see Chapter 2, this page) requires various items of equipment aboard boats. The specific details are spelled out in regulations stemming from MBA/40 and are published in a Coast Guard booklet, “A Boater’s Guide to the Federal Requirements for Recreational Boats.” Go to www.uscgboating.org and click on Regulations to learn more. This site provides a wealth of useful information under eight main subject headings.

Note that the FBSA/71 regulates the equipment of all boats including sailboats without mechanical propulsion, even though the regulations temporarily retained from the MBA/40 are in terms of “motorboats.” The 1940 act and its regulations remain effective for commercial vessels, such as diesel tugboats, which are not subject to the 1971 law.

### State Equipment Regulations

According to Title 46, Section 4306 of the U.S. Code, no state or political subdivision may establish a performance or other safety standard that is not identical to the federal standards for boating safety and equipment set forth in the FBSA/71. The intent is to provide uniform standards nationwide.

The FBSA/71 allows states and their political subdivisions, such as counties or cities, to have requirements for additional equipment beyond federal requirements if needed to meet “uniquely hazardous conditions or circumstances” in a state or local area. The federal government retains a veto over such additional state or local requirements.

### Required Equipment as a Minimum

Regard the legal requirements as a minimum. If a particular boat is required to have two fire extinguishers, for example, two may satisfy the authorities, but a third might be desirable, even necessary, to ensure that one is available at each location on board where it might be needed in a hurry. Two bilge vents may meet the regulations, but four would certainly give greater safety. Think “safety,” not just the minimum in order to be “legal.”

#### Nonapproved Items as Excess

Some boaters carry items of equipment no longer approved—older, superseded types, or items never approved—as “excess” equipment in addition to the legal minimum of approved items. This is not prohibited by regulations, but it may give a false sense of protection. The danger of reaching for one of these substandard items in an emergency must be recognized and positively guarded against. Some obsolete items of safety equipment, such as carbon tetrachloride fire extinguishers, are actually hazardous on a boat, and should never be on board.

### Personal Flotation Devices (PFDs)

Boating is not inherently unsafe, but there’s always a chance of someone falling overboard or the boat sinking—a small chance to be sure, but still a chance. A life jacket—commonly called a personal flotation device or PFD—is among the most essential safety items on any boat. Accident data show that 74 percent of boating deaths result from drowning, and 86 percent of drowning victims are not wearing a life jacket. In other words, most boating deaths are preventable. An average adult needs 10 to 12 pounds (4.5 to 5.4 kg) of supplemental buoyancy to remain afloat indefinitely. All PFDs approved by the U.S. Coast Guard and Transport Canada provide more than this minimum. PFDs also provide some protection against another cause of boating accident casualties—hypothermia.

All recreational boats subject to U.S. Coast Guard jurisdiction, regardless of means of propulsion—motor, sails, or otherwise—must carry a Coast Guard–approved PFD for each person on board. There are a few minor exceptions, such as sailboards, racing shells, rowing sculls, and racing kayaks. Under federal law, sailboards are not classified as “boats” and are therefore exempt, though state laws may require a sailboarder to wear a PFD. Foreign boats temporarily in U.S. waters are also exempted. “Persons on board” include those in tow, such as waterskiers. PFDs must be in serviceable condition.

Additionally, all children under the age of 13 years must wear an appropriate USCG-approved PFD on any boat unless belowdecks or in an enclosed cabin, or unless the craft is not underway. State boating regulations can be even more stringent—in many states eliminating even these two exemptions for children younger than 6 to 13 years old. Stricter state regulations supersede the Coast Guard requirements and will be enforced in that state’s waters by all authorities. It is critical that a child’s PFD be of the proper size and fit and that it be tried out in a safe place such as a swimming pool. The child must not be able to slip out of the device; crotch straps are an important feature for children’s flotation devices.

More stringent requirements are placed on vessels carrying passengers for hire (any number) than are applied to recreational boats.

Coast Guard approval of a PFD means that its design and manufacture meet or exceed required standards for buoyancy and construction. PFD types and labeling are undergoing a gradual shift from the legacy classification system described below to a new and hopefully clearer system, but as of mid-2020, only Type III PFDs are available with the new labeling system (see “Level 70 PFDs” on this page).

#### PFD Classification

For decades now, every Coast Guard–approved personal flotation device has been labeled with a “type” designation and descriptive name to indicate its intended performance level. Types I, II, III, and V PFDs are wearable, and Type IV PFDs are throwable. Most new PFDs are still labeled according to this legacy system; it is unclear when the shift to a new classification system will be completed, and even then, previously purchased PFDs may be used as long as they are in serviceable condition.

Type I PFD (Offshore Life Preserver or Life Jacket) is designed to turn an unconscious person from a face-downward position in the water to a face-up vertical or slightly backward position, and to maintain that position, increasing the chances of survival. A Type I PFD is the most effective of all types in rough water and is highly desirable for open and remote waters, especially where a probability of delayed rescue exists. A Type I PFD with inherent buoyancy is, however, somewhat less “wearable” than other types. Type I inflatable PFDs are more comfortable to wear but require more maintenance; see Figure 3-02.

Figure 3-02 A Type I personal flotation device is suitable for all waters and needed for rough seas. It is designed to turn most unconscious wearers to a face-up position. Inherently buoyant Type Is are available in a bib style as well as the jacket style shown here (left).

Type I PFDs are available in two sizes: adult—for someone weighing 90 pounds (40.8 kg) or more—and child (for someone weighing less than 90 pounds). The size is clearly labeled; a child size is not suitable for an infant. An adult size must provide at least 22 pounds (10 kg) of buoyancy; the child size must provide at least 11 pounds (5 kg).

Inherently buoyant Type I PFDs are available in jacket (also called vest) or bib (also called yolk or horse-collar) styles. The flotation material of the jacket style is encased in sealed plastic film covers and inserted in a jacket fitted with armholes and the necessary straps and ties. By covering the person’s sides and back as well as chest, the jacket style provides some protection against hypothermia.

The bib or yolk style is the familiar horseshoe shape that lacks armholes; it covers the chest and the back of the neck but not the back or underarms. It is not shown in Figure 3-02, but the Type II PFD at left in Figure 3-03 is a bib style. Bib-style Type I PFDs stack compactly for stowage and are commonly used on passenger ships. The flotation consists of shaped sections of unicellular plastic foam that are enclosed in fabric or dipped in a vinyl coating. Adjustable body straps provide a secure fit.

Type I inflatable PFDs approved for use on recreational craft must have at least two inflation chambers, either of which can independently meet the PFD’s in-water performance requirements. One chamber must have an automatic or automatic/manual CO2 inflator system, and the other must have at least a manual CO2 inflation system.

Type I PFDs are individually inspected after manufacture and are labeled with the type, the manufacturer’s name and address, the USCG approval number, and the date and place of inspection with the inspector’s initials. All Type I PFDs are required to be international orange for daylight visibility, and all have patches of reflecting material to aid in the location of a person in the water at night.

Type II PFD (Nearshore Buoyancy Aid) is designed to turn the wearer to a face-up vertical or slightly backward position in the water. The turning action is not as great as with a Type I, so a Type II will not turn as many persons face-up as a Type I under the same conditions; note the lack of the qualification “unconscious,” although some Type IIs have a flotation collar that assists in such turning. Tests have shown that a Type II does not provide adequate safety in rough water; it is intended for use in calm inland waters where there is a good chance of quick rescue. See Figure 3-03.

Figure 3-03 A Type II personal flotation device is also called a Near-Shore Buoyant Vest and should only be depended upon where there is a good chance of quick rescue. This will turn some unconscious wearers face up, but its turning action is less than a Type I; it is, however, somewhat more comfortable to wear. The bib style is shown at left.

Type II PFDs are available in four sizes: for an adult weighing more than 90 pounds (40.8 kg); for a youth weighing 50 to 90 pounds (22.6 to 40.8 kg); for a child weighing 30 to 50 pounds (13.6 to 22.6 kg); or for an infant (less than 30 pounds). In addition, some models are sized by chest measurement. A Type II PFD must have buoyancy of at least 15.5 pounds in the adult size, 11 pounds in the youth size, or 7 pounds (3.2 kg) in the child and infant sizes. Like their Type I counterparts, Type II PFDs are available in inherently buoyant or inflatable constructions, with the latter authorized for use only by persons at least 16 years of age.

Inherently buoyant Type II PFDs (again, like their Type I counterparts) are available as jackets (vests) or bibs (yolks). (To further confuse things, Type II PFDs are often referred to collectively as “life vests” to distinguish them from Type I PFDs, which are called “life preservers” or “life jackets.”) An inherently buoyant Type II uses the same flotation materials as a Type I PFD but is smaller and provides less buoyancy, and hence somewhat less safety, for a person in the water. The Type II is usually more comfortable to wear than a Type I, however, and a PFD that is not worn is less likely to help you in an emergency!

Type II PFDs are labeled with the model number, manufacturer’s name and address, approval number, and other information. Unlike Type I PFDs, they are approved by lot and are not individually inspected and marked.

Type III PFD (Flotation Aid) is designed so that an active wearer can assume a vertical or slightly backward position and be maintained in that position with no tendency to turn face down. This type can be the most comfortable to wear and is available in a variety of styles adapted to such activities as waterskiing, fishing, canoeing, and kayaking. It is a suitable choice for a wearer who is likely to enter the water intentionally. In-water trials have shown, however, that while a Type III jacket will provide adequate support in calm waters, it may not keep the wearer’s face clear in rough waters; this limitation should be kept in mind. See Figure 3-04.

Figure 3-04 A Type III personal flotation device is a “flotation aid”—it should be used only in calm protected waters or where there is assurance of a quick rescue. A wearer must place himself in a face-up position; there is no inherent turning action as in Types I and II. It is generally the most comfortable to wear. Available with a variety of styles and accessories for different watersports, Type IIIs are the most common PFDs.

A Type III PFD must provide the same buoyancy as a Type II—at least 15.5 pounds in the adult size—but is not required to turn an unconscious wearer face-up in in the water. Type IIIs are for inland waters when quick rescue is likely. Some models include pockets for such items to aid rescue as a flashlight, flares, floating distress flag, and signaling mirror.

Type IV PFD (Throwable device) is designed to be grasped rather than worn and is typically thrown to a person who has fallen overboard. It is designed for use in calm inland waters with heavy traffic, where help is always present. Type IVs are available in a variety of forms; see Figure 3-05 for some of these.

Figure 3-05 A Type IV personal flotation device is a throwable PFD; it can take many shapes and forms. Shown above are a life ring buoy, a horseshoe buoy, and a cushion. Type IV PFDs are intended to be grasped rather than worn, and hence are of no value to an unconscious person.

Buoyant cushions are the most widely used Type IV. They are made of thick foam material in plastic cases measuring approximately 15 inches square by 2 inches thick. There are two grab straps on opposite sides for holding the PFD to your chest. Although they provide good buoyancy—more, actually, than an inherently buoyant vest—they do not provide safety for an exhausted or unconscious person. They are approved (by lot and number) in various shapes, sizes, and colors. Never wear a cushion on your back. See also Figure 3-07.

Ring buoys (more properly called life ring buoys) may be of cork, balsa wood, or unicellular plastic foam construction. The ring is surrounded by a light grab line fastened at four points for handholds. Standard sizes are 20 inches (51 cm), 24 inches (61 cm), and 30 inches (76 cm) outside diameter. Life rings of 18.5 inches (47 cm) diameter have been approved under the “special purpose water safety buoyant device” category and are authorized for use on boats of any size that are not carrying passengers for hire.

Rings of plastic foam with special surface treatment will carry a small metal plate with approval information including the inspector’s initials. Ring buoys of this style may be either international orange or white in color. Some skippers letter the name of the boat on their ring buoys; this is not prohibited by the regulations.

Horseshoe buoys are often found on cruising sailboats and almost always on larger racing sailboats for man-overboard emergencies. These are made of unicellular foam encased in a vinyl-coated nylon cover. The shape is aptly described by the device’s name—it is much easier to get into in the water than a ring buoy. These are normally carried vertically in special holders near the stern of the boat; some holders are designed to release the horseshoe buoy quickly by merely pulling a pin on a cord. To facilitate the recovery of the victim, these rings are often equipped with special accessories at the end of a short length of line—a small float with a slender pole topped with a flag (and, in some cases, with a radar reflector), an electric flashing light that automatically comes on when floating upright in the water, a small drogue to slow the rate of drift to more nearly approximate that of a man in the water, or a combination of these items.

A Type IV PFD cushion must have at least 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of buoyancy; ring buoys must have 16.5 pounds (7.5 kg) to 32 pounds (14.5 kg) of buoyancy, depending on diameter.

Type V PFD (Special Use Device) is any buoyancy aid designed for a specific, restricted use. It may be carried instead of another type only if used according to the approval condition stated on the device’s label, which often requires that it be worn if used to satisfy the PFD regulation. A Type V PFD may provide the performance of a Type I, II, or III device as marked on the label.

Varieties include exposure suits (which provide significant hypothermia protection), work vests (which may be worn by crewmembers and workmen when employed over or near water under favorable conditions and supervision), and sailboard vests. Offshore sailors and power-boaters can wear Type V inflatable vests that provide Type I or II performance and, for sailors, integral harnesses for hooking onto a lifeline.

##### LEVEL 70 PFDS

The U.S. Coast Guard and Transport Canada have been working since 2008 to develop harmonized PFD standards so that boaters who cross the international border need not carry two sets. The new standards will replace language-based labels with icon-based labels that are designed to be easier to understand in English, French, and Spanish. Each label bears a numerical performance level—50, 70, 100, or 150—based on tests of the device’s buoyancy, turning action, and sea state range. A 50-level PFD is for a conscious wearer in gentle seas with immediate help at hand. A 150-level PFD will turn an unconscious wearer face-up in rough offshore waters and keep him afloat until help arrives—i.e., the equivalent of a Type I PFD under the U.S. legacy system.

As of 2020, only Type III PFDs are affected. The legacy labels on these PFDs are gradually being replaced by icon-based labels denoting “Level 70” performance. On these labels, an icon under the number 70 indicates that it is intended for calm nearshore seas where help (denoted by a hand) is nearby. The icon of a slash through a turning arrow means that this PFD is not designed to turn or keep an unconscious wearer face-up. A third group of up to five icons indicates what the PFD is not intended to be used for. In the example shown here, the PFD is not intended for a personal watercraft, waterskiing, a towed watersport, or whitewater paddling.

#### More on PFD Varieties

Inflatable PFDs are much less bulky and more comfortable and are therefore more likely to be worn; see Figure 3-06. Most are vest types, but there are also approved belt-pouches. As mentioned in the foregoing discussion, there are Type I, II, and III inflatables, and there are Type V inflatables that may be classed as providing Type I, II, or III performance, depending on their buoyancy.

Figure 3-06 Inflatable PFDs can be either manual or manual/automatic inflation and can provide Type I, II, or III performance. Though expensive, these are the most comfortable for routine wearing but must be worn to count toward the legal requirement, if the label so states. Inflatables are authorized for use only by persons at least 16 years of age.

Inflatable PFDs are available in either manual or automatic styles, depending on the inflation action. Manual models require the wearer to activate the small compressed-gas (CO2) cylinder. Automatic models inflate when a sensing device becomes wet; they can also be activated manually. Both models can be inflated by blowing into tubes.

Inflatable PFDs are not for everyone. They should be used only by persons who can swim, and they are not authorized for persons under 16 years of age. They are considerably more expensive than traditional PFDs, and they require maintenance. (The Coast Guard withheld approval for many years because of concern that boaters would not provide adequate maintenance.) After use, an inflatable PFD must be rearmed immediately with a new cartridge; if it is of the automatic style, the activating unit must be replaced. Some automatic models carry a spare cartridge in a pocket so they can be rearmed as a manual model in case of accidental activation.

Caution: Automatic inflatable PFDs should not be worn in cabins or other enclosed compartments. An unexpected capsize or flooding could actuate them and make exiting difficult or even impossible.

Special Purpose Water Safety Buoyant Devices are a category of PFDs that may be either Type II or Type III if designed to be worn, or Type IV if designed to be thrown. Their design is examined and approved by recognized laboratories (such as Underwriters Laboratories; see Chapter 11, this page); this approval is accepted by the Coast Guard. These devices are labeled with information about their intended use, the size or weight of the user, instructions for use and maintenance, and an approval number. Devices to be grasped rather than worn will be marked “Warning: Do Not Wear on Back.”

Hybrid PFDs combine inherent foam buoyancy with the capability of being inflated to a greater buoyancy. They are available in adult, youth, and child sizes. The inherent buoyancy ranges from 10 pounds (4.6 kg) to 7.5 pounds (3.4 kg) depending upon size, with inflated buoyancies of 22 pounds (10 kg) to 12 pounds (5.4 kg). A hybrid PFD is less bulky and more comfortable to wear than a traditional PFD, yet it provides at least some initial support in case of an accidental fall overboard with the victim possibly unconscious—and much greater buoyancy if the person is conscious and capable of inflating it.

Hybrid PFDs satisfy legal requirements only if they are being worn, if the label so states. These devices should be assigned to a specific person and fitted to that individual; they should be tried on in the water. Hybrid PFDs are not desirable for use by guests; guests should have Types I, II, or III.

Figure 3-07 By far the most common Type IV personal flotation device is the buoyant cushion. This is primarily a lifesaving device, not just another cushion on board. The straps should be grasped, but a person’s arms may be placed through the straps to hold the device in front of him, never on the back.

##### MAINTENANCE FOR YOUR PFDS

It is not only a requirement of Coast Guard regulations to maintain your life jackets in good condition; it is common sense—your life may depend on them some day! So take care of them, and remember that a PFD, like any other item of equipment on your boat, eventually wears out and must be replaced.

• You and each person in your regular crew should have a specifically assigned PFD marked with their name. It should be tried regularly in shallow water. It should hold its wearer comfortably so that he or she can breathe easily.

• After each use, each PFD should be air-dried thoroughly away from any direct heat source. Then store it in a dry, well-ventilated, easily accessible place on board the boat.

• Check at least once a year for mildew, loose straps, or broken zippers (if applicable). Clean with mild soap and running water; avoid using strong detergents or chemical cleaners, and do not dry clean. Check PFD covers for tears—a cover that has torn due to weakened fabric is unserviceable; a weak cover could split open and allow the flotation material to be lost. Badly faded colors that should be bright can be a clue that deterioration has occurred. Compare fabric color where it is protected—under a strap, for example—to where it is exposed. A PFD with a UV-damaged fabric cover should be replaced without delay. Another test is to pinch the fabric between thumb and forefinger and try to tear it. If the cover can be torn, the life jacket should be replaced.

• Check PFDs that use kapok-filled bags for buoyancy. Make sure that the kapok has not hardened and that there are no holes in the bags. Squeeze the bags and listen for an air leak. If water has entered a bag, the kapok will eventually rot. Destroy and replace any PFD that fails these tests.

• Avoid contact with oil or grease, which sometimes causes kapok materials to deteriorate and lose buoyancy

• Avoid kneeling on PFDs; do not use them for fenders.

#### PFD Requirements by Boat Size

All recreational boats must have on board at least one approved wearable personal flotation device of Type I, II, III, or V for each person on board. Though they need not be worn, except with some Type Vs, they must be near at hand. A Type V must provide the performance of a Type I, II, or III (as marked on its label) and must be used in accordance with that label.

Boats 16 feet or more in length must additionally have on board at least one Type IV “throwable” PFD.

All PFDs must be Coast Guard approved, in good condition, of appropriate size for the intended users, and legibly marked with their approval numbers.

#### Stowage of PFDs

The best “storage” of your PFD is on your person while your boat is underway—the need for it may arise suddenly with no time to find it and put it on. A wearable PFD may save your life, but only if you wear it.

When not being worn, it is best that PFDs be stored out of direct sunlight. Coast Guard regulations are very specific about stowage of personal flotation devices. Any required Type I, II, or III (or acceptable Type V) PFD must be “readily accessible.” Any Type IV PFD required to be on board must be “immediately available.” These rules are strictly enforced.

The PFDs must also be in “serviceable condition.” Inspect your PFDs at least annually, and replace any that show signs of deterioration, usually found in the covering or straps.

### Fire Extinguishers

All hand-portable and semi-portable fire extinguishers and fixed fire extinguishing systems must be of a type that has been approved by the Coast Guard. Such extinguishers and extinguishing systems will be clearly labeled with information as to the manufacturer, type, and capacity. (See below for information on type and size.)

Coast Guard approval of hand-portable extinguishers requires that they be in approved marine-type mounting brackets.

#### Types of Fire Extinguishers

Fire extinguishers, including those for boats, are described in terms of their contents—the extinguishing agent.

Dry Chemical This type of extinguisher is widely used because of its convenience and relatively low cost. The cylinder contains a dry chemical in powdered form together with a propellant gas under pressure. Coast Guard regulations require that such extinguishers be equipped with a gauge or indicator to show that normal gas pressure exists within the extinguisher; do not carry one that does not meet this requirement, it is not USCG approved; see Figure 3-08.

Figure 3-08 Most fire extinguishers on boats will be portable dry-chemical units. These must have a pressure gauge, which should be checked regularly. Extinguishers must be USCG approved and mounted on an approved bracket.

The dry chemical in these extinguishers has a tendency to “pack” or “cake.” Mount them where there is a minimum of engine vibrations; invert and shake them every month or two.

Carbon Dioxide Some boats have carbon dioxide (CO2) extinguishing systems; such units are advantageous as they leave no messy residue to clean up after use, and they cannot cause harm to the interior of engines as some other types may. This type of extinguishing agent may be used as a fixed system installed in an engine compartment, operated either manually or automatically by heat-sensitive detectors. Semi-portable extinguishers (wheeled carts) will be seen on some marina piers and in boatyards.

Carbon dioxide extinguishers consist of a cylinder containing this gas under high pressure, a valve, and a discharge nozzle, sometimes at the end of a short hose. The state of charge of a CO2 extinguisher can only be checked by weighing the cylinder and comparing this figure with the one stamped on or near the valve. See Chapter 11, this page, for further details on the maintenance of CO2 extinguishers.

Vapor Systems Other chemical vapors with a fire extinguishing action are available. Halon 1301 is a colorless, odorless gas that stops fire instantly by chemical action. It is heavier than air and sinks to lower parts of the bilge. Unfortunately, Halon has been found to be an ozone-depleting agent, and the federal Clean Air Act of 1994 prohibited it from being manufactured. In addition, in 1998 the EPA required that Halon equipment must be properly discharged at the end its useful life by sending it to a Halon recovery facility meeting EPA standards. It is not illegal, however, to possess, use, or even replace Halon manufactured before 1994. Many new fire-fighting agents that replace Halon are clean, meaning they do not deplete ozone in the environment and they do not leave a residue or require a cleanup after they extinguish a fire.

An alternative chemical for vapor systems is FE-241; however, this gas is toxic and must not be used in occupied spaces. It is used in engine compartments, with the size of extinguisher matched to the volume of the space to be protected. To avoid damage to engines, especially diesels, it should be used with an automatic shutdown device. FM-200 is another chemical for fire extinguishers that is considered safe for use in occupied spaces, but is significantly more expensive.

The state of charge of a vaporizing liquid extinguisher can only be checked by weighing the cylinder and comparing this figure with the one stamped on or near the valve; see Chapter 11, this page for further details on the maintenance of Halon and FE-241 extinguishers.

Foam Aqueous film foam forming (AFFF) extinguishers are legally acceptable on boats, but this type is rarely used, as it leaves a residue that is difficult to clean up after use and may require a partial engine disassembly if discharged in an engine compartment.

Foam extinguishers are not pressurized before use and do not require tests for leakage. Such units contain water and must be protected from freezing. Foam extinguishers should be discharged and recharged annually.

Nonacceptable Types Vaporizing-liquid extinguishers, such as those containing carbon tetrachloride and chlorobromomethane, are effective in fighting fires but produce highly toxic gases. They are not approved for use on motorboats and should not be carried even as excess equipment because of their danger to the health—or even life—of a user in a confined space.

#### Classification of Extinguishers

Fires are classified—according to the general type of material being burned—into four categories, three of which are of concern to boaters: A (combustible materials), B (flammable liquids), C (electrical components); see Chapter 12, this page. The fourth category—D (flammable metals, such as magnesium)—does not concern boaters.

Fire extinguishers are similarly classified as to type and, commonly, are placed in size groups, I (the smallest) through V (largest). Only the two smallest sizes, I and II, are hand portable; size III is a semi-portable fire extinguishing system, and IV and V are too large for consideration here.

In 2016, the Coast Guard issued new regulations that will eventually replace the CG codes on the labels with the more familiar Underwriter Laboratories (UL) ratings, which already appear on many extinguishers. The UL rating provides a better guide to extinguisher capacity. The Coast Guard’s B-I rating (see Figure 3-09) will be replaced by “5-B,” which is equivalent to a UL 5-B:C rating. The B-II rating will be replaced by “20-B,” which is equivalent to a UL 20-B:C rating.

Figure 3-09 Fire extinguishers that are approved by the Coast Guard under pre-2016 regulations for use on boats are hand-portable, B-I or B-II classification, and have the characteristics shown above.

The primary fire hazard on boats results from flammable liquids, so Type B extinguishers are specified. (Some B extinguishers have adequate or limited effectiveness on other classes of fire; ABC extinguishers are effective on all three classes. Other extinguishers should not be used on certain types of fires, such as foam on Class C electrical fires.)

The new regulations affect vessels built after August 22, 2016, but do not require existing fire extinguishers to be replaced as long as they are serviceable and properly maintained. In addition, it will take some time before the new standard appears on fire extinguisher labels, and in the meantime stores will continue to sell fire extinguishers that are marked with the Coast Guard size codes I and II. When replacing an existing Class I fire extinguisher, if the new one has Coast Guard Class I on the label, make sure it also has a UL 5-B:C rating or higher. Similarly, when replacing an existing Class II fire extinguisher, if the new one has Coast Guard Class II on the label, make sure it also has a UL 20-B:C rating or higher.

#### Requirements on Boats

Fire extinguishers on boats must be specifically marked “Marine Type U.S. Coast Guard Approved.”

Class A (under 16 feet) and Class 1 (16 to under 26 feet or 7.9 m) boats must have at least one type 5-B (UL 5-B:C or higher) hand-portable fire extinguisher, except that boats of these classes with outboard motors and portable fuel tanks, not carrying passengers for hire and of such open construction that there can be no entrapment of explosive or flammable gases or vapors, need not carry an extinguisher. See Figure 3-10.

Figure 3-10 Fire extinguisher requirements.

A fire extinguisher is required on boats under 26 feet (7.9 m) in length powered with outboard motors if one or more of the following conditions exist; see Figure 3-11:

• Closed compartment under thwarts or seats in which portable fuel tanks may be stored.

• Double bottoms not sealed to the hull or which are not completely filled with flotation material.

• Closed living spaces.

• Closed storage compartments in which combustible or flammable materials are stowed.

• Permanently installed fuel tanks. (To avoid being considered as “permanently installed,” tanks must not be physically attached in such a manner that they cannot be moved in case of fire or other emergency. The size of the tank in gallons is not a specific criterion for determining whether it is a portable or a permanently installed tank. If the weight of a fuel tank is such that persons on board cannot move it, the Coast Guard considers it to be permanently installed.)

Figure 3-11 If a craft has one or more of the enclosed spaces identified above, Coast Guard regulations require that it must carry at least one fire extinguisher.

The following conditions do not, of themselves, require that fire extinguishers be carried; see Figure 3-12:

• Bait wells

• Glove compartments

• Buoyant flotation material

• Open-slatted flooring

• Ice chests

Figure 3-12 A boat of open construction, with no enclosed spaces other than those shown here, need not have a fire extinguisher on board, but one is desirable for safety.

Class 2 boats (26 feet to under 40 feet long) must carry at least two 5-B approved hand-portable fire extinguishers, or at least one 20-B unit.

Class 3 boats (40 to 65 feet long) must carry at least three 5-B approved hand extinguishers, or at least one 20-B unit plus one 5-B unit.

Boats with fixed extinguisher systems in the engine compartment may have the above minimum requirement for their size reduced by one 5-B unit. The fixed system must meet Coast Guard specifications.

Exemptions Motorboats propelled by outboard motors, while engaged in a previously arranged and announced race (and such boats designed solely for racing, while engaged in operations incidental to preparing for racing) are exempted by Coast Guard regulations from any requirements to carry fire extinguishers.

#### Keeping Safe

Don’t merely purchase and mount fire extinguishers and then forget all about them. All types require some maintenance and checking; see this page and this page for guidance in keeping up the level of fire protection you gain when first installing new extinguishers.

All members of your regular crew, and any guests who may be aboard, should know the locations and operation of all fire extinguishers.

Never partially discharge a dry-chemical extinguisher with the idea of saving the balance of its contents for later use. There is almost always some powder left in the valve, and this will result in a slow leak of pressure, rendering the unit useless. Always recharge or replace fire extinguishers immediately after use. As the cost of recharging small extinguishers is almost the cost of a new one, replacement is the usual action.

### Backfire Flame Control

Every inboard gasoline engine must be equipped with an acceptable means of backfire flame control. Such a device is commonly called a “flame arrester” and must meet Coast Guard specifications to be approved. Accepted models will be listed by manufacturer’s number in equipment lists or will have an approval number marked on the grid housing.

In use, flame arresters must be secured to the air intake of the carburetor with a flame-tight connection, have clean elements, and have no separation of the grids that would permit flames to pass through; see Figure 3-13. Fuel-injected engines without carburetors require a backfire flame arrester over the air intake to prevent exhaust valves from backfiring into the air chamber, which might cause a fire or explosion.

Figure 3-13 A backfire flame control is more widely known as a “flame arrester.” Coast Guard regulations require an approved model on every inboard gasoline engine. Elements must be kept clean, and grids must not have any separations that would let flames pass through.

An exception is made for boats constructed so that the fuel/air induction system is above the sides of the hull—typically craft used in connection with waterskiing—provided that specified conditions are met.

### Ventilation Requirements

All motorboats, except open boats, that use fuel having a flashpoint of 110°F (43.3°C) or less—gasoline, but not diesel—must have ventilation for every engine and fuel tank compartment. Gasoline in its liquid and vapor states is potentially dangerous, but to enjoy safe boating, one need only follow Coast Guard regulations and use good common sense.

The Coast Guard requires mechanical ventilation blowers on all boats built after 31 July 1980 under regulations derived from the Motorboat Act of 1940; see Figure 3-14. Manufacturers must provide such equipment, and no person may operate such a boat that has a gasoline engine for propulsion, electrical generation, or mechanical power unless it has an operable ventilation system that meets the requirements. Thus the initial requirement is placed on the builder, but the owner has a continuing responsibility. Boats of “open construction” are exempted.

Figure 3-14 A powered ventilation system consists of one or more intake ducts plus one or more exhaust ducts with an exhaust blower. Each exhaust blower must draw from the lower one-third of the engine compartment but above the normal level of bilge water.

#### Open Construction Defined

The Coast Guard has prepared a set of specifications to guide the boat owner in determining whether his boat meets the definition of “open construction.” To qualify for exemption from the bilge ventilation regulations, the boat must meet all of the following conditions:

• As a minimum, the engine and fuel tank compartments must have 15 square inches of open area directly exposed to the atmosphere for each cubic foot of net compartment volume. (Net volume is found by determining total volume and then subtracting the volume occupied by the engine, tanks, and other accessories, etc.)

• There must be no long or narrow unventilated spaces accessible from the engine or fuel tank compartments into which fire could spread.

• Long, narrow compartments, such as side panels, if joining engine or fuel tank compartments and not serving as ducts, must have at least 15 square inches of open area per cubic foot through frequent openings along the compartment’s full length.

Sailboats are subject to the same ventilation requirements as powerboats if combustible fuel is carried on board.

#### Be Safe—Be Sure

If your boat is home-built or does not meet one or more of the specifications above, or if there is any doubt, play it safe and provide an adequate ventilation system. To err on the safe side will not be costly; it may save a great deal, perhaps even a life.

#### Natural Ventilation

Unless it is of open construction, a gasoline-engine-powered boat is required to have at least two ventilation ducts, fitted with cowls at their openings to the atmosphere, for each engine and fuel tank compartment. An exception is made for fuel tank compartments having electrical components that are “ignition protected” in accordance with Coast Guard standards and fuel tanks that are vented to the outside of the boat; see Figure 3-15.

Figure 3-15 A natural ventilation system is an arrangement of intake openings or ducts from the atmosphere (located on the outside of the hull), or from a ventilated compartment, or from a compartment that is open to the atmosphere. There are also one or more exhaust ducts.

Ventilators, ducts, and cowls must be installed so that they provide for efficient removal of explosive or flammable gases from bilges of each engine and fuel tank compartment. To create a flow through the ducting system—at least when underway or when there is a wind—cowls (scoops) or other fittings of equal effectiveness are needed on all ducts. A wind-actuated rotary exhaust fan or mechanical blower is equivalent to a cowl or an exhaust duct.

Lack of adequate bilge ventilation can result in an order from a Coast Guard Boarding Officer for “termination of unsafe use” of the boat; see Chapter 2, this page.

#### Ducts Required

Ducts are a necessary part of a ventilation system. A mere hole in the hull won’t do; that’s a vent, not a ventilator. “Vents,” the Coast Guard explains, “are openings that permit venting, or escape of gases due to pressure differential. Ventilators are openings that are fitted with cowls to direct the flow of air and vapors in or out of ducts that channel movement of air for the actual displacement of fumes from the space being ventilated.” Each supply and exhaust duct must extend to the lower third of the compartment and must be above the normal accumulation of bilge water.

#### Size of Ducts

Ventilation must be adequate for the size and design of the boat. There should be no constriction in the ducting system that is smaller than the minimum cross-sectional area required for efficiency. Where a stated size of duct is not available, the next larger size should be used.

Small Motorboats To determine the minimum cross-sectional area of the cowls and ducts of motorboats having small engine and/or fuel tank compartments, see Table 3-1, which is based on net compartment volume (as previously defined).

Table 3-1 Ventilation requirements for small boats.

Cruisers and Large Boats For most cruisers and other large motorboats, see Table 3-2, which is based on the craft’s beam; this is a practical guide for determination of the minimum size of ducts and cowls.

Table 3-2 Ventilation requirements for large powerboats.

#### Ducting Materials

For safety and long life, ducts should be made of nonferrous, galvanized ferrous, or sturdy high-temperature resistant nonmetallic materials. Ducts should be routed clear of, and protected from, contact with hot engine surfaces.

#### Positioning of Cowls

Intake cowls will normally face forward in an area of free airflow underway, and the exhaust cowl will face aft so that a suction effect can be expected.

The two cowls, or sets of cowls, should be located with respect to each other, horizontally and/or vertically, so as to prevent return of fumes removed from any space back into the same or any other space. Intake cowls should be positioned to avoid picking up vapors from fueling operations.

#### Combustion Air for Engines

Openings into the engine compartments for entry of air for the engine’s combustion air are in addition to requirements of the ventilation system.

#### Requirements for Boats

On boats built after 31 July 1980, each compartment having a permanently installed gasoline engine with a cranking motor for remote starting must be ventilated by a powered exhaust blower system unless it is of “open construction” as defined on this page. Each exhaust blower, or combination of blowers, must be rated at an airflow capacity not less than a value computed by formulas based on the net volume of the engine compartment plus other compartments open thereto.

The engine compartment—and other compartments open to it where the aggregate area of openings exceeds two percent of the area between the compartments—must also have a natural ventilation system.

There must be a warning label in plain view close to the ignition switch that advises of the danger of gasoline vapors and the need to run the exhaust blower for at least four minutes and then check the engine compartment for fuel vapors before starting the engine.

Natural ventilation systems are also required for any compartment containing both a permanently installed fuel tank and any electrical component that is not “ignition protected” in accordance with existing Coast Guard electrical standards for boats; or a compartment that contains a fuel tank that vents into that compartment (highly unlikely); or one having a nonmetallic fuel tank that exceeds a specified permeability rate. The USCG regulations specify the required cross-sectional area of ducts for natural ventilation based on compartment net volume, and how ducts shall be installed.

The regulations above concern the manufacturer of the boat, but there is also a requirement placed on the operator that these ventilation systems be operable any time the boat is in use. Because such systems are so desirable, it is recommended that they be installed on any gasoline-powered motorboat or auxiliary; see also fuel vapor detectors in Chapter 11, this page.

#### Requirements for Older Boats

On boats built before 1 August 1980, only natural ventilation is required—one intake cowl and duct extending from the atmosphere to a point at least midway to the bilge or below the carburetor; there must also be at least one exhaust cowl and duct extending from the atmosphere to the lower portion of the bilge (but not so low as to become blocked by normal bilge water levels). For such boats, there is no federal requirement as to the minimum duct size, but Coast Guard policy is that the smallest acceptable size is two inches for all boats.

If the boat is equipped with a bilge blower, its duct could serve as the exhaust duct for natural ventilation as well, provided the size of the duct is large enough and the flow of air is not obstructed by the fan blades. A separate duct is also acceptable.

#### Diesel-Powered Boats

Diesel fuel does not come within the Coast Guard’s definition of a “volatile” fuel, and thus bilge ventilation legal requirements are not applicable. It is, however, a sensible step to provide essentially the same ventilation system for your boat even if it is diesel-powered, particularly because diesel engines require a high volume of air for efficient combustion. Diesel fuel does not explode, but it does burn; a broken fuel line can cause a fire that could result in the total loss of your boat.

### Visual Distress Signals

All boats of any type 16 feet (4.9 m) or more in length, and all craft of any size carrying six or fewer passengers for hire, must be equipped with approved visual distress signals (VDS) at all times when operating on coastal waters. Boats engaged in regattas or racing, manually propelled boats, and sailboats less than 26 feet (7.9 m) in length, of completely open construction, and not equipped with propulsion machinery are not required to carry day signals, but must carry night signals when operating from sunset to sunrise.

There are two types of VDS: nonpyrotechnic, such as a special orange flag or an approved signaling light; and pyrotechnic, such as a red flare or smoke signal. If pyrotechnics are selected, there must be three such signals available to satisfy the requirement. If nonpyrotechnics are chosen, one day and one night signal will suffice. Thus the VDS requirement may be met by carrying three day and three night pyrotechnic signals or by carrying a special daytime flag and a special nighttime flashing light. Boats less than 16 feet (4.9 m) in length—with the exceptions noted above—must carry distress signals when operating at night. Day signals are not required on such boats but would be prudent to carry.

U.S. coastal waters are defined as the Great Lakes and the territorial seas (out to 12 miles from shore) plus any connected waters having an entrance that is wider than two nautical miles, extending inland to the first point at which the distance between shorelines narrows to less than two miles (see Chapter 2, this page, for more on these definitions). Shorelines of islands or points of land within a waterway are considered in determining the distance between opposite shorelines.

#### Types of Visual Distress Signals

Visual distress signals are classified for day (D) or night (N) use, or for both (D/N). To meet the requirements, a boat must have an orange flag with special square-and-disc markings in black (D) and an S-O-S electric light (N); or three handheld or floating orange smoke signals (D), plus three flares (N); or three red flares of hand-held, meteor, or parachute type (D/N). Each signal must be legibly marked with a Coast Guard approval number or certification statement. It must be serviceable and not past any expiration date; see Figure 3-16. (Pyrotechnic signals will have an expiration date 42 months after manufacture.) Combinations of various flare types and smoke signals are acceptable. (The flares must carry an approval; older launchers may be used if still available.) In some states, a pistol launcher for flares may be considered a firearm and subject to licensing and other restrictions; check your local authorities before purchasing such a device. A unique “flag” is available that can be inflated to hold its full shape for constant maximum visibility; it can be used flat in the water to be seen from overhead.

Figure 3-16 Approved visual distress signals include hand-held flares, meteor and parachute flares, smoke signals, and others suitable for day or night use, or both.

All visual distress signals must be stowed so as to be “readily available.”

The legal requirements are a minimum; prudent skippers will carry additional and more robust signals to meet their particular needs. (See also this page.)

Visual distress signals must not be displayed on the water except where assistance is needed because of immediate or potential danger to the persons on board. This allows tests and demonstrations to be made on the shore, but good judgment should be used to avoid false alarms. If there is any likelihood of reports being made to the local Coast Guard unit, notify them by telephone or radio of your intended actions.

The use of pyrotechnic signals is not without hazard from the flame and hot dripping ash and slag. Hand-held flares must be held over the side and in such a way that hot slag will not drip on your hand or the deck or side of your boat. Pistol-launch flares should be fired downwind and at an angle of roughly 60° above the horizon, higher in stronger winds but never directly upward. In a distress situation, do not waste signals by setting them off when no other vessel is within sight.

If you are using a pistol-type launcher, check to make sure that the flares you have now or purchase later will fit—there have been small changes in the length of some flares, and not all will fit in all launchers.

### Marine Sanitation Devices

The regulatory requirements for a marine sanitation device (MSD) were discussed in Chapter 2, see this page. This section will cover the various types of MSDs that must be installed to meet those requirements, and the level of treatment they provide.

Figure 3-17 Type I Marine Sanitation Devices are available that more than meet the EPA and Coast Guard requirements for overboard discharge of human wastes. This device macerates and disinfects sewage in a two-step process. The effluent contains no floating solids and is typically cleaner than the water in which the boat is floating.

#### Type I & Type II MSDs

Type I and Type II marine sanitation devices are described in Coast Guard regulations as “flow-through” devices; the difference between the types is the level of treatment; see Figure 3-17.

The most common form is a macerator-chlorinator, which takes the discharge of a marine toilet, grinds up the solids to fine particles, treats the resultant waste with a disinfectant, and pumps the treated sewage overboard. Many MSDs dispense disinfectant from prefilled reservoirs. Others make their own disinfectant by using electricity to break down seawater, using the dissolved salt (NaCl, sodium chloride) to produce chlorine, the active disinfectant. In fresh or brackish waters, ordinary table salt may be placed in a dispenser to provide the necessary chemical.

A Type I MSD must be certified as being capable of discharging an overboard waste liquid that has a coliform bacterial count of not more than 1,000 per 100 milliliters of effluent. Most devices commonly installed on boats have a bacterial count much less than required, normally producing effluent with less than 10 coliform bacterial per 100 milliliter. This type of MSD must also not discharge any “visible floating solids.”

A Type II MSD must be certified to a level of a bacterial coliform count of not more than 200 per 100 milliliters, and total suspended solids of not more than 150 milligrams per liter. Few boats under 65 feet in length are equipped with this type.

A reminder: sewage, whether treated or not, cannot be discharged overboard in any designated “No Discharge Zone.”

#### Type III MSDs

Type III marine sanitation devices are described in the regulations as “non-flow-through” devices; there are two subcategories of this type.

Type III-A MSDs are designed to treat the sewage and hold it for later disposal. Typically, this is a recirculating toilet that is “charged” with a few gallons of water and special chemicals. An example of a fixed model of this is the toilet used on passenger aircraft; boats usually use a portable model, such as a Porta-Potti, with this device being limited to smaller craft. The treated water, plus the waste, is recirculated each time the toilet is used. The toilet can normally be used for several days before pump-out is necessary. This type also includes reduced-flush devices that ultimately evaporate and incinerate the waste to a sterile sludge or ash.

Type III-B MSDs are collection, holding, and transfer systems consisting of drain piping, holding tanks, pumps, valves, connectors, and other equipment used to collect and hold shipboard sewage waste for subsequent transfer to a shore sewage system, sewage barge, or for discharge overboard in unrestricted waters. Holding tanks are the common form of MSD found on boats that are not fitted with a Type I device. Tanks may be rigid in various shapes or flexible; they should be sized to fit the size and use of the boat. An indicator and/or warning system can be used with a holding tank to alert the skipper to an impending need for pump-out. Chemicals can be added to reduce any offensive odors, but these do not qualify as disinfecting the waste. Obviously, holding tanks cannot be pumped overboard in any “No Discharge Zone.”

#### Combination Systems

An excellent solution to the boat sewage disposal problem is a combination of a Type I MSD followed by a holding tank, as in the Raritan Electro Scan system. This allows you to treat the waste before it goes to the holding tank, reducing the possibility of unpleasant odors, and still allowing you to pump overboard where such action is legal.

### Other Required Equipment

Additional items of equipment required by law or Coast Guard regulations to be on board some or all boats include a whistle, a bell, navigation lights, and, in some instances, one or more day shapes. As with other equipment, these devices are graduated with the size of the vessel, and may vary with the waters on which they are used.

These requirements are covered in the Inland and International Navigation Rules; see Chapters 4 and 5.

Table 3-3 In addition to the federal equipment carriage requirements for recreational craft summarized above, the owner/operator may be required to comply with additional regulations specific to the state or area in which the boat is operated.

### State & Local Requirements

Boaters may expect to have to comply with additional requirements in many states, and possibly additional ones in some local jurisdictions. These are too diverse to be covered in this book, but each skipper should be aware of the possible need for additional legally required equipment in both home waters and other cruising areas.

### Equipment for Commercial Craft

Boats (including sailing and nonself-propelled vessels) used for carrying six or fewer passengers for hire (paying passengers), or for commercial fishing, are “commercial uninspected vessels” subject to the Motorboat Act of 1940 and Coast Guard regulations issued under the authority of that act.

All nonrecreational craft less than 40 feet (12.2 m) in length and not carrying passengers for hire, such as commercial fishing boats, must have on board at least one life preserver, buoyant vest, or special-purpose water safety buoyant device of a suitable size for each person on board. “Suitable size” means that sufficient children’s lifesaving devices (medium or small, as appropriate) must be carried in addition to adult sizes.

All vessels carrying passengers for hire (six or fewer) and all other vessels subject to the MBA/40 and over 40 feet (12.2 m) in length must have at least one life preserver of a suitable size for each person on board.

Each vessel 26 feet (7.9 m) or more in length must also carry at least one life ring buoy in addition to the life preservers or other wearable life-saving devices required.

All lifesaving equipment must be in serviceable condition; wearable devices must be readily accessible, and devices to be thrown must be immediately available.

#### More than Six Passengers

Vessels carrying more than six passengers for hire are subject to a separate act and set of Coast Guard regulations (see Chapter 2, this page). These vessels must be “inspected” and certified as being equipped with the specified minimum equipment such as lifesaving gear and fire extinguishers.

## ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT FOR SAFETY

Any newcomer to boating might think that he would be fully set to go if he ordered his new craft with “all equipment required by federal and state regulations.” Actually, such is far from the real situation. Federal requirements stop too soon; state requirements—lacking uniformity—are not much help.

The list of items beyond federal requirements that you should have for safe boating is amazingly long. It is based on common sense and on the experience of many skippers over many years. Not every item will be required on every boat—the list must be tailored to your particular craft and boating activities—but you should at least consider each item discussed below.

#### Possible Liability

Another factor necessitating the carrying of equipment beyond the legal minimums is the possibility of liability in case of an accident. It is a mistake to think that the boating equipment specified by the government is the only equipment that you are legally bound to have aboard. Consider as well the far-reaching rules of negligence, as developed over the years in court cases. Technically, negligence is the unintentional breach of a legal duty to exercise a reasonable standard of care, thereby causing damage to someone. More simply stated, it is the failure to conduct oneself as a reasonable person would have under the circumstances. If, for example, a reasonable person would have carried charts, you may be liable to an injured party for an accident arising out of not having them available on board. If a reasonable person would have had an anchor, compass, lines, tools, and spare parts, etc., you may be held liable for not having them when needed. It is no defense to argue that no regulations require you to carry them.

### Personal Flotation Devices

Regulations set the minimum number and type of PFDs for your boat, but sound judgment often requires something better. Tests have shown that a Type II PFD may not keep your head sufficiently clear of the water in heavy seas—it’s better to have a Type I. If you ever expect to have multiple guests on board, make sure that you have enough for each person; if children might be involved, have several of the various sizes on your boat; see Figure 3-18.

Figure 3-18 Children do not float well in a face-up position and tend to panic easily. Type II PFDs are best for small children; an infant vest should have built-in rollover and head-support features.

The legal requirement is for one throwable device. You should consider whether one is enough, and maybe there should be one each of two or more different types, such as a buoyant cushion and a small life ring with a length of light line attached. This latter device can be used to either rescue a person in the water or to float a line over to a disabled boat that cannot be approached too closely because of shoal water, fire, or other emergency condition.

#### PFD Lights & Reflective Material

In order to better locate persons in the water at night, boats in commercial operation on certain waters must now carry personal flotation devices that are equipped with a light and reflective material—on both front and back sides—that will show up in the beam of a searchlight. Although such extras are not required for recreational boats, it’s a good idea for increased safety! Kits are available for adding reflective material to existing PFDs. A “water light” is a device that automatically comes on when it comes into contact with water; this makes a ring or horseshoe buoy much easier to locate at night; see Figure 3-19.

Figure 3-19 A water light is not legally required, but a light such as one that can be deployed with a horseshoe buoy will greatly increase the possibility of locating a person overboard at night.

A simple whistle attached to a PFD with a short cord is a valuable aid in nighttime rescues.

#### Life Rafts

Boaters who use colder northern waters or cruise more than a few miles offshore in any waters should consider the purchase of a life raft to supplement other lifesaving gear, though not required by the Coast Guard. Essential features include redundancy in buoyancy tubes, stowage on deck, gas cylinder inflation, water ballast or pockets, insulated floor, a canopy, boarding ladder and lifelines, a painter (to secure the raft to your boat so that it will not drift away), locator lights, adequate survival equipment and first-aid kit, a rainwater collector, a sea anchor or drogue, and an Emergency Position Indicating Radiobeacon (EPIRB). The raft should be able to accommodate the largest number of persons expected to be carried while offshore; more than one raft may be needed; see Figure 3-20.

Figure 3-20 Any skipper cruising offshore, especially in northern waters, should consider equipping his boat with a life raft. These are available in models for coastal cruising and distant voyaging. Life rafts must be maintained and periodically inspected in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications.

It is important to note that life rafts are categorized by the waters on which they are intended to be used. Inshore rafts are little more than buoyant platforms that will permit survivors of a sinking vessel to get out of the water. Coastal rafts should only be used in waters where rescue can be reasonably expected in one day—typically within 20 miles (VHF radio range) from shore—as they lack features for extended use. Offshore rafts extend this period to four to five days—they have canopies and multiple buoyancy tubes. Rafts that meet the international requirements for ships (SOLAS—Safety of Life at Sea Convention) are the highest category—these rafts are designed for survival of up to 30 days and have the most support features. Some rafts are not Coast Guard-approved but may be suitable for limited boating activities; some are approved, but only for certain categories of vessels. Others have full approval.

A four-person life raft is one rated to support four adults while it is half-inflated. It does not necessarily provide comfortable space for four persons; SOLAS/USCG standards require only four square feet per person, and unapproved rafts may provide even less. On the other hand, a raft loaded to capacity may be more stable and will be warmer in cold weather.

Even with today’s advanced search and location techniques, your predicament and location may not be known to rescue authorities. The latest models of EPIRBs (see this page) are excellent but not perfect. Weather may delay search and rescue for many hours. If you get into a life raft in an emergency, you should be prepared to spend an indeterminate time there.

Life rafts are cumbersome, expensive, and require costly annual inspections. But if you boat in any circumstances where a collision, fire, or sudden uncontrollable leak might place you and your crew in the water—away from other boats that might provide assistance, and drifting farther from shore—then you should have one. A life raft is not intended for use until an emergency occurs—but then it must work! It is of the utmost importance that life rafts are properly stowed and that they are serviced periodically at an authorized facility.

#### Lifelines, Safety Nets & Harnesses

Make sure everyone on board follows the traditional mariner’s advice: “One hand for yourself and one for the boat.” No matter how seasoned your sea legs, when the weather is rough, keep your center of gravity low as you move about the boat. Further ensure stability by grasping handholds.

On sailboats, lifelines serve as boundaries for the deck, particularly when children or pets are aboard. Many people reinforce those boundaries by rigging nylon netting along the lifelines (see Figure 3-21) or between the hulls of catamarans or trimarans. When small children are adventurous, however, or when the boat is pitching, rolling, or heeling, safety harnesses provide additional safety insurance; see Figure 3-22.

Figure 3-21 Netting rigged along the lifelines of a sailboat is an excellent safeguard against children or pets falling overboard.

Figure 3-22 A safety harness is added insurance against falls overboard, and enables you to know where your child is at all times on board a boat.

In addition to ensuring that you know a child’s whereabouts at all times, a safety harness is essential in other conditions for boaters of all ages. It will keep you aboard even if you fall, and should be worn anytime you are sailing alone, whenever any crew member is on deck in heavy weather, when going on deck alone at night while underway, when going aloft, or whenever you feel there is a danger that you might lose your footing.

Put on the safety harness before going on deck, and remember that a safety harness is only as strong as its attachment point. The best attachment point is a jackline, or jackwire—a bow-to-stern trolley-like wire on a sailboat deck, onto which safety harness tethers are securely clipped. In the absence of a jackline, a harness should be hooked to the windward side of the boat—only onto a sturdy through-bolted fitting (a cleat, winch, or stay, for example); the mast; or stainless steel eyes of a toe rail or a grab rail. Keep in mind that lifelines and stanchions cannot be relied upon to withstand a great deal of force; therefore, they are unsuitable attachment points.

When shopping for safety harnesses, choose only models designed for use on board a boat, with reinforced nylon webbing, stainless steel hardware, and a tested strength of at least 3,000 pounds. The harness should fasten at the chest, with a catch that responds only to firm, positive action for release; the USCG recommends quick-release-under-load catches and buckles. A harness should have a stainless-steel snap hook at the end of a tether no longer than 6 feet. If you attach a sailing knife to the harness, in a sheath and with a lanyard, you will always have a tool handy.

Each safety harness aboard your boat should be adjusted to fit the person who will wear it, then labeled to ensure quick identification when needed in an emergency. Stow your harnesses in dry places and inspect them regularly for wear and tear, along with your other safety equipment.

##### DON’T FORGET A PFD FOR YOUR PET

Although probably the best action is to leave pet dogs and cats ashore, some skippers just can’t bring themselves to do that. If you have a pet on board, it should have its own life vest. This device will provide both additional flotation and a means of retrieval by hooking with a boat hook. The flotation device should be worn at all times when it is on board, including when your boat is docked. Even if your pet is a good swimmer, animals that jump or fall overboard often become confused and swim away from your boat rather than toward it; strong currents can carry a pet away from a boat that is anchored or on a mooring. In either of these situations, the life vest will keep your pet afloat until you can get to it. The PFD must be properly sized, and the animal must be gradually introduced to wearing it; a cat will probably be more resistant to wearing a life vest than a dog.

### Fire Extinguishers

As with other required equipment, the regulations call for a very minimum of fire extinguishers; it would increase your safety if you carried additional units. If your boat is of the type or use category that does not require carriage of a fire extinguisher, you should consider carrying at least one unit, and two are not too many.

Extinguishers should be located around the boat where they will be close at hand if needed. One should be close to the helm and another in the galley. On many craft, it is desirable to have one in the engine compartment. It would add to the safety of your boat if an extinguisher were located close to the skipper’s bunk, where it could be grabbed quickly in the event of a nighttime emergency.

A fire extinguisher rated B-I by the Coast Guard can be as small as one that is rated 5-B:C by Underwriters Laboratories. The additional cost is minimal to upgrade to an extinguisher rated 10-B:C. Note that the Coast Guard requirement is for a B:C extinguisher—that is, one designed for fighting fires involving flammable liquids and usable on fires related to electrical circuits. As discussed earlier, there are also Class A fires, such as those that might occur in a trash basket, upholstery, or bedding. An even better extinguisher, one rated 1-A and 10-B:C, would add a capability to fight such fires of ordinary combustible material at only a slight increase in cost.

### Navigation Lights

The builder of your boat was required by the Coast Guard to install navigation lights that meet the minimum requirements of the Navigation Rules; see Figure 3-23. But perhaps you would want your craft seen at a greater distance when out boating at night. Have you ever tried to find out from how far away your boat could be seen and recognized for the type of vessel that it is? You might be surprised, and not pleasantly, at the results of such a test.

Figure 3-23 Make sure your navigation lights fully meet the legal requirements, and then a bit more. Check that each can be seen through the required arc, and not beyond those limits. Check the lights on your boat from a distance, from shore or by going out on another boat.

On smaller boats, especially open craft of the runabout type, there is often a problem with the white forward or all-round light. It is often not high enough to be seen from ahead, being blocked by a top or even by the bodies of people on board. Make sure such a light on your boat is mounted high enough—or, if mounted on a collapsible post, that it can be raised high enough—to be seen from any direction.

### Visual Distress Signals

If you meet the VDS requirement by carrying three hand-held flares, you are “legal” but hardly safe. Even if you are careful to wait until you feel sure there is someone within visible range, it is highly likely that you may use all your flares and still not be seen. Be safe: Carry more than the legal minimum of hand-held flares and consider having on board several red aerial flares that can be seen from a greater distance—or even better, red aerial parachute flares that will burn longer and be more likely to be seen than a meteor flare.

### Lines & Anchors

Even the smallest rowboat or dinghy needs at least one length of line for making fast to a pier, mooring, or anchor, and a 40-footer (12.2 m) will need some six or eight dock lines—yet none are required by Coast Guard regulations. No sensible skipper would venture far from shore without an anchor—but again, none is required.

The number and length of dock lines will naturally vary with the size of the craft on which they are carried; see Chapter 6, this page. A heaving line of light construction is desirable if your boat is large enough to need heavy mooring lines. The use of polypropylene line, or other material that is brightly colored and will float, is recommended for this purpose.

An anchor is a valuable safety item should the engine or steering fail and your boat be in danger of drifting or being blown into dangerous waters. Much more on anchors can be found in Chapter 9; see this page and 328 for information on the types of anchors and the size that should be on your boat. All but the smallest craft should consider carrying more than one anchor.

### Bilge Pumps

The list of required equipment does not include a bilge pump to get rid of water that comes in from rain, spray, or a leak in the hull. It has been said that there is no more effective “dewatering device” (to use a Coast Guard term) than a frightened boater with a bucket. Still, there is much safety achieved by having one or more electric bilge pumps, preferably backed up with an installed manual pump; see Figure 3-24. Bilge pump intakes should be fitted with a screen or filter to preclude any chance of becoming blocked by debris or loose objects in the bilge.

Figure 3-24 Electric bilge pumps are suitable for most boats, but have limited pumping capacity. The helm should have a panel light to indicate when the pump is running. Every boat with such pumps should have a manual pump of adequate size to provide additional pumping capability and to back up the electric pump in case of power failure.

An electric bilge pump can be a hazard as well as a “boatsaver”—the trouble is siphoning, which can happen if the bilgewater outlet is immersed below the surface of the outside water. To avoid an unsightly stain on the topsides, the outlet is usually just barely above the normal waterline. Should the craft ever settle deeper into the water, this outlet then is below the surface—a constant list or heeling could produce the same result. Siphoning is simply a backflow of water from outside the boat into the bilge—most undesirable. If there is an automatic switch for the bilge pump, water is first pumped out, and then siphoned back in, and the cycle repeats until the battery is dead. A check valve in the bilge pump output hose should prevent siphoning, but a better solution is to run the hose from the bilge pump upward to a high point, from where it makes a U turn downward to the outlet. The high point is vented, and this vented loop prevents a siphon from forming.

A very useful device is an indicator at the helm position that will show when a bilge pump is operating. If the inflow from a leak is greater than the pump can handle, and you are not aware that the pump is running, you might have a major emergency situation develop without warning. For additional safety, install a second automatic switch at a level a few inches above the primary pump’s switch, and connect it to a second pump and to an audible alarm, both at the helm and near the skipper’s bunk.

Smaller boats and dinghies should have a scoop-type bailer that can be bought ready-made or easily self-made by cutting down a gallon-size bleach bottle.

### Carbon Monoxide Detectors

Every boat that has enclosed spaces and uses gasoline for propulsion or generation of electrical power should be—must be—equipped with detectors for carbon monoxide (CO) gas. CO also results from the use of stoves, heaters, and charcoal grills. This completely colorless, odorless gas is a killer, one that cannot be detected by a human no matter how alert he or she may be. It requires a chemical or electronic detector to provide a safe environment; see Figure 3-25. This should be a unit that is designed specifically for marine use; it is calibrated differently than those for home use.

Figure 3-25 Carbon monoxide is a deadly threat on board any boat with gasoline engines for propulsion or generation of electricity, or open-flame cooking and heating stoves. Passive chemical detectors indicate a dangerous condition by a change in color. Only active electronic detectors that can give an audible alarm should be used in sleeping areas.

Carbon monoxide poisoning can be cumulative—over time, even low levels of CO can have harmful effects. Electronic sensors can be designed to recognize such a condition and sound both a visual and an audible alarm. Because chemical detectors indicate the presence of CO only by a change in color—having no sound alarm—they should not be used for the protection of sleeping compartments. These are relatively inexpensive but should be used only as supplemental detectors; they have an in-use life of one month but a shelf life in a sealed container of several years. ABYC (American Boat & Yacht Council) standards prescribe CO detectors on all new boats with gasoline engines; if yours is an older craft at risk, buy and install units for the safety of your self and crew.

Additional information on carbon monoxide hazards will be found in Chapter 11.

Figure 3-26 Despite natural and powered bilge ventilation systems, gasoline fumes can accumulate to a dangerous extent from fueling spills or a leaking line. Install an electronic gasoline vapor detector (it can detect other dangerous gases, too), but always back it up with the most sensitive detector, your nose!

### Gasoline-Fume Detectors

The required natural and powered ventilation systems and the use of ignition-protected electrical equipment provide a measure of protection from gasoline explosions and fires. An added measure of safety will come from the installation of a gasoline fume detector; see Figure 3-26. This will have one or more sensors in the engine and fuel tank compartments, with a display and alarm unit at the helm. Some models will additionally start the bilge blower(s); these do not interfere with normal manual control of blowers. Gasoline-fume detectors will also give the alarm in case of leaks of cooking fuels and some other gasses such as hydrogen from batteries overcharging.

### Compass

Although not required by the Coast Guard, a magnetic compass of adequate size is a definite safety addition to a boat of almost any size. Information on the selection, installation, and use of compasses can be found in Chapter 13.

### Charts & Navigational Tools

Large ships are required by law to have official nautical charts on board, but for recreational boats this is left to the discretion of the operator. The conscientious skipper, however, will always have at hand the proper charts for the waters he is traveling on. These, together with the appropriate navigation tools, will do much to ensure the safety of his craft and those on board. An electronic chart plotter is a handy device, but it should be backed up by a file of paper charts.

### Electronic Equipment

There are a number of items of electronic equipment that are not required by regulations, but which can be placed in the “essential for safety” category. These include a depth sounder and radio for almost all boats, and radar for larger craft. These are covered in detail in Chapters 16 and 20.

### Additional Operational Equipment

Other items of equipment are neither required nor directly related to the safety of your boat, but are necessary for its proper normal operation.

#### Fenders

An adequate number of fenders of a size appropriate to the size of the boat will prove useful in many different situations, such as normal docking or rafting up with another boat or boats; refer to Figure 1-31. One or two fender boards will often find use where a fender might not provide adequate protection to the boat’s hull.

#### Boathook

A boathook will be found very useful in fending off when docking or coming alongside another craft, for placing lines over piles, picking up pennants of mooring buoys, and many other activities. Some models enable you to substitute a mesh net for the hook at the outer end, and these are useful for retrieving items from the water.

#### Searchlights

A searchlight—mounted on larger boats, handheld on smaller craft—can be useful, even necessary, for nighttime operation of your boat; it can also be used as an emergency signaling device; see Figure 3-27. A large multicell flashlight can serve these functions, but not so well as a searchlight.

Figure 3-27 A searchlight can be aimed right or left, up or down, to make possible the detection at night of unlighted aids to navigation and objects in the water or on shore; it can also be used to illuminate the bow of the boat on which it is mounted. Do not point it toward the helm of another vessel, as it could temporarily blind the helmsman.

#### Windshield Wiper

Although windshield wipers may seem like minor equipment, they are highly valuable in rainy or misty conditions. Wipers may be operated by hand or electric motors. The best choice of wiper is a sturdy commercial model used by tugboats and commercial fishermen.

A “clear-view” screen is an effective but expensive alternative. This consists of a circular piece of glass spun at high speed by an electric motor; water is thrown off by centrifugal action.

There are also chemical products that, when rubbed onto a windshield, cause water to bead up and quickly run down the glass.

#### Lead Line

A simple hand-held lead line is valuable as a backup to an electronic depth sounder; see Figure 3-28. It is also useful when you have to probe around a stranded boat, either from on deck or by going out in a dinghy, to locate deeper water. Many lead weights used for this purpose have a hollowed-out space at the bottom in which can be placed wax or thick grease to bring up a sample of the bottom material, such as sand, mud, shale, etc. A pole or boathook marked with depth indications at one-foot intervals can serve a similar function in shallower waters; you can add a specially colored mark for the boat’s draft.

Figure 3-28 Considered old-fashioned by some, a lead line is handy as a backup to an electronic depth sounder and for determining the nature of the bottom. It can also be used for checking depths all around a boat that has gone aground.

#### First-Aid Kit

A first-aid kit should be on board every craft except the very smallest. The extent of its contents will be governed by the distance—actually measured in time—that your boating activities will take you from shoreside medical assistance. Additional information on first-aid kits can be found in Chapter 11.

#### Emergency Drinking Water

Every cruising boat, especially those that travel to relatively remote areas, should carry an emergency supply of potable water. This will be very valuable should the water pressure pumping system fail, or if a leak should drain the supply tank. (If your supply is contained in two or more tanks, never have more than one tank on line at any given time so that an undetected leak will not cause the loss of the total supply.)

A life raft should, of course, have a supply of drinking water in its emergency kit, but there should also be a small supply on board your dinghy in case you should ever get stranded with a failed motor.

Supplies of emergency drinking water should be dated when put on board and periodically replaced to ensure acceptable freshness when needed. There should also be a supply of distilled water on board for servicing storage batteries—this can also be used as drinking water if necessary.

#### Tools, Spare Parts & Consumable Supplies

The list of tools, spare parts, and consumable supplies is highly individualized by the size and type of the boat, the area and nature of its use, and the capabilities of its skipper and crew; see Figure 3-29. All that can be pointed out here is the vital need for careful study and list making.

Figure 3-29 Spare parts kits should include belts, filters, cables, and hoses, as well as items such as spark plugs. You should also carry at least one spare bulb for each navigation light and several spare fuses of each size used on board.

## EQUIPMENT FOR CONVENIENCE & COMFORT

Many, but certainly not all, of the items of equipment for convenience & comfort fall into the electronic or electrical categories. These items are covered more fully in Chapters 16, 19, and 20 and include navigational aids such as depth sounders, radar, and sophisticated positioning equipment such as GPS and chart plotters. Speedometers and logs will provide speed and distance information that will assist in piloting. An automatic steering mechanism—usually called an “autopilot”—adds greatly to the convenience and comfort of cruising. Loudhailers and intercom systems increase the convenience of operating or living on board larger boats. Twin-engine vessels will benefit from engine synchronization indicators, and will benefit even more from equipment that will match the engine speeds automatically.

Electrical equipment items include pressure freshwater systems, water heaters, electric stoves and microwave ovens, electrical refrigeration, showers with drain pumps, and heating and/or air-conditioning equipment.

An anchor windlass on the foredeck will remove a major part of the physical labor involved in “getting the hook up.” An electric anchor windlass is seen in Figure 1-29, just forward of the sampson post.

Although not required on diesel-powered craft, powered exhaust blowers can serve a very useful function after a day’s run. All engines, especially diesels, become hot when operating and radiate heat into the boat’s interior. This heat is reduced somewhat while the engine is running by the flow of induction air and cooling water, but when it has been shut down for the day, and no water is circulating, engine compartments and the boat in general can become very hot. Running an exhaust system for 10 to 15 minutes will remove this unwanted heat from the interior of the boat, increasing comfort and lightening the load on an air-conditioning system if one is on board.

All of this equipment requires increased electrical power from the boat’s system, either AC or DC. Auxiliary generating plants will permit the use of “shore-type” heavy-drain equipment underway or at anchor; see Figure 3-30. Inverters—converting DC battery power to AC—are very useful items that permit the operation of moderate-drain AC equipment, such as TVs, without the noise of running a gasoline or diesel engine-driven generator. Battery chargers will supply the needed DC power without operation of the main engine if AC power is available; these will keep the boat’s storage batteries at full charge when in port.

Figure 3-30 An auxiliary generating plant can provide a boat with “shore-type” electrical power underway or at anchor. This will allow the operation of many electrical appliances that otherwise could not be used on board.

Outside the electrical-electronic field, equipment items for convenience and comfort are numerous and varied. A boarding ladder is desirable when someone enters the water intentionally, a virtual necessity if someone falls overboard. A swim platform across the stern of medium-size and larger boats is a great convenience for swimming or using a dinghy. The dinghy itself, perhaps with sails or a small outboard motor, may well be classed as an item of convenience equipment.

A reverse osmosis watermaker will add immeasurably to a boat’s cruising endurance. Stabilizers are now available for medium and larger motor yachts to eliminate much of the rolling from offshore cruising. Bow (and stern) thrusters will greatly assist in the docking of larger craft.

Weather instruments—barometer, thermometer, anemometer, and perhaps a hygrometer for measuring the relative humidity—will add to the interest of boating. With study and practice, they can add to the safety, too, of a boat and its crew. A recording barograph will provide interesting permanent records of atmospheric pressure, and thus weather, changes.

The spare parts inventory of a boat can be expanded beyond the limits of necessity into the area of convenience. Carrying spare propellers, and even shafts, can often greatly reduce delays at a strange port away from home if these major components should become damaged. These may be beyond the capability of the crew to install, but their ready availability can often reduce repair times from days to hours.

Diving gear—either of the simple mask-and-snorkel style or the more complex scuba type—can make boating in many areas more interesting, and can at times be of real value in making underwater inspections and repairs. Wet suits may be required for colder water areas.

### Boating Insurance

Marine insurance can be bought to cover loss or damage to the boat or its equipment, protect against liability for personal injury or property damage, provide medical payments in case of injury, and cover transportation of the boat while on land. Consult a good agent. Better yet, talk to two or three agents for quotations.

NAVIGATION RULES

Lights & Day Shapes

Navigation Lights & Day Shapes Required by the U.S. Inland Navigation Rules for Vessels of All Types • The International Navigation Rules & How They Differ from Those for U.S. Inland Waters

The navigation rules, often referred to unofficially as the rules of the road, are sets of statutory requirements enacted by Congress to promote the safety of navigation. The rules consist of requirements for navigation lights and day shapes that are discussed in this chapter. They also include steering and sailing rules, sound signals for both good and restricted visibility, and distress signals, all covered in Chapter 5.

There are different sets of rules for international and inland waters, with some local variations in the latter. The first International Rules of the Road were established in 1889; the most recent ones, titled the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, were adopted in 1972. These are called the 72 COLREGS by the U.S. Coast Guard. Requirements generally apply to all boats of any size, unless specific sizes of vessels are stated to have differing requirements.

#### U.S. Waters

The 1972 International Rules have the status of an international treaty; previous sets of International Rules had the status of an international agreement. A treaty requires stricter compliance with its terms. A key provision of the 1972 International Rules was the requirement in Rule 1(b) that any national rules for internal waters “shall conform as closely as possible” to the International Rules. This meant that the U.S. Inland Rules no longer applied out to the offshore “boundary lines” but were effective only shoreward of new “demarcation lines” (see Chapter 2, this page). The longer-term effect was the passage by Congress of the Inland Navigation Rules Act of 1980, which unified the previously separate Inland, Great Lakes, and Western Rivers Navigation Rules and brought them into close conformity with the COLREGS. In 2010, the Coast Guard placed the U.S. Inland Navigation Rules into the Code of Federal Regulations, allowing updates through rulemaking rather than legislation.

State and local authorities may also issue regulations relating to boating, but these seldom relate to navigation lights and shapes.

#### Foreign Waters

Some foreign nations have their own navigation rules for internal waters. In Canada, these are the Collision Regulations: International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, with Canadian Modifications. In countries that have no national rules, the COLREGS govern on their internal as well as on external waters.

### Sequence of Consideration

Most recreational boaters in the United States use their craft on waters of rivers, lakes, bays, and sounds that are governed by the U.S. Inland Navigational Rules, and for this reason primary consideration will be given to these rules, with the International Rules being presented only in terms of their differences from the Inland Rules. The International Rules apply, however, to all vessels once they clear the jetties or headlands at a harbor entrance. Indeed, these International Rules even intrude into harbors, bays, inlets, and rivers in some areas along the New England and Northwest coasts and in the lower Florida Keys. Check your coastal chart for the location of the demarcation lines.

The consideration of the Rules of the Road in this chapter and in Chapter 5 is not complete; it focuses on the points of greatest concern to boaters.

#### Numbered Rules

Both the U.S. Inland Rules and the International Rules consist of major subdivisions: Part A—General; Part B—Steering & Sailing Rules; Part C—Lights & Shapes; Part D—Sound & Light Signals; and Part E—Exemptions. (Part E provided exemptions to permit a smooth transition from the previous requirements for lights and sound signals. Most such exemptions have now expired.)

Within both sets, rules are numbered from 1 to 38, with subparagraphs such as (a), (b), (c), and still lower levels indicated by (i), (ii), (iii). Rules that are identical, or nearly so, in both sets carry the same numbers. There is no rule in the U.S. Inland Navigation Rules corresponding to International Rule 28, but in order that parallel numbering can continue, that number is included with no entry.

##### KNOW AND CARRY THE NAVIGATION RULES

On inland waters, each operator of a self-propelled vessel, power or sail, state registered or documented, 12 meters (39.4 ft) or more in length must carry on board and have available for ready reference a copy of the Inland Navigation Rules. [1(g)] This requirement also applies to vessels of the United States, state registered or documented, on the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes.

The official text of the U.S. Navigation Rules, as well as the International Rules, is contained in the Coast Guard publication entitled Navigation Rules and Regulations Handbook (see Figure 2-03, this page). This book also contains sections on the demarcation lines, penalty provisions, vessel bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone communications.

Copies of Navigation Rules and Regulations Handbook can be purchased from some local sales agents or by mail, phone, or internet from the Government Printing Office (GPO) at 866-512-1800 or at bookstore.gpo.gov/help-and-contact.

The Navigation Rules are also available directly from the U.S. Coast Guard as the Amalgamated International & U.S. Inland Navigation Rules, at www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=NavRulesAmalgamated. This version includes the text common to the Inland and International Rules and explicitly notes the differences between them, whereas the Handbook merely contains the complete text of the International and Inland Rules side by side, leaving it to the reader to ferret out the differences. The Amalgamated Rules are also published in the United States Coast Pilots, and carrying a current United States Coast Pilot satisfies the requirement for carrying a current copy of the Navigation Rules.

Changes to the Navigation Rules are infrequent and usually minor. They are published in the Local Notices to Mariners and in the Notices to Mariners as they occur, and subsequently in revised versions of the Amalgamated Rules, the United States Coast Pilots, and the Handbook.

As of 2020, the U.S. Coast Guard allows U.S.-flagged vessels to use an electronic copy of the Inland Navigation Rules to meet carriage requirements on inland waters. The Rules must be previously downloaded so they can be displayed “for ready reference” without an internet connection, and they must be up to date. Other charts and publications that are required by regulation must be “currently corrected” with changes contained in all Notices to Mariners that are “reasonably available” to the vessel. Thus, although Rule [1(g)] does not explicitly say so, the prudent mariner who carries a printed copy of the Rules would likewise ensure that they are “currently corrected” with pen-and-ink changes.

#### Indication of References

In the discussions in this chapter and Chapter 5, numbers and letters shown in brackets are references to the applicable rule. References to annexes are indicated by a Roman numeral, since the annexes to both sets are so designated; specific paragraphs and subparagraphs are noted by numbers and letters as appropriate. These references are shown to facilitate looking up the exact language of the rules and annexes.

### Why Navigation Lights & Day Shapes

On a vessel, navigation lights are lights shown that are of specified color (white, red, green, yellow, blue), arc, range of visibility, and location, as required by law and regulations. Their basic purpose is to prevent collision by alerting each vessel to the other’s presence; see Figure 4-01. Lights also indicate the relative heading of one vessel as seen from another, and give clues to its size, special characteristics, and/or current operations. Most important is its orientation with respect to your boat—a fact you must know to determine which is the stand-on vessel (as defined on this page).

Navigation lights are sometimes referred to as running lights (those shown underway) and riding lights (those shown while at anchor or moored), but this terminology is unofficial and does not appear in the Navigation Rules.

In the language of the Navigation Rules, shapes are objects of specified shape, size, and placement on a vessel, as required by rules and regulations; all are black in color. These are often called “day shapes,” as they serve some of the same purposes by day that navigation lights do by night; see Figure 4-02. There are no day shapes corresponding to the basic running lights, as the relative aspect and motions of two vessels can be determined by observation. Rather, day shapes are used to indicate special situations such as being anchored or engaged in fishing, as well as some conditions not detectable by eye such as a sailboat with its sails up but with its engine also in use (such a craft is regarded as a power-driven vessel and is not entitled to any of a sailboat’s right-of-way privileges merely because its sails are up).

Figure 4-02 During the day, when lights would be ineffective, shapes (note the black balls and diamond aft of the mast) are used to indicate special vessel status. Other information that is provided at night by lights—type of vessel, size, and relative bearing—can be determined by direct observation in daylight.

#### Importance of Knowledge

Knowledge of navigation lights is important to a small boat skipper for two separate but equally important reasons. First, he is legally responsible for his boat displaying lights of the proper color, intensity, locations, and visibility. Although as of November 2003 manufacturers must install approved navigation lights on new boats, craft built before that date may or may not have lights that fully comply with legal requirements. Thus a boat owner must know the requirements of the applicable Navigation Rules and check that his boat fully complies. If it doesn’t comply, it is he—not the boatbuilder—who will be cited by the Coast Guard and possibly fined. He must also know which lights to turn on (and which not to turn on) for various situations, and when.

Second, he must depend on his knowledge of navigation lights for the safety of his boat when operating at night. Quite often, all the information available about another vessel is derived from interpreting its navigation lights. There are many lights and possible combinations; often a quick decision is needed, with no time to go “look it up in the book.” Know the lights shown on boats and ships. Even in the daytime and with good visibility, the day shapes carried by another vessel will give you information about its activities or limitations that you could not determine from simple observation. Know day shapes as well as lights.

## THE U.S. INLAND NAVIGATION RULES

The U.S. Inland Navigational Rules are applicable shoreward of the demarcation lines separating inland and international waters that have been established at entrances to bays, sounds, rivers, inlets, etc.; see Chapter 2. They are not applicable to waters of harbors that are specifically designated as not covered, as along coasts with many small harbors—including New England and Puget Sound—and especially the harbors of offshore landmasses such as Block Island, Catalina Island, and the lower Florida Keys.

The Inland Rules apply on the Western Rivers and the United States portions of the Great Lakes (see this page, for definitions of “Geographic Limits”). They also apply to U.S. vessels on the Canadian portion of the Great Lakes as long as there is no conflict with Canadian laws or regulations. [1(a)]

#### Basic Definitions

Rule 3 contains general definitions that are used throughout the U.S. Inland Navigation Rules.

Vessel This term applies to every size and description of water craft, including nondisplacement craft (air-cushion vehicles), WIG craft (defined on this page), and seaplanes, used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water. The term “vessel” includes all sizes without limit, from a dinghy or personal watercraft to a supertanker.

Power-driven Vessel Any vessel propelled by machinery.

Sailing Vessel Any vessel propelled by sail, provided that propelling machinery, if fitted, is not being used. A sailboat or motorsailer using both sail and engine simultaneously is a power-driven vessel for purposes of the Rules of the Road.

Underway A vessel not at anchor, made fast to the shore, or aground. This term applies whether or not the vessel is moving (“making way”) through the water. A drifting vessel is often said to be “underway with no way on.”

Vessel Engaged in Fishing Any vessel fishing with nets, lines, trawls, or other fishing apparatus that restricts maneuverability. It does not include vessels with trolling lines, or drift fishing with hand rods and lines.

Vessel Not Under Command A vessel that, due to some exceptional circumstance, is unable to maneuver as required by the Rules and therefore is unable to keep out of the way of another vessel. Typically, this category would apply to a boat drifting with an inoperative engine or steering system.

Vessel Restricted in Its Ability to Maneuver A vessel that, due to the nature of its work, is restricted in its ability to maneuver as required by the Rules and therefore unable to keep out of the way of another vessel. Typically this term applies to dredges, vessels engaged in laying or repairing submarine cables or pipelines, and vessels engaged in a towing operation that severely restricts the towing vessel and its tow in their ability to deviate from their course.

Visibility Vessels are deemed to be “in sight of one another” only when one can be observed from the other. A vessel is not considered to be “in sight” if it is observed on radar but cannot be seen visually.

Restricted Visibility Any condition in which visibility is reduced by fog, mist, falling snow, heavy rain, sandstorms, or any other similar cause.

Rule 3 also contains other definitions of interest to boaters. The term Secretary means the secretary of the department of the federal government in which the Coast Guard is operating. This is normally the Department of Homeland Security, but in time of war or national emergency, it could become the Department of the Navy by Presidential Executive Order.

#### Geographic Limits

Although separate sets of Rules of the Road for the Great Lakes and the Western Rivers no longer exist, these terms are still defined in the 1980 Inland Rules, because of certain exceptions and special provisions for specified waters.

The Great Lakes are defined as the lakes themselves, plus their connecting and tributary waters, including the Calumet River as far as the Thomas J. O’Brien Lock and Controlling Works (between mile 326 and 327), the Chicago River as far as the east side of the Ashland Avenue Bridge (between mile 321 and 322), and the St. Lawrence River as far east as the lower exit of the St. Lambert Lock.

Western Rivers means the Mississippi River, its tributaries, South Pass, and Southwest Pass to the demarcation lines for COLREGS waters; the Port Allen–Morgan City Alternate Route; and that part of the Atchafalaya River above its junction with the Port Allen-Morgan City Alternate Route, including the Old River and the Red River. Note that the term “Western Rivers” does not apply to rivers on the West Coast of the United States—such rivers as the Sacramento or the Columbia; the basic Inland Rules are in effect for all rivers emptying into the Pacific Ocean.

There are also portions of certain rivers and waterways that are “waters upon which certain inland navigation rules apply.” These are delineated in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 33, Part 89, Subpart B, and are listed in the Navigation Rules and Regulations Handbook.

#### Units of Measurement

Except for distances in nautical miles, linear units of measurement in the 1980 U.S. Inland Rules are given in the metric system. Specifications such as the lengths of vessels or the spacing and heights of lights will thus be in meters. The Coast Guard book on the Navigation Rules referred to earlier contains a conversion table for all metric values used in the rules. In this chapter and Chapter 5, the metric values of the rules are followed by customary (English) units in parentheses.

### Navigation Lights

Navigation lights are discussed for various categories and sizes of vessels in the subsections below; they are also presented graphically.

#### When Lights & Shapes Are Shown

Vessels are required to show the proper navigation lights from sunset to sunrise in all weather conditions, good and bad. During these times, no other lights that could be mistaken for lights specified in the rules can be displayed, nor any lights that impair the visibility or distinctive character of navigation lights or interfere with the keeping of a proper lookout. [20(a) and (b)]

The Inland Rules also state that navigation lights must be shown between sunrise and sunset in conditions of reduced visibility, and may be shown at any other time considered necessary. [20(c)]

Day shapes specified in the rules must be displayed by day; although not specifically stated, this has been taken to mean from sunrise to sunset. [20(d)]

Figure 4-03 Each type of navigation light covers a specific arc of visibility. Left to right: sidelights, sternlight, masthead light, all-round light. When the arcs are understood, the orientation of the vessel becomes clear.

#### Light Definitions

Masthead Light A white light placed over the fore-and-aft centerline of the vessel, showing an unbroken light over an arc of 225°, and so fixed as to be visible from dead ahead to 22.5° abaft the beam on both sides of the vessel; see Figure 4-04. On boats less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length, the masthead light may be off the fore-and-aft centerline but must be as close to it as possible. [21(a)]

Figure 4-04 A masthead light, shown at center in this photo, is white and covers an arc of 225°. It should be mounted high, but not necessarily at the top of a mast. Directly behind (left) is an anchor light.

As will be seen later, the term “masthead light” is something of a misnomer. More often than not, this light is not at the top of a mast. On motorboats it is often on a short staff on top of the cabin. On sailboats it is usually partway up the mast, and the anchor light or a tri-color light (see Figure 4-09) may be at the masthead.

Sidelights Colored lights—red on port and green on starboard—showing over an unbroken arc of the horizon of 112.5°, from dead ahead to 22.5° abaft the beam on each side; see Figure 4-05.

Figure 4-05 Sidelights (the red and green lights) on a vessel must each cover an arc of 112.5°, but not more. On the boat shown here, the side of the flybridge prevents the sidelight from being seen across the bow, a common failing of sidelights on many small craft. Sidelights must not be placed on the hull below the deck line.

Combination Light On a vessel of less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) length, the sidelights may be combined in a single fixture carried on the centerline of the vessel, except that on boats less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length, this combination light need be carried only as close to the centerline as possible. [21(b)] Note that the sum of the arcs of the two sidelights is exactly the same as that for the white masthead light; see Figure 4-06.

Figure 4-06 Vessels less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length may carry a combined bow light in place of separate sidelights. Each half covers the same arc as one sidelight, and the total is the same 225° as that for separate sidelights.

Sternlight A white light showing over an unbroken arc of the horizon of 135°, centered on dead astern; see Figure 4-07. [21(c)]

Figure 4-07 A white sternlight with a 135° arc centered on dead astern covers the directions not covered by the sidelights and masthead light. In boats less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length, the sternlight may be combined with the masthead light as a single all-round white light.

Towing Light A yellow light having the same arc as a sternlight, showing 67.5° to either side of dead astern. [21(d)]

All-round Light A light, color determined by its use, showing over an unbroken arc of the horizon of 360°. [21(e)] A large vessel may require two lights on opposite sides of a structure.

Flashing Light A flashing light at regular intervals, at a rate of 120 or more flashes per minute. [21(f)] This high flashing rate is used to lessen any possibility of confusion with quick-flashing lights on aids to navigation.

Special Flashing Light A yellow light flashing at a rate of 50 to 70 flashes per minute, placed as far forward and as nearly as practicable on the centerline of a tow, and showing an unbroken light over a horizontal arc of not less than 180° nor more than 225° centered on dead ahead. [21(g)]

### Lights for Various Sizes of Power-Driven Vessels Underway

The basic navigation lights for a power-driven vessel of less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length, when underway, are a white masthead light and a sternlight, each visible 2 miles, plus sidelights visible 1 mile. [22(c), 23(a)] The two white lights may be combined into a single all-round light [23(d)]; the sidelights may be separate or combined.

#### Masthead Lights

Vessels more than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length must have a masthead light and a sternlight; the two cannot be combined. The masthead light need not be at the masthead but must meet the placement rules of Annex I.

The masthead light of a vessel 12 meters (39.4 ft) or more but less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length must be at least 2.5 meters (8.2 ft) above the gunwale. [I-84.02(c)] On boats less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) long, the masthead light need only be at least 1 meter (3.3 ft) higher than the sidelights; it must be screened if necessary to prevent interference with the helmsman’s vision. [I-84.02(d)] and [I-84.05(b)]

On a vessel 20 meters (65.6 ft) or more in length, the masthead light must be not less than 5 meters (16.4 ft) above the hull. If the beam of the vessel is greater than 5 meters, the height must be not less than the beam but need not be greater than 8 meters (26.2 ft) above the hull. [I-84.02(a)] “Height above the hull” is defined as height above the uppermost continuous deck. [I-84.01(a)]

The masthead light must be in the forward half of the vessel, except that in boats of less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) length, it need only be as far forward as possible. [I-84.03(d)]

A second masthead light is required on vessels of 50 meters (164.0 ft) or more, and may be carried on shorter vessels [23(a)(ii)]. This must be at least 2 meters (6.6 ft) higher than the forward light. [I-84.02(a)(ii)]

When two masthead lights are carried, the horizontal distance between them must be at least one-fourth of the length of the vessel, except that this distance need not in any case exceed 50 meters (164.0 ft). [I-84.03(a)] Exception: Special provisions are made on the Western Rivers and other designated waters for vessels between 50 and 60 meters (164.0–196.8 ft) in length. [I-84.03(e)]

Value of Lights as a Range When two masthead lights are carried they form a range, a valuable aid in determining the relative heading of another vessel when it is first sighted at night. Since these white lights are both brighter and higher than the sidelights, they normally will be seen well before the colored light or lights can be detected and read for their meaning.

The relative location of the two range lights will be the key. Should they be seen one directly over the other, the other vessel is heading directly toward you and danger of collision may exist. Should the lower (forward) range light be seen to the right or left of the higher (after) white light, the other vessel is on an oblique course and the angle can be roughly gauged by the horizontal separation between the lights; see Figure 4-08.

Figure 4-08 When a vessel carries both forward and after masthead lights, these form a central range that is an excellent indicator of its heading as seen from your boat. If the lower (forward) light is to the left of the after light, the vessel is heading to your port. If the lower light is to the right of the other light, the vessel is heading to your starboard. When the two lights are directly in line, one above the other, the vessel is heading toward you. These lights will normally be seen well before the colored sidelights.

Visibility Requirements Masthead lights must have a range of visibility as follows: Boats less than 12 meters (39.2 ft) long—2 miles; vessels of 12 to not more than 50 meters (39.4-164.0 ft) in length—5 miles; except that it may be 3 miles for boats less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length; vessels over 50 meters (164.0 ft) in length—6 miles. [22]

In all cases, masthead lights must be placed so as to be clear of all other lights or obstructions. [I-84.02(f)]

#### Sidelights

Sidelights on a vessel of any length must be at least 1 meter (3.3 ft) lower than the (forward) masthead light; they should not be so low as to be interfered with by deck lights. [I-84.02(g)] On vessels of 20 meters (65.6 ft) or more in length, sidelights must not be forward of the forward masthead light. [I-84.03(b)] On vessels of such size, sidelights must be provided with mat black inboard screens to make the necessary cut-off of light at the “ahead” limit of each arc of visibility. [I-84.05(a)] Smaller vessels also must have these screens, if needed to meet the cut-off requirements, and to prevent excessive spillover from sidelights. A combination light using a single vertical filament bulb and a very narrow division between sectors need not have a screen.

Sidelights must have a range of visibility as follows: boats less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length—1 mile; vessels of 12 to 50 meters (39.4-164.0 ft) in length—2 miles; and vessels more than 50 meters (164.0 ft) in length—3 miles. [22]

#### Sternlights

The Rules and Annex I do not specify a vertical or horizontal placement for a sternlight, except that it be as nearly as possible “at the stern.” [21]

The required visibility for a sternlight is as follows: vessels less than 50 meters (164.0 ft) in length—2 miles; vessels 50 meters (164.0 ft) or more in length—3 miles. [22]

A power-driven vessel operating on the Great Lakes may show an all-round white light in lieu of the normal after masthead light and sternlight. This must be carried in the same position and have the same visibility range as a second masthead light would have. [23(e)]

### Lights for Various Sizes of Sailing Vessels Underway

A sailing vessel of any size underway—remember that, if any propelling machinery is in use, it is not a sailing vessel—will carry the same sidelights and sternlight as a power-driven vessel of the same length but will not carry a forward white masthead light. [25(a)]

A sailing vessel may additionally carry at or near the masthead two all-round lights in a vertical line, with the same visibility range as a sternlight, the upper being red and the lower green. [25(c)]

#### Sailboats Under 20 Meters

If a sailboat is less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length, the sidelights and sternlight may be combined into a single fixture at or near the top of the mast where it can best be seen. (The Rules do not so state, but “the mast” can be presumed to be the mainmast if there are more than two masts.) [25(b)] The use of a combination masthead light, however, is not permitted when any mechanical power is being used, since there is no way to carry a white forward light higher than the colored sidelights; see Figure 4-9. Carrying a three-color combination light also eliminates the use of the red-over-green optional light for sailboats, and a set of conventional lights would be needed for use when the boat was under mechanical power.

Figure 4-09 A sailboat less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length, while underway under sails alone, may show a tri-color light at or near the top of its mast. This combines the sidelights and the sternlight; no other navigation lights are shown. This light must not be used when under power, whether sails are hoisted or not.

A sailboat less than 7 meters (23.0 ft) long should carry normal sidelights and sternlight; but if this is not possible, it is sufficient to have an electric flashlight or lighted lantern ready at hand to be shown in time to prevent collision. [25(d)(i)] Again, if such a boat is operating under mechanical power, it must show the appropriate lights for a powerboat of its size.

#### Rowboats

A small boat propelled by oars may show the lights of a sailboat or have handy a flashlight or a lighted lantern to show to prevent a collision. [25(d)(ii)]

### Lights for Vessels at Anchor

A boat less than 7 meters (23.0 ft) in length, when at anchor not in or near a narrow channel, fairway, or anchorage or where other vessels normally navigate, need not show an anchor light. [30(e)]

Also, there are locations on U.S. inland waters designated as “special anchorage areas” where anchor lights are not required for vessels less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) long. [30(g)] These special anchorage areas are found frequently off yacht clubs and similar facilities. For a boater, they offer the possibility of legally leaving a boat unattended at a mooring without having an anchor light burning continuously or turning one on each sunset.

In anchoring situations other than those above, vessels less than 50 meters (164.0 ft) in length may show only a single all-round white light wherever it can best be seen [30(b)], or the two anchor lights that are mandatory for larger vessels; see Figure 4-10.

Figure 4-10 A vessel at anchor less than 50 meters (164 ft) in length must show a white all-round light where it can best be seen. Larger vessels must show one such light forward and another aft and lower. There are exceptions for very small boats and vessels in waters officially designated as a special anchorage. The day shape is a single black ball.

When two lights are used, the Inland Rules require a white all-round light in the fore part of a vessel at anchor plus a second all-round white light at or near the stern and lower than the forward light. [30(a)] The forward anchor light must be at least 4.5 meters (14.8 ft) above the other one. If the vessel is 50 meters (164.0 ft) or more in length, the forward light must be at least 6 meters (19.7 ft) above the hull. [I-84.02(k)]

Any vessel at anchor may, and a vessel of 100 meters (328.1 ft) and more in length must, also use the available working or equivalent lights to illuminate its decks. [30(c)]

### Vertical Spacing & Positioning

When the Rules require that two or three lights be carried in a vertical line, the vertical spacing must be not less than 1 meter (3.3 ft). For vessels 20 meters or more in length, International Rules require a vertical spacing of not less than 2 meters (6.6 ft). Where three lights are carried vertically, the spacing must be equal. [I-84.02(i)]

The lowest light on vessels less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length must be not less than 2 meters (6.6 ft) above the gunwale; on larger vessels, this height requirement is not less than 4 meters (13.1 ft). [I-84.02(i)] This standard of spacing and positioning applies to all lights arranged vertically (except towing lights), including lights on fishing vessels, vessels aground, pilot vessels, vessels restricted in their ability to maneuver or not under command, and the forward lights of towing vessels. The lower of the two all-round lights required on a vessel engaged in fishing must be at a height above its sidelights not less than twice the distance between the two vertically arranged lights. [I-84.02(j)]

### Lights for Vessels Aground

A vessel that is aground must show the normal anchor light(s) plus, if practicable, two all-round red lights arranged vertically. [30(d)]; see Figure 4-11. A vessel less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length is exempted from this requirement [30(f)].

Figure 4-11 A vessel 12 to 50 meters (39.4 to 164 ft) in length, when it is aground, must show a normal anchor light plus two all-round red lights. Smaller craft are not required to show these additional lights; larger vessels, over 50 meters (164 ft), show the usual two anchor lights as well as the red ones. The day signal is three black balls hoisted vertically.

### Lights on Barges at Bank or Dock

Rule 30(h) describes the circumstances requiring lights on barges projecting into a buoyed or restricted channel. Rule 30(j) describes the circumstances requiring lights on barges or groups of barges at anchor or made fast to one or more mooring buoys or similar devices. Basically, the Rules require all-round white lights visible for 1 mile.

### Lights for Towing

Vessels of any size that are either towing another vessel or being towed obviously have, because of this condition, much less maneuverability than vessels proceeding singly. To indicate this situation at night, special navigation lights are prescribed for vessels towing or being towed.

#### Towing Alongside or Pushing Ahead

A power-driven vessel when pushing ahead or towing another alongside must carry, in addition to its normal sidelights, two masthead white lights in a vertical line with standard spacing and positioning. [24(c)] These lights must be shown, but may be carried either at the position of the normal forward masthead light or that of the after masthead if used. However they are carried, the lowest after masthead light must be at least 2 meters (6.6 ft) above the highest forward light, to form an adequate range. [I-84.02(e)] Under the Inland Rules, in lieu of the normal white sternlight, it must carry two yellow “towing lights” in a vertical line, positioned so as to be showing astern [21(d)].

When a pushing vessel and a vessel being pushed ahead are “rigidly connected” as a composite unit, they are considered a single power-driven vessel and must position their masthead lights accordingly. This is not the same as a tug lashed to a barge ahead, no matter how tight the fastening cables are pulled in. [24(b)]

In inland waters, vessels towed alongside or being pushed ahead must show their own lights. On a vessel being pushed ahead or towed alongside, sidelights must be shown at the forward end plus a “special flashing light” (yellow) as defined in Rule 21 (g). When towed alongside, a sternlight is added. [24(f)]

Exception On the Western Rivers (except below the Huey P. Long Bridge on the Mississippi River) and on waters specified by the Coast Guard, the prescribed lights for a vessel pushing ahead or towing alongside are only sidelights and two towing lights carried one above the other. [24(j)] It is said that masthead lights are not required on Western Rivers because of the number of low bridges that towboats must pass under.

#### Towing Astern

If the length of a tow astern, measured from the stern of the towing vessel to the after end of the tow, is 200 meters (656.2 ft) or less, the towing vessel must carry two masthead lights in the same manner as for pushing ahead or towing alongside, plus sidelights, a sternlight, and one towing light above the sternlight. If the length of the tow is greater than 200 meters (656.2 ft), three masthead lights are carried in a vertical line, rather than two. [24(a)]

A vessel towed astern carries sidelights and a sternlight but no white forward lights. [24(e)]

An inconspicuous, partially submerged vessel or object must carry special lights rather than those just described. If it is less than 25 meters (82.0 ft) in beam, it must carry one all-round white light at or near each end; if it is 25 meters (82.0 ft) or more in beam, four all-round white lights at or near corners. If it exceeds 100 meters (328.1 ft) in length, it must have additional all-round white lights placed so that the distance between such lights is not more than 100 meters (328.1 ft.). [24(g)] These white lights must be visible for 3 miles. [22(d)] This rule exists to provide for the proper lighting of large liquid-filled bags (called “dracones”), log rafts, and other nearly awash objects.

Multiple vessels or objects towed alongside are lighted as a single vessel or object. [24(f)]

When it is impractical for a towed vessel to carry the prescribed lights, Rule 24(h) directs that all possible measures be taken to light the vessel or object being towed, or at least to indicate the presence of that vessel or object.

#### Small Boat Towing

Although the 1980 Inland Rules make no special provisions for small boats when towing, Rule 24(i) covers situations where towing is not the normal function of a vessel engaged in such work, and the towed vessel is in distress or otherwise in need of assistance. In this instance, all possible measures must be taken to indicate the relationship between the two boats, including the use of a searchlight to illuminate the towed vessel.

### Lights for Special-Purpose Vessels

Specific lights or combinations of lights are prescribed for various categories of vessels, so they may be more easily identified at night.

#### Fishing Vessels

A vessel engaged in fishing, whether underway or at anchor, must show only the lights specified in Rule 26; see Figure 4-12. Remember, however, that the definition of “fishing” does not include trolling lines.

Figure 4-12 By day, a fishing vessel, whether trawling or fishing by other means, must show a shape consisting of two cones point-to-point without vertical spacing. At night, the special fishing lights are green-over-white for trawling; red-over-white for other fishing methods.

A vessel engaged in trawling—dragging a dredge net or “other apparatus used as a fishing appliance”—must show two all-round lights vertically, green over white, plus sidelights and a sternlight when making way through the water. It must also carry a white masthead light abaft of and higher than the green light if it is 50 meters (164.0 ft) or more in length; shorter vessels may, but do not have to, carry this light. [26(b)]

A vessel engaged in fishing other than trawling shows red-over-white all-round lights, again with sidelights and sternlight, if making way. If there is outlying gear more than 150 meters (492.1 ft) horizontally from the vessel, an all-round white light must be shown in that direction. [26(c)] This light must be not less than 2 meters (6.6 ft) nor more than 6 meters (19.7 ft) horizontally away from the all-round red and white lights and must not be higher than the all-round white light nor lower than the sidelights. [I-84.04(a)]

In both cases just mentioned, the lower of the two vertical lights must be at a height above the sidelights not less than twice the spacing between the two vertical lights. [I-84.02(j)] The required visibility range is the same as for a sternlight. [22(b)]

A vessel that is fishing close by other vessels also fishing may exhibit the additional signals described in Rule 26(f). These signals would aid trawlers and purse seiners working in groups to coordinate their movements.

A fishing vessel not engaged in fishing will show the normal navigation lights for a vessel of its length. [26(e)]

#### Pilot Vessels

A pilot vessel, when on pilotage duty, does not show normal lights for a vessel of its size, but rather two all-round lights in a vertical line, white over red, at or near the masthead. These lights have the same visibility distance requirement as a sternlight, which together with sidelights, must be shown when underway. At anchor the pilot vessels show normal anchor lights as well as the white-over-red lights. [29(a)]

A pilot vessel not on duty carries only the normal lights for a vessel of its length. [29(b)]

### Lights for Vessels with Limited Maneuverability

The U.S. Inland Navigational Rules prescribe special lights for various types of vessels that have limited maneuverability because of their condition or their operations. [27]

#### Vessels Not Under Command

A vessel “not under command”—such as one with disabled engines, or one that for some reason cannot direct its movement in a specific direction—will show two red all-round lights vertically spaced where they can best be seen; see Figure 4-13. When making way through the water, such a vessel must also show sidelights and a sternlight but no masthead lights. [27(a)]

Figure 4-13 A vessel 12 meters (39.4 ft) or more in length and not under command (see text) shows two ball shapes vertically. At night, she shows two red all-round lights, plus sidelights and a sternlight if making way through the water.

#### Vessels Restricted in Maneuverability

A vessel of any size restricted in its ability to maneuver, except one engaged in mine-clearance operations, will show three all-round lights with standard vertical separations, red-white-red. Underway or at anchor the vessel will also show the usual lights for that status. [27(b)]

A vessel engaged in a towing operation that severely restricts the tow’s ability to deviate from its course will show normal towing lights, plus red-white-red vertical lights. [27(c)] It is not intended, however, that vessels engaged in routine towing operations can declare that they are restricted in their ability to deviate from their course.

In addition to the red-white-red lights, a vessel engaged in dredging or underwater operations involving an obstruction to navigation will also show two vertically spaced red all-round lights on the side on which the obstruction exists and two green all-round lights, one above the other, on the side on which it is safe to pass; these lights shall be at the maximum practical horizontal distance, but never less than 2 meters (6.6 ft) from the red-white-red lights, and the upper light of these pairs must not be higher than the lower red light. A vessel of this category will not show anchor light(s) but will show underway lights, if applicable. [27(d)]

Dredge pipelines that are floating or supported on trestles must display lights at night and in periods of restricted visibility. There must be yellow lights along the pipeline, approximately equally spaced and no more than 10 meters (32.8 ft) apart when a pipeline crosses a navigable channel; when the pipeline does not cross a navigable channel, the lights must be sufficient to clearly show the pipeline’s length and course. Each light must be visible for at least 2 miles all around the horizon, flash 50 to 70 times per minute, and be located not less than 1 meter (3.3 ft) nor more than 3.5 meters (11.5 ft) above the water. There must also be two all-round red lights (not flashing) at each end of the pipeline, visible for at least 2 miles and 1 meter (3.3 ft) apart vertically, with the lower red light at the same height above the water as the flashing yellow lights. [27(d)(iv)]

#### Diving Operations

Whenever the size of a vessel engaged in diving operations makes it impractical to exhibit all the lights prescribed in Rule 27(d) above, it must instead show three all-round lights, placed vertically, red-white-red; see Figure 4-14. [27(e)]

Figure 4-14 A boat engaged in diving operations at night that restrict its ability to maneuver must show three lights vertically, red-over-white-over-red. During the day, it must show a rigid replica of the code flag A not less than 1 meter in height; flying a cloth flag is not adequate to meet the requirements of the Rules. Though official only in some states, a flag of red field with a white diagonal stripe is often used by divers.

#### Mine-Clearance Vessels

A vessel engaged in mine-clearance operations (often called “minesweeping”) will show, in addition to all normal underway lights for a power-driven vessel, three green all-round lights. One of these will be at the foremast head and one at each end of the foreyard. These lights indicate that it is dangerous to approach within 1,000 meters (1,094 yds) of the mine-clearance vessel. [27(f)]

#### Smaller Boats

Boats less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length, except when engaged in diving operations, are not required to show the lights of Rule 27, but larger craft must comply. [27(g)]

#### Not Distress Signals

The various lights of Rule 27, especially those for vessels not under command, should be understood by other vessels as signals of limited maneuverability, not as signals of vessels in distress and requiring assistance. [27(h)]

### Miscellaneous Provisions of the Rules

Rule 1(b) of the Inland Rules allows vessels equipped with lights meeting the requirements of the International Navigation Rules to use such lights on inland waters in lieu of the lights specified by the 1980 Inland Rules. Lights must be complete for one set of Rules or the other—no mixtures. (Consult the Coast Guard publication Navigation Rules and Regulations Handbook for the applicable provisions of the International Rules.) This option is of value to the owners of boats that may be operated outside the Inland Rules demarcation lines at night, since it eliminates any need for making a change in lights when going from one body of water to the other.

The navigation lights of the International Rules are permitted on inland waters, but not vice versa; a boat lighted for the Inland Rules may be in violation when proceeding seaward of the demarcation lines.

Any vessel, when passing under a bridge, may lower any light or day shape if it needs to. When clear of the bridge, the lights or day shapes must be repositioned immediately. [20(f)]

#### Alternative Compliance

When vessels of special construction or purpose cannot fully comply with the number, positions, ranges, or arcs of visibility of lights or shapes specified by the Rules, they must comply as closely as possible. [1(e)] This applies to a vessel designed or modified for a special function with inflexible demands. The Coast Guard determines the closest compliance and issues a Certificate of Alternate Compliance for non-naval vessels. Certificates for naval vessels are issued by the Secretary of the Navy.

Boaters should be aware that the light characteristics of naval and other special-purpose vessels may vary to some extent from norms. For example, the two masthead lights on an aircraft carrier are considerably to starboard of the vessel’s fore-and-aft centerline, and a large naval vessel that cannot comply with the horizontal masthead separation requirement may appear to be a smaller vessel at night.

#### Special Rules for Navy Ships

Rule 1(c) allows the Secretary of the Navy to make rules for special station or signal lights to be used by ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy. These lights may sometimes be shown in combination with navigational lights but will be as distinct as possible from them. Such additional station and signal lights are described in the “Special Notice to Mariners Paragraphs” section in the first publication each year of Notice to Mariners. One example is a submarine identification light as shown in Figure 4-15.

Figure 4-15 Because U.S. submarines are large vessels, but with little above-the-water surface, a special identifying light has been established for them—an all-round flashing amber (yellow) light that flashes once a second for three flashes, off for the next three seconds, then repeating.

#### Signals to Attract Attention

The Inland Rules authorize a vessel to make light or sound signals to attract the attention of another vessel, provided that such actions cannot be mistaken for one of the normal lights or signals. A vessel may also direct the beam of its searchlight toward a danger, but not in such a way as to impede the navigation of any other vessel. [36] See Distress Signals in Chapter 5, this page.

#### Air-Cushion Vessels

An air-cushion vessel, when operating in the nondisplacement mode (“flying”), must show the normal navigation lights for a vessel of its length, plus an all-round flashing yellow light where it can best be seen. [23(b)]. There are no special lights for hydrofoil vessels.

#### Wing-In-Ground Craft

A wing-in-ground (wig) craft is defined as a multimodal craft which, in its main operational mode, flies in close proximity to the surface by utilizing surface-effect action. WIG craft look similar to seaplanes, but can only fly close to the surface and are capable of operating at speeds in excess of 100 knots. A WIG craft must show the normal navigation lights for a vessel of its length, and in addition—when taking off, in flight near the surface, and landing—a high-intensity all-round flashing red light. [23(c)] Where it is impractical for a WIG craft to show normal navigation lights, it must show lights “as closely similar in characteristics and position as possible.” [31]

#### Lights for Seaplanes

A seaplane is defined as including any aircraft designed to maneuver on the water. [3(a) and (e)] Seaplanes, while on the water, are thus in theory required to show the same lights as a ship of the same size. Because this will probably be impractical, the Rules offer an exception allowing them to show lights “as closely similar in characteristics and position as is possible.” [31]

#### Technical Details for Lights

Annex I to the U.S. Inland Rules also contains highly technical specifications for the “chromaticity” (color specifications) of navigation lights, and for the necessary luminous intensity to achieve the various ranges of visibility specified in the Rules. Specifications are also included for horizontal and vertical sectors, so that adequate light brightness is maintained fully over the specified arc, yet rapidly decreases outside the set limits. The requirements for horizontal sectors are the same for all vessels, but the vertical sector specifications for sailing vessels differ from the requirements for power-driven vessels. When buying lights, specify the type and size of the vessel they are intended for.

### Day Shapes

In the interest of collision prevention and greater overall safety on the water, the Navigation Rules prescribe a number of shapes for certain situations and categories of vessels. Objects of specified shape and minimum size are used in the daytime, when lights are ineffective. The general requirements for the display of shapes are given in the numbered rules, with details of configuration, size, and placement set forth in Annex I. Shapes shall be black and of the following sizes:

Ball Diameter of not less than 0.6 meter (2.0 ft).

Cone Base diameter not less than 0.6 meter (2.0 ft) and height equal to base diameter.

Diamond Two cones, each as above, base to base.

If more than one shape is hoisted, they shall be spaced at least 1.5 meters (4.9 ft).

Small Boats Vessels less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length may display smaller shapes scaled down to be commensurate with the vessel’s size; the vertical separation may be correspondingly reduced. [I-84.06]

#### Vessels Under Sail & Power

A vessel proceeding under sail in the daytime, when also being propelled by machinery, must carry forward, where it can best be seen, a black conical shape with its point downward. Under Inland Rules only, a vessel of less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) length is not required to exhibit this shape, but may do so. [25(e)] This day shape signals that such a vessel is not entitled to a sailboat’s Rule 18 right-of-way privileges even though its sails are set; see Figure 4-16.

Figure 4-16 A vessel with both sail and mechanical propulsion must show a cone shape, point down. Inland Rules exempt sailboats less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length, but on waters subject to the International Rules, all sailboats must comply regardless of length.

#### Vessels at Anchor or Aground

Although larger vessels must display certain shapes by day whenever they are at anchor or aground, this does not apply to small boats in most situations. Vessels under 7 meters (23.0 ft) in length need show no shape if they are not at anchor in or near a narrow channel or fairway, anchorage, or where vessels normally navigate. [30(e)]

Vessels under 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length need not display shapes when at anchor in a special anchorage area [30(g)]. Vessels less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length are not required to show shapes when aground. [30(f)]

In all other situations, vessels at anchor must hoist a ball shape forward where it can best be seen; see Figure 4-17. [30(a)] This is the signal displayed by the large vessels whenever at anchor. Similarly, a vessel 12 meters (39.4 ft) or longer aground must display three ball shapes in a vertical line; refer to Figure 4-11. [30(d)]

Figure 4-17 Vessels at anchor by day must hoist a ball shape. Boats less than 7 meters (23.0 ft) anchored clear of traffic need not show this shape. Craft less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length are also exempted if in a designated “special anchorage area” (U.S. inland waters only).

#### Vessels Towing & Being Towed

Between sunrise and sunset, a power-driven vessel having a tow astern that is longer than 200 meters (656.2 ft) must carry a diamond shape where it can best be seen. [24(a)]

In such cases, the vessel being towed must also show a diamond shape where it can best be seen. [24(e)]

#### Vessels Engaged in Fishing

Vessels engaged in fishing by day must indicate their occupation by displaying, where it can best be seen, a shape consisting of two cones in a vertical line with their points together (in this case only, no vertical separation between the two shapes). [26(b) and (c)] These shapes are used on vessels engaged in either trawling or in fishing other than trawling (but not on vessels trolling or drift fishing); refer to Figure 4-12.

If its outlying gear extends more than 150 meters (492.1 ft) horizontally from the vessel, a vessel engaged in fishing, other than trawling, will show a day shape of a single cone, point up, in the direction of the outlying gear. [26(c)]

#### Vessels 12 Meters or More with Limited Maneuverability

A vessel not under command will show as a day signal two black balls one above the other; refer to Figure 4-13. [27(a)]

A vessel “restricted in its ability to maneuver” will hoist three shapes in a vertical line, ball-diamond-ball; refer to Figure 4-02. [27(b)]

A vessel engaged in a towing operation that severely restricts the tow’s ability to deviate from its course, will show the ball-diamond-ball shapes, in addition to any other required day shapes. [27(c)]

Vessels engaged in routine towing operations, however, cannot declare that they are restricted in their ability to deviate from their course.

A vessel engaged in dredging or underwater operations when an obstruction to navigation exists will hoist two balls vertically on the side on which the obstruction exists, with two diamond shapes on the side on which another vessel may pass. [27(d)] If the size of a vessel engaged in diving operations makes it impracticable to exhibit these shapes, it shall show instead a rigid replica of the International Code flag A (white and blue, swallow-tailed) not less than 1 meter (3.3 ft) in height, arranged to ensure all-round visibility; refer to Figure 4-14. [27(e)] This requirement for visibility in any direction will normally require multiple rigid “flags” in a crisscross or square arrangement. An A flag—made of cloth—is not an acceptable substitute for the “rigid replica” required by the Rules.

While there is no official recognition in the International or U.S. Navigation Rules for the familiar “diver’s flag”—rectangular red with one white diagonal slash—it is still advisable to fly it in the close vicinity of any persons engaged in diving as a warning to other craft to stay clear; this can be done by mounting the flag on a small float that moves along with the divers. Some state laws require that the red-and-white flag be flown when there are divers in the water; it should not be flown routinely when this condition does not exist. The A flag replica relates only to the status of a vessel and is not required, nor should it be displayed, if maneuverability is not limited, such as by having divers connected by hoses and lines.

A vessel engaged in mine clearance will show three balls, one at the foremast head and one at each end of the foreyard; these have the same significance as the green lights shown at these positions at night. [27(f)]

### Pilot Rules for Inland Waters

The Pilot Rules for inland waters under the 1980 Inland Rules are found in Annex V.

The Pilot Rules contain certain additional provisions for navigation lights:

#### Law Enforcement Vessels

Law enforcement vessels of the United States and of each state and their political subdivisions, may display a flashing blue light when engaged in direct law enforcement activities. This must be located so as to not interfere with the visibility of the vessel’s navigation lights. [V-88.05]

#### Public Safety Vessels

Vessels engaged in government-sanctioned public safety activities, and commercial vessels performing similar functions, may display an alternately flashing red-and-yellow light; this must be a single light, not two separate red and yellow flashing lights. Typically, these are small craft patrolling an authorized regatta, race, or similar marine event, and small towing assistance vessels; other examples are fire and rescue boats, search and rescue craft, and medical assistance vessels [V-88.07]

This special light does not replace—nor should it be located as to interfere with—normal navigation lights. It is only a means of identification and does not convey any special privileges. Vessels showing this light must abide by all applicable Navigation Rules and not presume that they have any precedence or right-of-way.

##### PENALTIES

The Navigation Rules do not include provisions for penalties, but the U.S. federal law that makes them effective does provide stiff penalties for violations. An important aspect of these penalties that is not widely understood is the concept that the vessel can also be penalized in rem, or “under the law” (see below). Under several penalty provisions, it is possible for the operator, the owner, and the vessel itself to be penalized.

Theoretically, this could result in an owner paying several penalties for the same violation. Additionally, many boating actions could be violations of state or local laws and subject to nonfederal penalties.

###### OPERATION IN VIOLATION OF THE RULES

Any person “who operates a vessel” in violation of either the Inland or International Rules, or any regulation issued thereunder—and this includes the various annexes—is liable for a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each violation. The vessel may also be subject separately to a similar penalty.

It should be noted that this penalty is not a “fine” requiring conviction in a federal court, but it is a civil forfeiture imposed by the Secretary or his delegate. The penalty may not be assessed until the person charged has received notice of the violation and had an opportunity for a hearing. The Secretary or his delegate may remove or mitigate any penalty assessed. If a penalty, as finally determined, is not paid, the matter can be taken to a Federal District Court for collection and/or appropriate action.

###### NEGLIGENT OPERATION

Anyone operating a recreational vessel in a negligent manner (which can include a careless action that endangers a person or property) is liable to a civil penalty of as much as $5,000.

###### GROSS NEGLIGENT OPERATION

Anyone operating a vessel in a grossly negligent manner is committing a Class A misdemeanor.

###### DUTIES IN AN ACCIDENT

A vessel that is involved in a collision (“marine casualty”) must render assistance to anyone else involved in the accident, as long as such assistance can be done without endangering the passengers, crew, or the vessel rendering aid.

The operator (“master”) must give his or her name and address and the identification of the vessel to anyone else involved in the accident.

Anyone who fails to provide assistance and/or who does not provide proper identification is subject to a fine of up to $1,000, imprisonment for up to 2 years, or both. The vessel is also liable to be fined in rem.

###### OBLIGATION TO RENDER ASSISTANCE

Anyone who encounters another person or vessel at sea who is in need of assistance must render that assistance as long as it can be done without endangering the passengers, crew, or the vessel rendering aid. Anyone who fails to provide such assistance is subject to a fine of up to $1,000, imprisonment of up to 2 years, or both.

###### THE “GOOD SAMARITAN” PROVISION

Anyone who complies with the required duties listed above, or who gratuitously and in good faith renders assistance at the scene of an accident or other boating casualty without the objection of any person being assisted cannot be held liable for any civil damages as a result of rendering assistance, or of any act or omission in providing or arranging salvage, towing, medical treatment, or other assistance where the individual acts as an ordinary, reasonable, and prudent person would have done under the circumstances.

###### PENALTIES AGAINST VESSELS

In maritime law, a vessel itself can be held to be in violation and be subject to penalties if operated contrary to any provision of the Inland Navigational Rules Act of 1980 or regulations issued thereunder, including the annexes. The same maximum penalty, $5,000 for each violation, can be assessed, and in this case the vessel may be seized and proceeded against in any Federal District Court. The same procedures for due notice and hearings are available to the owner of a vessel charged with a violation as are available to individuals as described above.

The law also allows the withholding or revocation of U.S. Customs clearance for any vessel whose owner or operator is subject to a penalty for violation of the Inland Rules. This is an important consideration for foreign vessels operating in U.S. waters. If penalty proceedings are not complete before the vessel’s sailing date, clearance may be granted upon the filing of a bond or other surety satisfactory to the Secretary.

## INTERNATIONAL NAVIGATION RULES

Careful study of the 1980 U.S. Inland Rules of the Road provides an excellent basis for understanding the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972—the formal name for what are generally called the International Rules of the Road, or 72 COLREGS. The International Rules were made applicable to U.S. waters and U.S. vessels by Presidential Proclamation and subsequent Act of Congress. The 1972 International Rules consist of 38 numbered “rules,” grouped together into the same “parts” as for the U.S. Inland Rules, plus four “annexes” (the International Rules do not have Pilot Rules, the fifth annex of the U.S. Inland Rules). Some of these rules and annexes relate to lights and day shapes, and are discussed here. Other rules and annexes are concerned with right-of-way, whistle signals, and distress signals; these are considered in Chapter 5.

#### Applicability

The International Rules, as established under the U.S. authority, apply to vessels in two situations:

• To all vessels in waters within the United States sovereignty, outside the prescribed demarcation lines at entrances to bays, rivers, harbors, etc.; see this page. In the absence of demarcation lines, they are also applicable within bays, harbors, and inlets, along specified stretches of coasts, and up the connecting rivers to their limits of continuous navigation.

• To all U.S. vessels on the high seas not subject to another nation’s geographic jurisdiction.

Although the International Rules state that they are applicable “Upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels” [1(a)], there is a provision for a nation to prescribe its own rules for harbors, rivers, and inland waterways [1(b)]; this is the basis for the U.S. Inland Rules.

#### Manner of Presentation

The 1980 U.S. Inland Navigation Rules were derived from the 1972 International Rules, and nearly match them rule for rule, and annex for annex, in format. Considerable effort was taken to make the language identical wherever possible. Where there are differences, they exist because different operating conditions on the inland waters of the United States require rules for safety of navigation different from those applicable on the high seas. On inland waters, vessels are generally smaller in size and the distances are less. The International Rules, of course, do not contain the several special provisions for the Great Lakes or Western Rivers.

Thus, the consideration of the International Rules for lights and day shapes can be limited to the relatively few points of difference. Where a difference is not noted, the International and 1980 U.S. Inland Rules are identical, except for minor editorial modifications of no significance to vessel operation.

Figure 4-18 A power-driven vessel less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length may have an all-round white light in lieu of the masthead and stern lights under both Inland and International Rules.

### Navigation Lights

The requirement for showing navigation lights and day shapes is the same for waters governed by the International Rules as for those where the U.S. Inland Rules apply.

#### Definitions

The International Rules definitions do not include a “special flashing light”—the yellow light used at the bow of barges pushed ahead on inland waters.

The International Rules do include a definition not used in the Inland Rules. A “vessel constrained by her draft” is considered a power-driven vessel that, because of her draft in relation to depth and width of navigable water, is severely restricted in her ability to maneuver.

#### Lights for Power-Driven Vessels Underway

Small craft with sidelights flush-mounted in the hull below the rub rail do not comply with the International Rules requirement that such lights be above the “uppermost continuous deck.” A power-driven vessel under 7 meters (23.0 ft) in length whose maximum speed does not exceed 7 knots may, instead of a masthead light and stern light, exhibit an all-round white light and shall, if practicable, exhibit sidelights. [23(d)(ii)]

#### Lights for Vessels Anchored or Aground

The International Rules contain no provision for special anchorage areas as established in inland waters.

#### Lights for Vessels Towing

A vessel pushing a tow ahead or towing alongside must show a normal white stern light (rather than two yellow towing lights in a vertical line, as required by Inland Rules). [24(c)] A vessel pushed ahead or towing alongside will not carry the special flashing yellow light used at the bow of such barges on inland waters.

#### Lights for Vessels Constrained by Draft

International Rule 28 permits a vessel that is “constrained by her draft” to show three red all-round lights in a vertical line wherever they can best be seen; see Figure 4-19. (This is the rule that is omitted from the U.S. Inland Rules.)

Figure 4-19 Only the International Navigation Rules recognize a vessel “constrained by her draft”; this category does not appear in the Inland Rules. At night, such a vessel shows three all-round red lights arranged in a vertical line; by day, it exhibits a cylindrical shape.

### Day Shapes of the International Rules

International Rule 25(e) requires the use of a cone, with point downward, as a day shape on all sailing vessels using machinery for propulsion while its sails are up. There are no exceptions in this rule for smaller sailboats.

International Rule 28 permits a vessel “constrained by her draft” to show a day shape consisting of a cylinder. The cylinder must be not less than 0.6 meter (2.0 ft) in diameter with height twice the diameter.

## GENERAL CAUTIONS

Although they are not strictly a part of the Inland or International Rules or their annexes, several other navigation light matters should be considered by every skipper.

### Interpreting What You See

All that has gone before in this chapter has related to what lights are placed where on various vessels. If you have learned this, great—but that is only the beginning! You must also learn how to interpret the navigation lights that you see when you are underway at night—and for your safety, learn it well.

If you see a red navigation light on the other vessel, you immediately know that it is the stand-on vessel and you must yield—that’s why it is red.

If you see two or three white vertical lights, that could be a tug with a tow astern. Look for the lights on the towed vessel, and don’t try to pass between the tug and its tow.

And there are other lights and combinations of lights that you must be able to instantly recognize—the lights for a sailboat that is privileged over a motorboat, the special lights of various fishing vessels, a dredge, or a vessel not under command. Study the requirements for navigation lights from the viewpoint of a “looker” as well as a boat owner.

#### Certification of Navigation Lights

The U.S. Coast Guard now requires boat manufacturers to install on boats that they build only navigation lights that have been certified as meeting the requirements of the Navigation Rules with respect to color, arc of coverage, and intensity. They must also be installed so that they meet requirements of those rules when in use.

Craft constructed prior to November 2003 may or may not (all too often “not”) meet the specifications contained in the Rules and their annexes. Even lights that do meet the design requirements are often installed improperly. The most frequent discrepancy is a sidelight that can be seen across the bow, sometimes by as much as 30 or more degrees. Such improper lights, usually on smaller boats, make it difficult or impossible at night to determine the heading of that craft. Another frequent problem is an all-round white light at the stern that is too low, so its light is blocked by persons on board, a canvas top, or other structural part of the boat, and it cannot be seen by another craft traveling in the opposite direction. See this page.

#### Misuse of Navigation Lights

Boats are often seen underway at night showing both running lights and the anchor light. This presents a confusing picture to another boat approaching from astern of the first vessel—two white lights such as would be seen from ahead of a larger vessel under the Inland Rules. This illegal situation is usually caused by carelessness on the part of the skipper—he turned on one too many switches! Check your lights each time you turn them on.

Another problem is the Class A (less than 16 feet) or 1 (16 to 26 feet) boat at anchor that shows its combination red-and-green light as well as its all-round white light aft. Here the illegal situation is caused by the manufacturer who installed only one switch for all navigation lights—making it impossible for the boat to show only the white light as an anchor light without also showing the red-and-green sidelights. The solution is for the skipper to install a second switch or a single switch with two separate “on” settings so that the colored and white lights may be controlled independently.

#### Maintenance of Navigation Lights

Lights should always be checked before leaving dock if night operation is scheduled. Many boats are used only in the daytime, but the wise skipper checks all navigation lights once a month—whether they have been used or not. One or more spare bulbs and fuses, each of the proper type and size, should always be on board.

It is common for the color of plastic sidelight lenses to begin to fade after a few years of service. Red lenses tend be affected most noticeably, often to the point where the light through a faded lens appears almost white. It is the owner/operator’s responsibility to replace faded lenses to ensure that the sidelights show their proper colors.

##### INTERPRETING NAVIGATION LIGHTS

The following pages are designed to help you sort out lights in the dark and guide you in identifying the boats associated with them. Refer to the legend at right: the colored text gives information on the International Rules where they differ from the Inland Rules (otherwise, they agree).

# CHAPTER5

Figure 5-01 Many boating areas are relatively open, and boats may approach from more than one direction, often several at a time. Every skipper must know who has the right-of-way and what signal to give in each situation.

NAVIGATION RULES

Right-of-Way & Sound Signals

Actions to Take & Signals to Sound to Avoid Collision • Sound Signals Required in “Thick” Weather when Underway or at Anchor • Distress Signals

Most of us have had the experience of walking down a street and meeting another pedestrian headed toward us. We turn to one side to avoid hitting him, only to have him dodge simultaneously to the same side. Then perhaps there’s a quick turn by both in the opposite direction, followed by a collision, or we manage to pass without hitting. To pedestrians on a sidewalk such actions are merely comical, and fairly simple to avoid. Between vessels on the water, they are serious indeed, and boaters need to understand and follow the applicable Navigation Rules to avoid collisions.

Except for marked channels, there are no clearly defined paths for boats to follow. They have an open expanse of water on which to navigate, and their courses often cross the tracks of other vessels on the same waters. The caution needed on the water, even though traffic is much less than on land, is thus as or more important than on sidewalks, streets, and highways.

“Ignorance of the law is no excuse” applies to boating as well as activities on land. Skippers of boats of all sizes have been found liable for substantial criminal and civil penalties when they ignored or violated right-of-way rules. Before paying claims, insurance companies may ask skippers to prove that they operated their craft in accordance with the Navigation Rules.

More important, knowing and obeying the Rules can save your life and the lives of your family and guests on board. Whether you operate a boat 60 feet (18.3 m) in length or a personal watercraft, knowledge of the Navigation Rules is a must.

### Rules & Regulations

To prevent collision, carefully considered rules clearly state the duty of the skipper of any vessel encountering another vessel. These rules are of three general classes: the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (known as the 72 COLREGS); the U.S. Inland Navigational Rules; and regulations issued by departments and agencies of the federal government. Most of the latter category are promulgated by “the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating,” or by the Commandant of the Coast Guard, under authority delegated to him by the Secretary. The principal federal regulations are the five annexes to the Inland Rules, including Annex V, Pilot Rules.

State & Local Regulations Both the International and Inland Rules are focused on the prevention of collisions between vessels. They do not cover matters such as “no wake” zones or the operation of watercraft near swimming beaches. These types of regulations are the responsibility of state and local authorities. In general, such special regulations conform to the Inland Rules and Coast Guard regulations, but elaborate on certain minor details. The wide variety of such regulations makes it impossible to consider them here, except to remind all skippers to be alert for them.

Many states have regulations prohibiting boat operation in restricted areas above and below dams. The towing of waterskiers may be restricted in some waters. Boats are often prohibited from operating within a specified distance, usually 100 yards, of craft displaying a state-recognized “diver down” flag. State laws may give public safety vessels displaying the appropriate flashing blue light a right-of-way over other vessels.

#### Foreign Waters

Some foreign nations have their own set of navigation rules for internal waters. In Canada, these are the Collision Regulations: International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, with Canadian Modifications. Many other countries have no national rules, and in these the COLREGS govern internal as well as external waters.

### Sequence of Consideration

The U.S. Inland Navigational Rules will be considered in detail here. They apply on waters shoreward of demarcation lines at the entrances to most, but not all, harbors, bays, rivers, and inlets (see this page). They thus apply to most recreational boaters in the U.S.

The International Navigation Rules will be discussed in detail only where their provisions differ significantly from the U.S. Inland Rules. As discussed in Chapter 4, the Inland Rules are derived from the International Rules and closely parallel them; the various provisions are matched rule for rule and annex for annex. Many rules are identical, but in a number of instances the content and language has been changed to reflect the generally smaller size of vessels and shorter distances involved in inland waters; in a few places an editorial change has been made for greater clarity.

Annexes I, III, and IV differ from their International Rules counterparts in a few minor ways. International Rules Annex II is included in Inland Rule 26(f). Inland Rules Annex V has no International counterpart.

The consideration of the Navigation Rules in this chapter and Chapter 4 is not complete; it focuses primarily on points of greatest interest to boaters.

Figure 5-02 If every skipper knew the “Rules of the Road” as he should, it would do much to bring calm to what can otherwise be chaotic situations.

#### Numbered Rules

Both the U.S. Inland Rules and the International Rules consist of major subdivisions; Part A—General, Part B—Steering and Sailing Rules, Part C—Lights and Shapes, Part D—Sound and Light Signals, and Part E—Exemptions. (Part E provides specific temporary and permanent exemptions for grandfathered vessels to permit a smooth transition from the previous requirements for lights and sound signals. Most of these exemptions have now expired.)

Within both sets, the rules are numbered from 1 to 38, with subparagraphs such as (a), (b), (c), and still lower levels indicated by (i), (ii), (iii). Rules that are identical or nearly identical on both sets carry the same numbers, so that parallel numbering can be continued in the rules that follow. (Rule 28 is omitted from the U.S. Inland Rules.)

#### Indication of References

In this chapter and Chapter 4, numbers and letters shown in brackets are references to the applicable Rule. References to Annexes are indicated by a Roman numeral, as the annexes to both sets of Rules are so designated; specific paragraphs and subparagraphs are noted by numbers and letters as appropriate. These references are shown to facilitate looking up the exact language of the Rules and Annexes in the U.S. Coast Guard publication Navigation Rules and Regulations Handbook.

## THE U.S. INLAND RULES

The rules covered in this chapter are in addition to those in Chapter 4. Taken together, they make up the sum of the two sets of Navigation Rules. The term “right-of-way” is not used in the text of the Rules (except in certain circumstances on the Great Lakes, Western Rivers, or waters specified by the Secretary), but it is commonly understood language and will be used in the following discussion.

#### Definition of Terms

The definitions of the Inland and International rules that were discussed in Chapter 4 on this page are equally applicable in this chapter. Additional definitions follow:

Whistle Any sound-signaling equipment capable of producing the prescribed blasts, and which complies with the specifications in the Annex III. [32(a)]

Short Blast A blast of about one second’s duration.

Prolonged Blast A blast of four to six seconds’ duration. (The term “long blast” is not used in the Navigation Rules.)

The geographic limits of rule applicability to the Great Lakes, the Western Rivers, and specified waters described in Chapter 4 are similarly applicable to this chapter.

#### “Privileged” & “Burdened” Vessels

For generations, skippers have used the terms burdened and privileged to define the status of two vessels encountering each other. The privileged vessel is the one that has the right-of-way—the right to proceed unhindered by the other. The burdened vessel is the one that does not have the right-of-way, the one that must take any necessary action to keep out of the way of the privileged vessel.

These terms do not appear in the 1972 International Rules and the Inland Rules—but the concept remains. Officially, the privileged vessel is now the stand-on vessel; the burdened vessel is the give-way vessel. (Although these terms are used in the titles of Rules 16 and 17, they are not included in the definitions of either set of Rules.) The new terms were adopted as they were considered to be more descriptive of the required actions. The terms “burdened” and “privileged” continue in use by maritime personnel on an informal basis.

### Steering & Sailing Rules

The basic purpose of any set of rules of the nautical road is to prevent collisions (indeed, this is the title of the International Rules). A major subdivision, Part B, termed “Steering and Sailing Rules,” is particularly aimed at that goal, with three subparts covering conduct of vessels in any condition of visibility [Rules 4-10]; when within sight of each other [Rules 11-18]; and when in restricted visibility [Rule 19]. Part C covers lights and shapes; Part D, sound and light signals, emphasizing collision prevention. [Rules 32-37].

Technically, the right-of-way rules do not come into effect between two vessels until the possibility of a collision exists; see Figure 5-03. Stand-on and give-way status are not necessarily established when vessels first sight each other, but rather at the moment when a “risk of collision” develops. Although not an actual rule, a basic principle of collision prevention is that where the depth of the water permits, two vessels should never get so close to each other that the risk of a collision can materialize. A collision between two vessels is almost impossible if each skipper fully and properly obeys the Navigation Rules.

Figure 5-03 In a crossing situation, keep a check on the relative bearing of the other craft. To be safe, there should be a distinct change in this angle, forward or aft, as the boat approaches you; a constant or only slowly changing bearing indicates a risk of collision.

#### Determining Risk of Collision

Every vessel shall use all available means appropriate to the prevailing conditions to determine if risk of collision exists. If there is any doubt, such risk shall be deemed to exist. [7(a)]

Every vessel must at all times maintain a proper watch by sight and hearing, as well as all available means appropriate in the prevailing conditions so as to make a full appraisal of the situation and of the risk of collision.[5]

An excellent method (and prescribed by the Rules) of determining whether your boat is on a collision course with another is to watch the compass bearing of the other vessel; see Figure 5-04. If this bearing does not change appreciably, either forward or astern, a risk of collision exists. [7(d)] The Navigation Rules then apply, and appropriate action must be taken.

Figure 5-04 These sketches illustrate a typical developing situation. Even without the use of a compass, another vessel can be “eyeballed.” On first sighting (A), this freighter gives no clue as to its speed. The small-boat skipper lines it up with the windshield and the corner of the companionway.

In B, the ship seems to be falling behind the bearing line. If the small boat has kept a constant speed and heading since the first sighting, it will pass ahead of the freighter.

In C, however, the ship has pulled ahead of the bearing line, and collision is possible. The small boat is actually the stand-on, but it would be extremely risky and foolish to try and claim that right.

In D, a collision appears probable. The small craft should have altered course, speed, or both in order to prevent this situation from occurring. Survivors of collisions between ships and boats are nearly always those persons who are on the ship.

Boaters are cautioned, however, against presuming there is no risk when there is an appreciable change in bearing. Each situation must be considered in light of its own conditions. [7(d)]

In reduced visibility, you must make proper use of any operational radar equipment on board, including long-range scanning, and of radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects. [7(b)]

Do not make assumptions on the basis of scanty information, especially scanty radar information. [7(c)]

#### Safe Speed

Clearly, the safe speed for a motorboat operating on a little-traveled waterway in the middle of a week may be completely different than the safe speed for the same boat in a crowded harbor on the Fourth of July weekend. The prevailing circumstances and conditions are quite different, and that’s just what the Rules want you to take into account. Every vessel must proceed at a safe speed at all times. [6]

Rule 6(a) lists specific factors to be considered in determining a “safe speed,” including but not limited to:

• The state of visibility;

• Traffic density, including concentration of fishing or other vessels;

• Your vessel’s maneuverability, with special reference to stopping distance and turning ability;

• At night, the presence of background lights, such as those from shore or from the backscatter of your vessel’s own lights;

• The state of wind, sea, current, and the proximity of navigational hazards;

• The vessel’s draft in relation to the available depth of water.

Rule 6(b) provides additional guidance for determining a safe speed for a ship or boat fitted with an operational radar.

#### Actions to Avoid Collision

The Rules specifically require that any action taken to avoid collision, if the circumstances allow, will be positive, made in ample time, and in keeping with good seamanship. Any change of course or speed should be large enough to be readily apparent to the other vessel visually or by radar; avoid a series of small changes. Your. judgment—your “seaman’s eye”—may tell you that only a slight change will be sufficient, but that change might well go undetected and leave the other skipper in doubt; see Figure 5-05. With some boats, particularly those with displacement hulls, a change of course is preferable to a change in speed, as the latter is less likely to be noticed.

Figure 5-05 All changes of course in the presence of another vessel should be so pronounced and definite that they will be noticed and properly evaluated by the other skipper. Slight changes may fail to make your intentions clear. Changes in speed are often less noticeable than changes in course

The action taken must be sufficient to result in passing at a safe distance; continue to check its effectiveness until the other vessel is clear. If you have to, you must slow down or take all way off by stopping or reversing. [8]

### Basic Responsibilities

Two Navigation Rules are of such primary importance that every skipper should know them by heart. These are “the rule of good seamanship,” and “the general prudential rule.”

#### The Rule of Good Seamanship

Rule 2(a) is the broad, summing-up rule of good seamanship. It provides that nothing in the Rules shall exonerate any vessel, or its owner, master, or crew, from the consequences of failing to comply with the Rules, or of neglecting any precaution that may be required either by the ordinary practice of seamen or by the special circumstances of the case. Whatever you can do to avoid a collision, you must do!

#### The General Prudential Rule

Rule 2(b) is often termed the general prudential rule and is of great importance due to its wide applicability. In obeying and construing the Rules of the Road, due regard must be given to all dangers of navigation and collision, and to any special circumstances, including the limitation of the vessels, that may render a departure from the Rules necessary to avoid immediate danger. The Rules must not be literally, blindly followed into a collision.

Interpretation of “Dangers” Courts have placed considerable emphasis on the word “dangers” of Rule 2(b) in rendering their decisions. The basic principle is that the Rules must not be abandoned whenever perceptible risk of collision exists, but only when imperatively required by special circumstances, as when the actions of one vessel alone will not avoid a collision.

#### Lookouts

Every vessel must at all times maintain a proper lookout by sight and hearing, as well as by all other available and appropriate means, to keep fully appraised of the situation and any risk of collision. [5] This lookout must be all around—360°.

The need for a proper lookout is often taken too lightly on small boats. In most situations, a helmsman will satisfy this need, but he must be qualified, alert, have no other responsibilities, and be able to see in all directions; see Figure 5-06. The use of an automatic steering mechanism (an “autopilot”; see Chapter 16) is not justification for the absence of a human helmsman at the controls, continuously observing and ready to take over immediately if needed. The use of radar at night or in fog does not justify the absence of an additional person on deck, stationed outside and usually forward, where he can hear as well as see.

Figure 5-06 It is the responsibility of the skipper of a boat of any size that a proper lookout is maintained at all times. Failure to do this raises serious questions of liability in case of an accident.

The noise level of most motorboats can make the helmsman ineffective as a listening watch.

The Rules do not prohibit operating with a short-handed crew or even boating single-handed for a reasonable length of time. It is not the intent of Rule 5 to require additional personnel forward if none is needed for safety. The burden of proof, however, will continue to be on each vessel involved in a collision to establish that a proper lookout could not have prevented the accident.

### General Right-of-Way Provisions

Except for vessels specifically designated otherwise—such as vessels in narrow channels and Traffic Separation Schemes and those overtaking—vessels may be “ranked” for right-of-way as follows:

• Vessels not under command

• Vessels restricted in ability to maneuver

• Vessels engaged in fishing

• Sailing vessels

• Power-driven vessels

Each type of vessel in this list must yield right-of-way to vessels listed higher, and will be stand-on with respect to those lower on the list. [18] Rules 9, 10, and 13 cover the exceptions.

#### Caution Required

Be aware that not all skippers know the Rules! Be prepared to take whatever steps are necessary to avoid collision, even if technically your boat is the stand-on vessel.

### Actions by the Give-way Vessel

Actions by a vessel that is required by the Rules to keep out of the way of another vessel (a give-way vessel) are simple and straightforward: “So far as is possible, take early and substantial action to keep well clear.” [16]

### Actions by the Stand-on Vessel

The vessel that has the right-of-way must maintain its course and speed, at least initially. [17] But the stand-on vessel is never allowed to proceed blindly into a collision. The best way to think of the stand-on vessel’s responsibility is as a three-stage action:

Stage One The approaching vessel on a collision course is still some distance away. The stand-on vessel must at this time keep its course and speed to allow the other vessel full opportunity to maneuver. [17(a)(i)]

Stage Two The other vessel, which is required to give way, continues approaching and is getting uncomfortably close. It appears that it does not realize the situation and is not intending to maneuver. At this point, the stand-on vessel may maneuver to avoid a collision. [17(a)(ii)] If the stand-on vessel chooses to maneuver, however, it must not alter course to port for a vessel on its own port side. [17(c)]

Stage Three The separation between the vessels continues to decrease and the situation becomes one in which no action by the give-way vessel can avoid a collision. At this point, the stand-on vessel is required to take any action that is necessary to avoid a collision. [17(b)]

It should be noted that Rule 17 does not relieve the give-way vessel of its obligation to keep out of the way of the stand-on vessel.

### Sound Signals

Sound signals are to be used only when vessels are in sight of each other and are meeting or crossing at a distance within half a mile of each other. [34] These signals must never be used in fog or other conditions of reduced visibility; where the vessels are not visible to each other by eye, only the fog signals of Rule 35 may be sounded at such a time.

##### “THE RULE OF TONNAGE”

The Inland and International Navigation Rules must be interpreted with common sense. A collision between a large steel ship and a fiberglass boat of almost any size will not result in equal damage and casualties on both vessels. This harsh reality leads to the very unofficial “Rule of Tonnage” that says that small, lightweight craft should always avoid close-quarters situations with big ships of heavy tonnage. In the language of the Rules, in many cases all vessels are equal, but in actuality “some are more equal than others.”

The speed of a large ship first seen at a distance can be difficult to judge, particularly when viewed head-on. Large tankers and containerships often travel at four or more times the speed of a sailboat or trawler-type powerboat. A dot on the horizon can become a close-quarters situation in less than 15 minutes. The time between first sighting and collision can shrink to a minute or less in reduced visibility. Small craft must look out all around the horizon, not just ahead.

Installing larger, brighter navigation lights greatly improves the possibility of a small boat being seen. Flags, sails, and other equipment on board must never be allowed to obscure navigation lights, especially a sternlight.

Large vessels use radar for collision avoidance, but this is no guarantee that a nonmetallic boat will be visible on the screen. Sea clutter and other natural phenomena can prevent the echo from a small boat being detected. A radar reflector, mounted high and in the “catch-rain” orientation, increases the size of the radar echo returned to the ship, making the craft more visible on the display on the ship’s bridge.

A boat can make itself more visible at night by shining a light on its deck or cabin, or onto its sails. If the approach of a large ship becomes uncomfortable, an attempt to communicate should be made on VHF Channel 13 or 16 (or 70 using DSC, see this page). Finally, small craft should always consider the advisability of making major course changes to avoid a close-quarters situation with a large ship. Sailboats should start their auxiliary engine in preparation for motoring out of harm’s way.

#### Danger Signal

Five or more short, rapid whistle blasts is a signal of warning. The term “danger signal” was removed from the Inland Navigation Rules in 2018 because vessels may use this signal when simply in doubt about—as opposed to immediate danger from—the intentions of another vessel. However, “danger signal” is a commonly recognized term and is used in this discussion; see Figure 5-07. [34(d)]

Figure 5-07 The danger signal is five (or more) short blasts sounded rapidly. It is used when danger is evident or there is doubt about another vessel’s actions or intentions. Here, the boat on the right is backing into danger.

A skipper also uses this signal to indicate that he considers an action proposed by another vessel dangerous to either vessel—such as a negative reply to a proposal to pass in a certain manner.

Giving a danger signal does not relieve a vessel of its obligations or responsibilities under any rule.

Although not specifically covered in the Rules, a careful skipper who either hears or sounds a danger signal will at once slow or stop his vessel until the situation is clarified for all concerned.

#### Equipment for Sound Signals

The term “whistle” dates back to the beginning of steam propulsion for ships. Today, the Navigation Rules accept not only a steam whistle but also an air horn or electric horn to make the required signals. Annex III of the Rules specifies the tone of the whistle for various sizes of vessels—the smaller the vessel, the higher the pitch of the whistle or horn. A vessel pushing another vessel or vessels, or towing alongside, may sound a whistle whose characteristics are determined by the combined length of the tug and tow.

A vessel 12 meters (39.4 ft) or more in length must have a whistle; a vessel 20 meters (65.6 ft) or more in length must also have a bell; and a vessel of 100 meters (328.1 ft) or more in length must also have a gong, the tone and sound of which cannot be confused with those of the bell. [33(a)]

A vessel less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length need not carry the sound-signaling equipment required on larger vessels, but if it does not, it must have “some other means of making an efficient sound signal.” [33(b)]

Annex III contains detailed specifications for sound-signaling equipment, including whistle tones and ranges of audibility. Higher pitched tones are used for smaller vessels; for those of less than 75 meters (246.1 ft) length, the band of frequencies is 250 to 700 Hz. Required ranges of audibility gradually increase, from 0.5 mile for vessels less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length, to 2 miles for vessels longer than 200 meters (656.2 ft); all distances are coordinated with specific sound pressure levels (loudness). [III-86.01] A vessel normally used for pushing ahead or towing alongside may carry a whistle with characteristics matched to the length of the longest towed-and-towing combination customarily operated, and may use it even when operating singly. [III-86.01(h)] The annex specifies directional properties and positioning for whistles, and a limitation on sound pressure level at the vessel’s own “listening posts” (lookout or helm position). [III-86.01(d) and 86.01(e)]

All bells and gongs must be made of corrosion-resistant material and be designed to give a clear tone. Specifications for bells and gongs include different sizes for smaller and larger vessels and a minimum sound-pressure level. Bells on vessels 20 meters (65.6 ft) or more in length must be at least 300 mm (11.8 inches) in diameter. The mass of the striker for any size of bell must not be less than 3 percent of the mass of that bell. [III-86.02]

The bell or gong or both on a vessel may be replaced by “other equipment” (usually electronic) having the same sound characteristics, provided that the prescribed signals can always be sounded manually as well. [33(a)]

#### Maneuvering Lights

Whistle signals may be supplemented by a light signal synchronized with the whistle; the flashes have the same significance as the whistle blasts. This is a single all-round light, white or yellow, visible for at least two miles regardless of the size of the vessel. [34(b)] This maneuvering light must be placed in the same vertical plane as the masthead light(s), at least 0.5 meter (19.7 in) above the forward masthead light, and at least 0.5 meter (19.7 in) above or below the after masthead light. If a vessel carries only one masthead light, as will be the case for nearly all small craft, the maneuvering light can be carried where it can best be seen, but not less than 0.5 meter (19.7 in) vertically separated from the masthead light. Remember that a maneuvering light is an all-round light and should not be significantly obscured in any direction. [I-84.18]

### Rules for Power-Driven Vessels Underway

The Navigation Rules recognize three types of encounters between two approaching vessels—meeting, crossing, and overtaking; see Figure 5-08. The rules governing right-of-way, the whistle signals to be given, and actions to be taken with regard to course and speed changes, are given below for power-driven vessels underway. Remember that a boat being propelled by both sails and machinery is considered in the Navigation Rules as a power-driven vessel.

Figure 5-08 The Navigation Rules recognize three types of encounters. The dark blue boat here is being overtaken by one boat and crossed by another while it meets a third. Specific provisions of the Rules govern the actions taken and signals given by vessels in each of these situations.

#### Meeting Situation

When two power-driven vessels are approaching one another head-on, or nearly head-on, this is a meeting situation. In this situation, unless otherwise agreed, each should pass on the port side of the other. [14(a)] Neither vessel has the right-of-way over the other, and both must alter course to starboard, if necessary, to provide sufficient clearance for safe passage; see Figure 5-09. This is exactly the same, it will be noted, as for two cars meeting on a narrow road. This is colloquially referred to as a “port-to-port” or a “one whistle” passing.

Figure 5-09 In a typical meeting situation, both vessels alter course to starboard and pass port-to-port. Either can signal first with one short blast; neither has the right-of-way. On inland waters only, a starboard-to-starboard passing can be proposed by either boat with two short blasts, but should not be executed until the other boat responds in kind.

For the rule of the meeting situation to apply, two requirements must be met: the vessels must be meeting in such a manner as to involve risk of collision, and they must be on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses. Such a situation is deemed to exist by day when a vessel sees the other ahead or nearly ahead, and by night when it can see the masthead lights of the other in a line or nearly in a line, or sees both sidelights. [14(b)] Court interpretations and decisions over the years have established an arc of one point (11.25°), with half on either side, as the practical boundaries of the zone within which vessels will be considered as meeting each other.

This rule does not apply to two vessels that will, if both keep on their respective courses without change of heading or speed, pass clear of each other.

When a vessel has any doubt that a meeting situation exists [14(c)], it must assume the situation does exist and act accordingly; that is, change course to starboard, slow down, or stop.

In a winding channel, a vessel may first sight the other at an oblique angle rather than “head on, or nearly head on.” Nevertheless, the situation is to be regarded as a meeting situation since they will be head on or nearly head on when the actual passing occurs. Each should keep to its own right side of the channel and neither has the right-of-way over the other.

Exception A power-driven vessel operating on the Great Lakes, the Western Rivers, or other waters designated by the Secretary, and proceeding downbound with the current, has the right-of-way over an upbound vessel. The downbound vessel proposes the manner of passing and initiates the whistle signals. [14(d)] In other waters where there is a significant current, although not required by the Rules, it is customary for a vessel proceeding against the current to yield to one traveling with the current.

Signals When power-driven vessels are within sight of each other and meeting at a distance of a half-mile or less, each vessel must sound the whistle as follows:

One short blast, meaning “I intend to leave you on my port side.”

Two short blasts, meaning “I intend to leave you on my starboard side.”

Three short blasts, meaning “I am operating astern propulsion” (engines in reverse gear, but it is not necessary that the vessel be moving astern).

Upon hearing the one- or two-short-blast signal from the other, a vessel will, if in agreement, sound the same signal and do what is necessary to effect a safe passage. If it doubts the safety of the proposed maneuver, it must sound the danger signal of five or more short, rapid blasts and take appropriate precautionary action until a safe passage agreement is made. [34(a)] The rule does not state which vessel should signal first—both boats are on an equal basis, and either can make the first signal to the other.

Note that a vessel should never answer a one-blast signal with two blasts, nor a two-blast signal with one blast. This is known as cross signals and can only lead to confusion and a hazardous situation. Answer a signal only with the signal received or with the danger signal.

When one vessel sounds the danger signal in a meeting situation, both vessels should immediately stop or reduce their forward speed to bare steerageway. [8(e)] Neither vessel should attempt to proceed or pass until agreement is reached through the exchange of the same whistle signal, either one short blast or two.

#### Crossing Situation

When two power-driven vessels are meeting but not head-on or nearly so—i.e., when each has the other more than 10° or so off its bow but forward of a direction 22.5° abaft the beam—a crossing situation exists.

When two power-driven vessels are crossing so as to involve risk of collision, the vessel that has the other on its own starboard side must avoid crossing ahead of and must keep out of the way of the other. [15] See Figure 5-10.

Figure 5-10 When two power-driven vessels encounter each other not in a meeting situation but with each having the other forward of a direction 22.5° abaft the beam, the boats are crossing. The vessel that has the other on its starboard side is the give-way (burdened, colored dark blue) vessel and must take action to avoid collision. It can slow down, stop, or turn to starboard (but never to port!). The stand-on (privileged) vessel should maintain course and speed unless the other vessel fails to take suitable action.

This leads to the unofficial definition of a boat’s danger zone—a concept not explicitly stated in the Navigation Rules, but one very valuable for safety. This is the arc from dead ahead to 22.5° abaft the starboard beam; see illustration in sidebar “The Danger Zone.” If you see another vessel within this danger zone, it most likely is the stand-on (privileged) vessel; yours is the give-way (burdened) vessel, and you must change course or speed to avoid collision.

Exceptions On all waters, a vessel must not cross a narrow channel or fairway in such a way as to impede the progress of a vessel that can only navigate safely within that channel or fairway. The vessel in the channel shall use the danger signal if it is in doubt as to the intention of the crossing vessel. [9(d)]

Further, on the Great Lakes, the Western Rivers, and any other waters specified by the Secretary, a vessel crossing a river must keep clear of a power-driven vessel proceeding up or down that river. [15(b)] This situation is analogous to a road intersection on land, where the side street has a “Stop” sign to prevent interference with traffic on the main street.

Signals The Inland Rules require whistle signals in both meeting and crossing situations. If the vessels are in sight of each other and will pass within a distance of a half-mile [34(a)], one, two, or three short blasts are used with the same meanings as described above for meeting situations. Again, the Rules do not state which vessel should signal first, but by custom it is most often the vessel that is privileged or believes itself to be privileged. A one- or two-short-blast signal is answered with the same number of blasts if the other vessel is in agreement and will take the steps necessary to effect a safe passing. The danger signal of five or more short, rapid blasts is used in the same way to indicate doubt in the safety of the actions taken or in the signaled intentions of the other vessel.

A maneuvering light may show one, two, three, or five or more flashes synchronized with the whistle blasts.

Note that this rule applies only if there is risk of collision. If two power-driven vessels will cross free and clear of each other, neither is the stand-on or give-way vessel, and thus whistle signals are inappropriate. In case of doubt, however, the safe procedure is to assume that the intentions of each are not known to the other.

##### THE DANGER ZONE

A power-driven vessel of any size has a so-called “danger zone” from dead ahead to 22.5° abaft its starboard beam (see right). It must give way to any crossing vessel that approaches within this zone. The danger zone is a concept that is implicit—although not specifically mentioned—in the Navigation Rules.

Note that the danger zone of the give-way vessel has the same arc of visibility as its green sidelight. Thus the stand-on vessel sees a “go” light from the other vessel. Conversely, the give-way vessel sees the red (“stop”) light of the stand-on vessel—a very logical situation!

Most often, altering course to starboard is the best action for the give-way vessel to keep clear; this allows that vessel to pass safely astern of the other. Slowing down or stopping are other options. The give-way vessel should not turn to port for a vessel forward of its beam.

The danger zone is not, however, applicable in all crossing situations. On the Great Lakes, the Western Rivers, and other specified waters, a power-driven vessel going upriver or down does not have to yield to a vessel in its danger zone if that other vessel is crossing the river. [15(b)]

A somewhat similar exception applies in all waters to small vessels crossing a narrow channel or fairway. [9(b)]

The “danger zone” is a concept implicit in the Navigation Rules and should be firmly understood by every boater.

#### Overtaking Situation

A power-driven or sail vessel is considered to be overtaking when it is coming up on another from a direction of more than 22.5° abaft either beam of the other vessel, and making greater speed so as to close the distance between them; see Figure 5-11. At night, this situation exists when the vessel astern cannot see either of the sidelights of the vessel ahead. By day, the overtaking vessel cannot always know with certainty whether it is forward or abaft a direction 22.5° abaft the other vessel’s beam; if in doubt, it should assume that it is an overtaking vessel. [13(b) and (c)]

Figure 5-11 Any vessel approaching another from more than 22.5° abaft the other’s beam, either side, is overtaking. As such it must keep out of the way of the vessel being overtaken. This rule applies even to a sailboat overtaking a motorboat. The overtaking boat remains in the give-way status for the remainder of the encounter and must keep clear until fully past, even though this takes it through the other vessel’s danger zone.

Notwithstanding any other provision in the Navigation Rules, every vessel overtaking another must keep out of the way of the overtaken vessel. The overtaking vessel is give-way; the overtaken vessel is stand-on. [13(a)]

The Rules state specifically that once a vessel is in an overtaking status, it remains so for the remainder of the encounter; no subsequent alteration of the bearing between the two vessels will serve to make the overtaking vessel a crossing vessel within the meaning of the Rules, or relieve it of its duty to keep clear of the overtaken vessel until it is finally past and clear. In other words, should the overtaking vessel come up on the starboard side of the overtaken vessel and move into its danger zone, the overtaking vessel does not by this movement become the stand-on vessel with the right-of-way. [13(d)]

Signals If the overtaking vessel desires to pass on the port side of the vessel ahead—as would be normal if the slower vessel were keeping to the right side of a channel (see Figure 5-12, left)—it must sound a two-short-blast signal. If the stand-on vessel agrees with such a passing, it should immediately sound the same signal. The faster vessel then directs its course to port and passes as proposed and agreed.

Figure 5-12 The overtaking boat (give-way, colored dark blue) signals first: two blasts for “I intend to overtake you on your port side” (the normal method); one blast for “I intend to overtake you on your starboard side” (legal but less desirable). Note that the wording differs from that used with the meeting and crossing signals, found on this page and this page [34(c)(i)]. If the signaled action is safe, the overtaken boat replies with the same signal. If it is not safe, that boat sounds the danger signal, five or more short blasts.

Should the vessel astern desire to pass on the other’s starboard side—not customary or preferred, but legally permissible (see Figure 5-12, center)—it must sound a one-short-blast signal, which is returned in kind by the stand-on vessel if it consents. [34(c) and 9(e)]

If in either of the above situations the vessel ahead does not consider that the proposed passing can take place safely, it must immediately sound the danger signal of five or more short, rapid blasts. (The danger signal should also be sounded if the overtaking boat attempts an unsafe passing without first giving a whistle signal of its intentions.)

An overtaking vessel receiving a danger signal in reply to its stated intention to pass should immediately cease all actions related to passing, and reduce speed so as to close no further on the overtaken vessel; see Figure 5-12, right. No attempt should be made to pass until the proper signals have been given and answered. Although not provided for in the Rules, it is reasonable for a stand-on vessel to give the danger signal, pause, and then give the other passing signal to the give-way vessel—saying in effect, “The side that you proposed is unsafe, but the other is OK.” This action by the stand-on vessel is not prescribed, but it is often logical because the leading vessel has a better view of the conditions ahead.

As in the meeting situation, cross signals—answering one blast with two or two blasts with one—make for an unsafe situation. Answer a signal only with the signal received or with the danger signal.

Even though the slower vessel ahead is privileged, it must never attempt to cross the bow or crowd the course of the passing vessel.

Although the overtaken (stand-on) vessel is required by Rule 17(a)(i) to keep its course and speed, it is often desirable in narrow channels or confined waterways for a boat to slow down so that the passing craft can likewise slow and thus pass with less wake. This action is a departure from the basic Rules, but it is covered by the language in Rule 9(e)(i) that the overtaken vessel may “take steps to permit safe passing.” It is also covered by Rule 2(b).

#### Use of Radio Communications

The Inland Rules state that vessels that have reached agreement in a meeting, crossing, or overtaking situation by using radio (Channel 13 in most areas, but 67 on the lower Mississippi River) need not sound whistle signals, but may do so. If agreement is not reached, then whistle signals must be exchanged “in a timely manner,” and these will govern the actions taken. [34(h)] The use of radio is highly desirable as it permits the exchange of so much more information than can be communicated by simple whistle blasts; it should be the preferred means of signaling in all passing situations.

Whether by whistle or by radio, signals should always be exchanged. In the event of a collision, a failure to do so may be taken into account in the determination of liability.

#### Narrow Channels

A vessel in a narrow channel must keep to the right and as close to the outer limit of the channel as is safe and practicable. [9(a)(i)] This places a burden on a vessel on the left side to (1) be there only if it must, and (2) establish agreement for a starboard-to-starboard passage.

Exception On the Great Lakes, the Western Rivers, and any other waters specified by the Secretary, a power-driven vessel operating in a narrow channel or fairway and proceeding downbound with a following current has the right-of-way over an upbound vessel and shall initiate maneuvering signals as appropriate. The vessel proceeding upbound against the current must hold as necessary to permit safe passing. This is one of only two Rules that contain the phrase “right-of-way.” [9(a)(ii)] This does not apply in tidal waters where there might be doubt as to the direction of the current, but by common courtesy a vessel proceeding against the current yields to the other.

#### Rounding Bends in a Channel

A special sound signal is provided for a situation in which a vessel approaches a bend or channel area where other vessels may be unseen because of an obstruction such as the banks, vegetation, or structures. In this situation the vessel sounds the “blind bend signal” of one prolonged blast. This signal must be answered with one prolonged blast by any approaching vessel within hearing. [34(e)] If such an answer is received, normal whistle signals must be exchanged when the vessels come within sight of one another; see Figure 5-13. If no reply to its signal is heard, the vessel may consider the channel ahead to be clear. All vessels in such situations must be navigated “with particular alertness and caution.” [9(f)]

Figure 5-13 When a vessel is approaching a bend in a river where vessels coming from the other direction cannot be seen, it should sound a special “blind bend signal” of one prolonged (4 to 6 seconds) blast. A second vessel approaching from the other direction answers with the same signal, and both vessels proceed with due caution, exchanging normal signals when within sight of each other.

In each such situation, a vessel with limited maneuverability or one requiring most of the channel width will often make a “security call” on VHF Channel 13 or 16, or both, to announce its position and direction of travel. Such calls should be answered by any vessels approaching the area.

#### Leaving a Berth

A power-driven vessel leaving a dock or berth must sound a warning signal of one prolonged blast. [34(g)] The same signal should be given by a boat exiting a side canal into a river or waterway.

Note that although it is not explicitly so stated in the Navigation Rules, it may be inferred that a boat just emerging from a slip or berth does not have the right-of-way over another vessel passing in the channel or nearby open water, even though it is in the other’s danger zone—its stand-on status in a crossing situation is not established until it is “fully in sight.”

#### Don’t Impede Other Vessels

A vessel less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length, or a sailing vessel, must not impede the passage of a vessel that can navigate safely only within a narrow channel or fairway. [9(b)]

A vessel engaged in fishing must not impede the passage of any other vessel navigating within a narrow channel or fairway. [9(c)]

A vessel must not cross a narrow channel or fairway in such a manner as to impede the progress of a vessel that must stay within that channel or fairway. The latter vessel must use the danger signal if there is doubt about the intentions of the crossing vessel. [9(d)]

If the circumstances allow, a vessel must not anchor in a narrow channel. [9(g)]

#### Ferry Boats

Although there are no express provisions in the Inland Rules that give special privileges to ferry boats, the courts have repeatedly ruled that ferries are entitled to a reasonable degree of freedom of entrance to and exit from their slips.

Boats should avoid passing unnecessarily close to piers, wharves, etc., where they may be caught unawares by movements of other vessels.

### Rules for Sailing Vessels Underway

The provisions of Inland Rule 12, which are stated below, apply only to situations involving two sailing vessels; neither may be under power, or a combination of sail and power.

When two sailing vessels are approaching one another so as to involve risk of collision, one of them must keep out of the way of the other in accordance with the following conditions:

• When each has the wind on a different side, the vessel with the wind on its port side must keep out of the way of the other; see Figure 5-14. [12(a)(i)]

Figure 5-14 Sailboats meeting may be on opposite tacks—one with the wind to starboard, the other with the wind to port. The boat with the wind to starboard is on a starboard tack and is the stand-on vessel, having right-of-way. The boat (colored dark blue) with the wind to port is the give-way vessel. If in doubt, a skipper should assume that his boat does not have the right-of-way.

• When both have the wind on the same side, the vessel to windward must keep out of the way of the vessel that is to leeward; see Figure 5-15. [12(a)(ii)]

Figure 5-15 When two sailboats meet on the same tack (both with the wind on the same side), one will be to windward of the other—in the direction from which the wind is blowing. This is the windward boat (give-way, colored dark blue), which must keep clear of the leeward boat (stand-on). A leeward boat might have its wind blocked and be hampered in its ability to maneuver.

• If a vessel with the wind on its port side sees a vessel to windward and cannot determine with certainty whether the other vessel has the wind on its port or starboard side, it must keep out of the way of that vessel. [12(a)(iii)]

For the purpose of Rule 12, the windward side is the side opposite that on which the mainsail is carried (or in the case of a square-rigged vessel, the side opposite that on which the largest fore-and-aft sail is carried). [12(b)]

Signals Sound signals are not required in passing situations between two sailing vessels. Note, however, that sailing vessels are required to sound all reduced visibility (“fog”) signals, whether on a whistle, horn, or bell.[35(c)]

### Encounters Between Sailing & Power Vessels

In general, a sailing vessel has the right-of-way over a vessel propelled by machinery or by both sail and machinery. The power-driven vessel must keep out of the way of the sailing vessel; see Figure 5-16. [18(a)(iv)] Passing signals are not required but are not prohibited; if a powerboat signals a sailboat, it should not expect a reply.

Figure 5-16 In an encounter between a sailboat and one driven by power, the powerboat (give-way, colored dark blue above) must keep out of the way of the sailing craft. However, if the sailboat is overtaking a powerboat—an unlikely but possible situation—the sailboat is the give-way vessel.

There are, however, some exceptions, and they should be thoroughly understood. Should a sailing vessel overtake a power-driven vessel, the overtaking situation rule prevails, and the sailing vessel is the give-way one, regardless of the means of propulsion. [13]

Likewise, a sailing vessel is not the stand-on vessel in an encounter with certain vessels engaged in fishing (but this does not include trolling), a vessel not under command, or a vessel restricted in its ability to maneuver; see Figure 5-17. [18(b)]

Figure 5-17 A sailboat must keep clear of fishing vessels, vessels restricted in ability to maneuver, and vessels that cannot navigate safely outside the channel. The sailboat above is the give-way vessel.

### Vessel Traffic Service

A Vessel Traffic Service (VTS) is established by U.S. Coast Guard regulations to provide mariners with information relating to the safe navigation of a congested waterway or area of special hazards. Normally advisory only, under certain circumstances a VTS may issue directions to control the movement of vessels in order to minimize the risk of collisions or damage to property or the environment. The master or person directing the movement of the vessel remains at all times responsible for compliance with the applicable Navigation Rules.

A VTS consists of a system of regulations, communications, and monitoring facilities established at selected ports and confined waterways to provide active position monitoring, collision avoidance services, and navigational advice. For each VTS area, a set of reporting-in points and precautionary areas are established. In most locations, vessels report their position, speed, and other information to a vessel traffic center (VTC) on a designated VHF radio channel. The VTC monitors conditions in the area with one or more remote radar sites, and in some cases, remote TV cameras. Some VTS are voluntary, but most are compulsory for specified classes of vessels when navigating: all power-driven vessels over 40 meters (131 ft), all towing vessels over 8 meters (26 ft), and all vessels certificated for 50 or more passengers when engaged in trade. In some ports, vessels at anchor are required to monitor a separate designated channel.

A recreational boat is not normally subject to VTS regulations but should be aware of VTS locations and their restrictions on the movements of large vessels. It may monitor the VTS radio channel but should not transmit. Geographic boundaries and VHF radio frequency designations for VTS areas are noted at www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=vtsMain and in the “Special Notice to Mariners Paragraphs” section in the first Notice to Mariners of each year.

Automatic Vessel Identification An automatic identification system (AIS), where established and for ships so equipped, provides for the continuous transmission of a vessel’s movement to a VTC and to other ships with equipment to receive and display such information. A Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver (see this page) supplies position, course, and speed data to a radio that then transmits it along with other information such as type of vessel, call sign, etc., digitally on a designated VHF channel. The system is capable of handling more than 2,000 messages per minute, with updates as often as every two seconds. AIS is operational on all SOLAS vessels and may be used on recreational vessels (see this page).

### Conduct in Restricted Visibility

Fog is one cause of restricted visibility, but not the only one. Others include heavy rain or snow, sandstorms, and even dense smoke from on shore. Rule 19 applies to vessels that are not in sight of each other yet are navigating in or near areas of restricted visibility. They must proceed at a “safe speed adapted to the prevailing circumstances and conditions.” [19(b)] The Rules make no reference to a specific speed that would be considered “safe.” This is left for the skipper of each vessel to decide, but the obvious intent of Rule 6, “Safe Speed,” is that vessels should slow down. There is no mention of the old adage of “being able to stop in half the distance of visibility,” but that does make good sense. If both vessels followed this procedure, they would not collide. The use of radar is not a justification for failing to operate at a safe speed, nor is it an excuse for not posting appropriate lookouts. Each skipper must consider Rule 6 carefully to determine the application of all factors to the particular situation at hand.

Vessels must also have due regard for the steering and sailing rules that prevail under all conditions of visibility. [19(c)]

##### TAKING ALL WAY OFF

The following excerpt is taken from Cockroft & Lameijer’s A Guide to the Collision Avoidance Rules:

The courts have held that a vessel operating without radar in restricted visibility should reverse engines to take all way off in the following instances:

• A fog signal is heard for the first time in close proximity.

• A fog signal is heard dead ahead.

• A fog signal appears to be a narrowing beam that is moving toward the bow.

• Another vessel is seen looming out of the fog, but its course cannot be determined.

• A sailboat’s fog signal is heard from forward of the beam.

• A fog signal is heard from a vessel at anchor and the tide is setting toward it.

There are many other situations in which taking all way off is indicated. When this is done, however, it should be kept in mind that the sound of the engines reversing may block out further fog signals from other vessels.

#### Close-Quarters Situations

When the fog signal of another vessel appears to come from forward of your beam, you are required to reduce speed to bare steerageway. If necessary, the boat hearing the signal must take all way off (stop dead) and “in any event, navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over.” The same requirement to slow down or stop applies to any boat that knows it is in close quarters with another vessel, even if it has not heard a fog signal. [19(e)]

How “close” is close-quarters? The Rules make no statement on this question. On the high seas, this distance is generally regarded as about 2 nautical miles, or the audible range of the typical ship’s fog signal.

It is important to note that it can be very difficult to tell where a sound signal is coming from in fog, and it is easy to be fooled. Additional lookouts should be posted and instructed to both look and listen. Never alter course until the position of the other vessel is known with reasonable certainty. If radar is available, it must be used.

#### Engine Availability

Whenever visibility is restricted, a power-driven vessel must have its engines ready for immediate maneuver. [19(b)] The same advice makes good sense for sailboats with auxiliary power but is not required by the Rules.

##### IF COLLISION IS UNAVOIDABLE

It’s not a happy thought, but the rule of thumb is this:

• Stop as quickly as possible and face the danger. If there’s any doubt on which side a vessel approaching directly and at a relatively high speed may attempt to pass, present as small a target as possible. The effects of a collision will be much less if the impact is taken end-on rather than broadside.

#### Using Radar Information

Vessels that have radar on board must use it properly, including plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects to obtain early warning of a risk of collision, but most especially in restricted visibility. [7(b)] If a close-quarters situation with another vessel is detected by radar alone, the vessel using radar must take action to avoid the risk of collision in ample time—but certain types of actions must be avoided.

• An alteration of course to port for a vessel forward of the beam, other than a vessel being overtaken. [19(d)(i)]

• An alteration of course toward a vessel abeam or abaft the beam. [19(d)(ii)]

Any action to avoid risk of collision in restricted visibility should be monitored to ensure that a new risk does not develop. Lookouts must be posted and the radar observed continuously with plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects. [7(b)]

### Sound Signals in Restricted Visibility

Rule 35 prescribes sound signals to be given by different types of vessels in various conditions when in or near an area of restricted visibility. These are often termed “fog signals,” but they apply equally in any of the conditions included in the definition of restricted visibility (see this page). They also apply equally day or night. The same equipment is used for these whistle signals as for maneuvering and warning signals.

Courts have held that fog signals should be sounded when visibility is reduced to the distance at which sidelights are required. These sound signals serve two purposes: they alert nearby vessels to the presence and approximate position of the signaling vessel, and they may indicate its status (underway or not) or limitations of maneuverability (towing, being towed, sailing, fishing, etc.).

#### Power-Driven Vessels Underway

A power-driven vessel making way through the water must sound one prolonged blast at intervals of not more than two minutes. [35(a)]

Such a vessel underway but stopped and making no way through the water (also described as “underway with no way on”) must sound, at the same intervals, a signal of two prolonged blasts in succession separated by an interval of about two seconds. {35(b)]

A vessel towing or pushing another ahead, a vessel not under command, a vessel restricted in its ability to maneuver (underway or at anchor), and a fishing vessel (underway or anchored) all sound the same signal—one prolonged blast followed by two short blasts at intervals of not more than two minutes. [35(c)]

#### Sailing Vessels Underway

A sailing vessel underway makes the same sound signal in restricted visibility conditions as does a towing vessel, fishing vessel, etc., just as described above—one prolonged blast followed by two short blasts at intervals of not more than two minutes. [35(c)] Note that a sailing vessel, while not required to have a whistle for passing signals, must have some means of signaling in reduced visibility.

##### NOT TOO OFTEN!

The Rules prescribe an interval of “not more than two minutes” between the soundings of most fog signals from a vessel, and two minutes is the interval normally used. This is long enough for lookouts to recover their hearing after their own vessel sounds its fog signal, yet not so long as to allow other vessels to approach too closely without warning. Timing is best done automatically, and many electronic hailers have the capability to generate a fog signal regularly through their external sound system. If no automatic device is available, the sweep-second hand of a watch or clock may be used. The silent periods between blasts are intended for listening for signals from other vessels. (Note that the interval is one minute for bell and gong signals.)

Two minutes is a relatively brief interval and normally should not be further reduced by skippers concerned about collision. Use the interval between your blasts to listen for other vessels’ signals; this is as valuable for safety as blowing your own whistle or horn. If your signals are sounded automatically, interrupt them from time to time to make sure you are not signaling in synchronization with another vessel.

#### Vessels at Anchor

A vessel at anchor must, at intervals of not more than one minute, ring its bell rapidly for about five seconds. If it is 100 meters (328.1 ft) or more in length, the bell must be sounded in the forepart of the vessel, and immediately thereafter a gong must be sounded rapidly in the after part of the vessel for about five seconds. [35(g)]

A vessel at anchor may additionally sound a three-blast whistle signal—one short, one prolonged, one short—to give warning of its position, and the possibility of collision. [35(g)

Special Anchorage Areas Inland Rule 35(l) permits the omission of fog signals for vessels in a “special anchorage area” (see this page) if they are less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length or if they are a barge, canal boat, scow, or “other nondescript craft.”

#### Vessels Aground

A vessel aground must sound the bell signal of a vessel at anchor (and the gong signal, if applicable) and additionally give three separate and distinct strokes on the bell immediately before and after the rapid ringing of the bell. [35(h)] It does not sound the whistle signal of an anchored vessel.

A vessel aground may also sound an appropriate whistle signal on detecting the approach of another vessel if there is the possibility of collision. [35(h)] This rule is not specific as to the number and length of the blasts, but it could be the letter “U” of the International Code (short-short-long) for “You are standing into danger.”

#### Vessels Being Towed

If manned, a vessel being towed (or the last vessel if several are being towed in a string) must sound a fog signal of four blasts—one prolonged and three short blasts—at intervals of not more than two minutes. When possible, this signal should be sounded immediately after the signal of the towing vessel; see Figure 5-18. [35(e)] Unmanned towed vessels are not required to sound a fog signal.

Figure 5-18 A vessel towed astern (or the last vessel if more than one is being towed), if manned should sound a fog signal of one prolonged blast followed by three short blasts at intervals of not more than two minutes. If practicable, this signal should be sounded immediately after the fog signal—one prolonged followed by two short blasts—of the towing vessel.

#### Pilot Vessels

A pilot vessel, when engaged on pilot duties in restricted visibility conditions, may sound an “identity signal” of four short blasts. This would be in addition to the normal signals of a vessel underway, underway with no way on, or at anchor. [35(k)]

#### Exception for Small Craft

Vessels 12 meters (39.4 ft) or more but less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) in length, when at anchor or aground, and vessels under 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length in all conditions of restricted visibility, may, but need not, sound the above bell signals. If they do not, they must make “some other efficient sound signal” at intervals not exceeding two minutes. [35(i) and (j)]

### Other Rules & Procedures

There are a number of other, somewhat unrelated, rules and procedures with which a skipper should be familiar.

#### Signals to Attract Attention

To attract the attention of another vessel, any vessel may make light and/or sound signals that cannot be mistaken for any signal authorized in the Rules, or may direct the beam of its searchlight in the direction of the danger in such a way as to not embarrass any vessel. [36] The practical meaning of this prohibition is that you should not shine your searchlight directly into the pilot house or flybridge of another boat.

Use of high-intensity flashing (“strobe”) lights for the purpose of attracting attention is illegal. They are an official distress signal.

#### Signals for Drawbridges & Locks

U.S. Coast Guard regulations—not a part of the Inland Rules or Pilot Rules—prescribe uniform and unmistakable whistle signals for drawbridge operation. A vessel requesting a drawbridge opening will sound one prolonged whistle blast followed within three seconds by one short blast; this signal has no other meaning in any set of Navigation Rules. The regulations also provide for making the opening signal by horn, bell, or shout, or by any similar device whose sound can be clearly heard. The vessel’s signal should be repeated until acknowledged by the draw tender (also called a bridge tender) before proceeding close to the bridge.

Intent to Open the Draw If the drawtender will open the draw immediately, he responds with a similar one-prolonged-one-short-blast signal. If the draw cannot be opened immediately, the drawtender will sound five short blasts. When this signal has been sounded from the bridge, a vessel is specifically prohibited from attempting to pass through the closed draw.

Immediate Closing When an open drawbridge must be closed immediately, the drawtender must first sound the five-short-blast signal. This signal must be acknowledged by the vessel by sounding the same five-short-blast signal; if the vessel does not acknowledge the drawtender’s signal, the drawtender must repeat it until that is done. The same five-short-blast signal is sounded before a routine closing of a bridge; it is not replied to by a vessel unless it is still in the draw and would be endangered by the bridge being closed, in which case, the boat sounds five blasts. Other vessels must not enter the draw after the bridge tender has sounded the five-blast signal.

Approaching an Open Draw A vessel approaching a bridge that is already open still must give the opening signal. If no acknowledgement is received within 30 seconds, the vessel may proceed, with caution, through the draw.

Use of Visual Signals Visual signals may also be used if weather conditions may prevent signals from being heard or if sound-producing devices are not functioning properly. (Sound signals may also be used with visual signals.) A vessel signals with a white flag of a size readily visible for a half-mile by day or with a white, amber, or green light bright enough to be seen at the same distance at night. This signal is raised and lowered vertically, in full sight of the bridge tender, until acknowledged. The tender signals that the bridge will open immediately by repeating the same signal. The signal from the bridge that it cannot be opened immediately, or if open must be closed immediately, is a red flag waved horizontally by day or a red light swung back and forth horizontally at night in full sight of the vessel. (Some bridges may have mechanical devices and/or fixed/flashing electrical lights to signify the same meanings.)

Use of Radio Communications By far the most common form of communication in recent years between a vessel and a bridge tender is via VHF radio. Indeed, radio communications are used first to request an opening and also to receive information about the bridge’s opening status and any actions to be taken. Bridges equipped with radios often will display a sign in which a lightning-bolt symbol is superimposed on a telephone handset graphic; the preferred calling channel will be stated in the lower left corner of the sign, while the preferred working channel will be on the lower right. The bridge may also display a sign simply saying which channel to call to request an opening. Once contact is established, both the vessel and the bridge tender must continue to monitor the selected channel – most often 13 but occasionally 9 or even 16 – until the vessel has cleared the draw and the bridge area. If, for some reason, VHF radio contact cannot be established or maintained, sound or visual signals must be used.

Two or More Drawbridges Coast Guard regulations require that a vessel wishing to pass through two or more bridges close together must give the opening signal for the first bridge, and after acknowledgement it must give the opening signal for the second bridge, and so on, until all bridges have acknowledged that they will be opening promptly.

Two or More Vessels If two or more vessels approach the same drawbridge at nearly the same time from the same or opposite directions, the regulations require that each vessel must signal independently for the opening of the draw. The drawtender need not reply to signals by vessels accumulated at the bridge for passage during a scheduled open period.

Restricted Operations Some bridges have restricted hours of operations because of the volume of land traffic. The Coast Guard may authorize periods of no openings or openings only on specific schedules, such as hourly or every 30, 20, or 15 minutes. The restrictions may be for all day or only for morning and evening rush hours; there may also be seasonal restrictions. The restrictions will be posted on signs on each side of the bridge. During such periods, certain privileged vessels—government craft, tugs with tows, etc.—can request an opening by sounding five short blasts in lieu of the normal signal.

Do Not Cause Unnecessary Openings Clearance gauges are maintained on most drawbridges; skippers should know the vertical clearance required for their craft. Coast Guard regulations provide increasingly severe fines for vessel owners and operators who cause unnecessary bridge openings because of any nonstructural vessel appurtenance which is not essential to navigation or which is easily lowered. On the other hand, the same regulations provide penalties for any bridge tender who unreasonably delays the openings of a draw after the required signals have been given.

Canal Locks Signals for the operation of canal locks are often the same as those for bridges nearby, but not always; radios can be very effective in obtaining information on the status of a lock. Major ship canals have elaborate sets of lights and/or horn signals to control waterborne traffic. Consult the appropriate volume of the Coast Pilot or Navigation Regulations for the proper signals and VHF radio channel to use before approaching any lock.

### Pilot Rules for Inland Waters

As noted in Chapter 4, the Pilot Rules are in Annex V to the Inland Navigation Rules.

### Penalties

The penalties for violation of the Navigation Rules are described in Chapter 4; see this page and this page.

## INTERNATIONAL NAVIGATION RULES

Certain of the International Rules relate to navigational lights and shapes; these were discussed in Chapter 4. This chapter considers only those rules and annexes relating to right-of-way, conduct of vessels in restricted visibility, and sound signals.

#### Manner of Consideration

Study of the U.S. Inland Rules provides an excellent base for learning the International Navigation Rules. Hence, the International Rules are considered in detail here only where they differ from the U.S. Inland Rules. Topics are discussed in the same sequence.

### Definitions

The International Rules contain one definition that is not used in the U.S. Inland Rules. A vessel constrained by its draft is a power-driven vessel that, because of its draft in relation to the available depth and width of navigable water, is severely restricted in its ability to deviate from its course. [3(h)]

### Steering & Sailing Rules

The rules for signals are very nearly identical in the two sets, but where they do differ, the difference can be considerable and significant.

#### Sound and Light Signals

The one- and two-short-blast whistle signals in the Inland Rules under conditions of good visibility are signals of intent and agreement, whereas those of the International Rules are indications of taking action to alter course. The International Rules signals are often termed rudder signals; they do not require a reply; see Figure 5-19. In some instances the other vessel will take similar action and so sound the same signal. The three- and five-or-more short blast signals have the same meaning in both sets of Rules.

Figure 5-19 Whistle signals of the International Navigation Rules indicate course changes rather than intent to pass. Such signals are not returned by the other vessel.

#### Equipment for Sound Signals

Annex III of the International Rules differs from the corresponding U.S. Inland Rules annex, but the differences are essentially technical and of little concern to small craft skippers. Several changes were made to this International Rules annex in November 2003 relating to frequencies, intensities, and ranges of audibility for vessels of various sizes.

The International Rules do not contain the provision allowing a vessel normally used for towing alongside or pushing ahead to use a whistle matched to the length of the customary combination of towed and towing vessels (see this page).

Sound-signaling equipment that is acceptable to the International Rules can also be used on inland waters, as provided for in the Inland Rule 1(b)(ii).

#### Maneuvering Lights

A maneuvering light used in conjunction with whistle signals must be white; yellow is not acceptable as it is under the Inland Rules. The light must have minimum range of 5 miles, and it need not be synchronized with the vessel’s whistle but must flash once for each blast sounded. Each flash and the interval between flashes shall be of about one second duration, and the interval between successive signals must be at least 10 seconds. [34(b)]

### Rules for Power-Driven Vessels

The rules for meeting and crossing situations are the same in both sets, except for whistle signals. The International Rules do not have the one-half-mile closest-point-of-approach requirement for signaling intent to pass, nor the reply signals of agreement. They do require a whistle signal for each change of course, without reply signals from the other vessel. On winding rivers where the vessel’s course follows the waterway, however, no whistle signals are used for the many necessary changes of course.

#### Overtaking Vessels

International Rule 9(e) for vessels in an overtaking situation applies only in a narrow channel or fairway and only if the overtaken vessel has to take some action to permit safe passing [9(e)(i)] (not in all waters and in all overtaking situations, as in the Inland Rules). The whistle signals are very different, and quite complex. [34(c)]

A vessel overtaking another will signal its intention by two prolonged blasts, followed by one short blast (“I intend to overtake you on your starboard side”) or by two prolonged blasts followed by two short blasts (“I intend to overtake you on your port side”). The vessel about to be overtaken signals its agreement not with the identical signal, as Inland Rules specify, but with one prolonged, one short, one prolonged, and one short blast—this is the letter “C” in Morse code and the international signal for “yes.” In case of doubt, the vessel about to be overtaken will sound the five-or-more short and rapid blasts.

#### Use of Radio Communication

The International Rules do not contain provisions for the use of radiotelephone communications in lieu of whistle signals. This does not mean, however, that such additional procedures are not an excellent means of ensuring a safe passage, and they are normally used.

#### Narrow Channels

International Rule 9(d) differs from its Inland Rules counterpart in that the sounding of a danger signal by a vessel that observes another crossing a narrow channel or fairway is optional, rather than mandatory.

##### THE DUTY TO KEEP A LOOKOUT

Both the Inland and the International Navigation Rules are quite specific about requiring a “proper lookout.” This requirement has been further amplified by U.S. court decisions arising out of collisions. One of the earliest rulings dates from 1833, when a sailing vessel was held liable for a collision with another sailing vessel. The first vessel had no watch on deck other than the man at the helm. Later court decisions extended the ruling to power-driven vessels.

The courts have repeatedly defined a “lookout” as a person who is specially charged with the duty of observing lights, sounds, echoes, and any obstruction to navigation with all of the thoroughness that the circumstances permit. “Specially charged” in this context means that the lookout has no other duties at that time that might in any way detract from the keeping of a proper watch. Except in limited circumstances, mostly involving smaller vessels, the operator of a vessel is not legally complying with the Rules by keeping a lookout from the pilothouse.

A lookout should be someone who has had the training and experience to do the job. Normally the lookout should be stationed outside any cabin in order to hear sound signals. In fog, the traditional wisdom is to place the lookout as far forward and as low down as possible.

###### RADAR-EQUIPPED VESSELS

The Rules require the proper use of radar on vessels that are so equipped. The person using the radar must know the characteristics, efficiency, and limitations of the equipment. Targets detected by radar must be systematically observed and plotted to determine their actual courses and speeds. Rule 7 is absolutely clear—assumptions should never be made from scanty radar information.

The sea state, weather (such as rain), and even transmissions from other nearby radars can cause targets to disappear from radar screens for periods of time. Small boats, particularly fiberglass-constructed recreational craft, may not always be detected in time to avoid collision. Use of a single range scale can be misleading. On long-range settings, small targets at short range may not be detected. At a short-range setting, the approach of a large vessel at some distance may not be detected.

#### Leaving a Berth

The International Rules do not include a signal for a power-driven vessel leaving a berth, as does Inland Rule 34(g). Such a signal, however, is not prohibited and would be a good idea, even on those U.S. coastal waters subject to the International Rules.

#### Sound Signals in Restricted Visibility

The International Rules do prescribe a sound signal in restricted visibility (such as fog) for a vessel constrained by its draft; this is the same signal, “one prolonged blast followed by two short blasts,” as has been prescribed for a sailing vessel, a towing vessel, a vessel engaged in fishing, and a vessel that is restricted in its ability to maneuver. [35(c)]

The International Rules do not provide for “special anchorage areas” where fog signals need not be sounded by small boats or by barges, scows, and the like.

### General Right-of-Way Provisions

The International Rules contain the same general right-of-way “ranking” of vessel types as the Inland Rules do (see this page), plus a provision that any vessel except one not under command or restricted in its ability to maneuver must avoid impeding the safe passage of a vessel constrained by its draft, a category not included in the Inland Rules. [18(d)]

##### TRAFFIC SEPARATION SCHEMES

A Traffic Separation Scheme (TSS) is one of several routing measures adopted by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to improve the safety of navigation in areas of converging traffic, congested areas, or where the freedom of navigation is constrained in some way. These are usually found at the entrances to major ports and “choke points,” where heavy volumes of shipping are forced to pass through narrow straits. TSSs are usually in waters outside demarcation lines, but their use is covered by Rule 10 in both the International and Inland Rules.

A TSS separates opposing traffic streams by appropriate means—such as the establishment of traffic lanes. Each traffic lane is reserved for one-way traffic of large ships with the direction indicated by an arrow on the chart. For small craft skippers, the regulation of particular interest is the one stating that vessels less than 20 meters (65.6 ft) and sailing vessels must not impede the safe passage of a power-driven vessel following a traffic lane. [10(j)]

A separation zone or line keeps apart the traffic lanes of vessels that are traveling in opposite directions. It also may divide traffic lanes from adjacent open waters, or it may designate separate lanes for particular classes of vessels heading in the same direction. There can be inshore traffic zones that comprise a defined area between the landward boundary of a TSS and the adjacent coast. Where lanes converge, there will be a precautionary zone.

Ships that are using a TSS proceed in the appropriate traffic lane. So far as practicable, they are obliged to keep clear of a traffic separation zone or line. Vessels not using a traffic separation scheme must avoid it by as wide a margin as possible.

Normally, ships enter or leave a traffic separation lane at the termination of that lane. If they must join or leave a lane from either side, they should do so at as small an angle to the general flow of traffic as possible.

Vessels are advised to avoid crossing traffic lanes. If this cannot be avoided, crossing should be done as nearly as practicable at right angles to the general direction of traffic flow. Other than when crossing, vessels should refrain from entering a separation zone, except in emergencies or to fish within the separation zone.

Vessels less than 20 meters (65.6 ft.) in length, sailing vessels, and fishing vessels are free to use an inshore traffic zone if one exists. Otherwise, inshore traffic zones are not normally used by through-traffic.

Traffic separation schemes are indicated on NOS charts. This example shows the approaches to New York Harbor.

U.S. Traffic Separation Schemes are also published in the “Special Notice to Mariners Paragraphs” section in the first Notice to Mariners of each year.

## DISTRESS SIGNALS

Because of their great importance, the accepted forms of distress signals have been written into both the International and U.S. Inland Rules of the Road. These are contained in Annex IV, which is identical in both sets of rules, except that the Inland Rules additionally list a white high-intensity “strobe” light flashing 50 to 70 times per minute.

Figure 5-20 lists the officially recognized signals, but in an emergency a skipper can and should use any means he can to summon help.

Figure 5-20 Distress signals are specified and described in both the International and Inland Navigation Rules. These are the ones that are officially recognized, but in an emergency, a skipper can and should use any available means to summon help.

### Supplemental Signals

In the category of “supplemental signals,” Annex IV lists a piece of orange-colored canvas with both a black square and a circle, or other appropriate symbol, for identification from the air. (Actually, the circle should be solid, more properly termed a “disk”; and although “other appropriate symbol” is not defined, the word “HELP” in large black, block letters is often used.)

#### Unofficial Distress Symbols

An unofficial but well-recognized signal, especially in inland and coastal waters, is a red-orange flag of any size, waved from side-to-side.

Most American boatmen would recognize the flying of an inverted U.S. national or yacht ensign as a signal of distress. Remember that such a signal has no official sanction, however, because many national flags have no “top” or “bottom” and appear the same if turned upside down.

Use of radiotelephones for distress communications and the new Digital Selective Calling (DSC) distress alert are covered in Chapter 20.

##### KNOW THE RULES—BUT USE GOOD JUDGMENT

When your boat encounters another in a situation involving a possible collision, you must know the Navigation Rules, take the proper actions, and, if appropriate, sound the prescribed sound signal. But that is not enough; you must be alert and use good judgment. The other skipper may or may not know the Rules, and he may not take the actions prescribed by the Rules. If the situation progresses to the point where an accident is likely, you must take any action necessary to avoid collision—this deviation from the normal procedures of the Rules is allowed, even required, by Rule 2.

# CHAPTER6

Figure 6-01 On open water, away from marked channels, one way a person at the helm can maintain the proper course is by keeping an eye on the compass. When possible, sight on a distant object that is ahead in the direction that you want to go—but do not use clouds or other boats.

SEAMANSHIP UNDER POWER

Helmsmanship • Propeller & Rudder Actions • Single-Screw Inboard Maneuvering • Maneuvering in Tight Quarters • Dock Lines & Their Uses • Twin-Screw Maneuvering • Maneuvering with Directed Thrust

Boat-handling ability is at the very heart of good seamanship. Some of the finest exhibitions of boat handling are given by boaters who have never read a printed page on the subject of seamanship. Their proficiency, developed over long years of meeting every conceivable situation, manifests itself almost as an instinct, prompting the skipper to react correctly whether he can think the problem out beforehand or not.

A recreational boater, particularly a novice, will not have these years of experience. He can gain much from a study of the basic factors involved, and then build up his experience. In approaching a study of the principles of boat handling, keep in mind that the goal is to understand why your boat reacts the way it does when you are out there handling it. If your craft stubbornly refuses to make a turn under certain conditions, or persists in backing one way when you want it to go the other, you are less likely to make the same mistake repeatedly once you understand the reasons behind its behavior.

## HELMSMANSHIP

The ability to steer well—called helmsmanship, whether involving men or women—is a quality that cannot be learned from a book or in a classroom. However, understanding the basic principles of boat handling will make it easier for you to perform in a variety of situations.

It is important to realize that boats are nearly as individualistic as people, particularly in their steering characteristics. Deep-draft and shallow-draft vessels handle differently. Boats that steer by changing their thrust direction (i.e., those powered by outboards, sterndrives, pod drives, or jet drives) or by using bow or stern thrusters respond differently from boats steered by rudders. The response of a heavy displacement hull to helm changes is quite unlike that of a light planing hull.

The secret of good helmsmanship is to know your boat. If you skipper your own craft, this comes quickly as you gain experience with it. If you take the wheel or tiller of a friend’s boat, however, take it easy with helm changes until you get a “feel” for the craft’s responses.

#### Steering by Compass

Boats are often piloted by running compass courses; see Figure 6-01. You must keep the compass lubber’s line on the mark of the card that indicates the course to be steered. If the course to be steered is 100° and the lubber’s line is momentarily at 95° you must “swing the boat’s head” with right rudder 5° to the right, to bring the lubber’s line around to 100°. Remember, the card stands still while the lubber’s line swings around it. You have to steer to port or starboard as necessary to move the lubber’s line toward the desired heading indication to get on course.

When a vessel swings with a change in course, an inexperienced helmsman tends to allow it to swing too far due to the momentum of the turn and the lag between a turn of the wheel and the response of the craft. The experienced helmsman knows how to steady on the new course without oversteering. In almost all power cruisers, this requires that the helmsman return the rudder to the neutral, midships position before the craft reaches the intended new heading. You will often need to use a slight amount of opposite rudder to check the boat’s swing.

A zigzag course brands the helmsman as inexperienced. The goal is a straight course; this can be achieved, after the boat has steadied, by only slight movements of the wheel. An experienced boater at the helm anticipates the vessel’s swing and, turning the wheel slowly and deliberately, makes corrections with little rudder instead of going well off course before correcting.

A good helmsman will also turn the wheel slowly and deliberately. The actual manner of steering is a characteristic of each craft, and is learned only by experience.

When holding a course, it helps to pick out a distant landmark or other fixed object, if there is one, to steer by. At night, a star can be used, but remember that the apparent positions of stars change over a period of hours. This helps to keep a straight course, as a boat compass is smaller and less steady than one aboard a large vessel. Avoid steering on cloud formations; these move with the wind and change shape. Drop your eyes periodically to the compass to check your course, and always remember to look back frequently at the aids or landmarks you have passed, making sure that you remain on your proper track. Even though you may be steering quite precisely toward your objective, the wind or a crosscurrent may be setting you to one side. If in a narrow channel, you could soon be out of it and aground.

If steering by an electronic device such as an autopilot (see this page) or following the waypoint-to-waypoint line or “highway screen” on an electronic chartplotter, always monitor the off-course error, called crosstrack error, calculated by your GPS or chartplotter.

## BASIC PRINCIPLES OF BOAT HANDLING

The proper approach to boat handling is a balance of study and practice. Learn all you can about the principles by which average boats respond under normal conditions; supplement this with experience in your own boat and others. In this way you will learn to act so that the controlling elements aid rather than oppose you.

In boat handling, there are three primary types of powered craft to consider: inboard single-screw, inboard twin-screw, and outboard (as well as sterndrive, pod drive, and jet drive), whether single or multiple. The first two use a rudder or rudders in combination with the accelerated waterflow from the propeller or propellers; the last uses directed water thrust, usually without a rudder. The handling characteristics of each type are different from the others, but as the single-screw, single-rudder inboard is the basic type, we will cover it in considerable detail. Note that the principles apply equally for a sailboat being moved through the water by inboard auxiliary power.

No two boats will behave in an identical manner in every situation. Just how a boat performs depends on many things, among them the shape of the hull’s underbody; the shape, position, and area of the rudder; the boat’s trim, speed, weight, and load; the strength and direction of wind and current; and the nature of the sea.

### Basic Boat-Handling Terms

Certain basic boating terms apply specifically to boats equipped with one or more engines—whether inboard (mounted within the hull), outboard (mounted on the transom and detachable), or the combination inboard-outboard (I/O) type, also called sterndrives. Thrust for the movement of the boat through the water is achieved by the rotation of a propeller (or “screw”), which draws in water from ahead and pushes it out astern. A boat with one propeller is termed a single-screw type. Boats with two propellers are referred to as twin-screw craft. Sailboats fitted with an engine are called auxiliaries; their handling characteristics are similar to those of a single-screw powerboat, although their engines are usually of lesser horsepower.

Steering is accomplished in one of two ways. An inboard engine operates according to a “fixed-screw”: Turning a rudder or rudders diverts the thrust developed by the propeller(s), which in turn turns the boat; see Figure 6-02. An outboard- or I/O-powered boat operates without a rudder. Pivoting the motor and propeller or the outdrive unit redirects the propeller thrust, changing the boat’s direction.

Figure 6-02 Left rudder on a boat going ahead (above, left) causes the stern to move to starboard and the bow to turn to port. Left rudder while going astern (above, right) moves the stern to port. The bow initially moves straight backward in this case, and then turns to starboard.

Just as a person has a left and right side, a boat has a left—or port—side and a right—or starboard—side as you stand on board and look forward. The left and right sides of a person stay the same no matter from which direction you look; similarly, turning around while on board and looking aft will not change the boat’s port and starboard sides.

A boat is said to be making headway when it is going forward in the water and sternway when it is backing up. A boat is turning to port when its bow is moving to the left when making headway. A boat is said to be going to port when making sternway if its stern is moving to the left.

The terms right rudder and left rudder refer to how the bow would turn if the boat were making headway. The terms are also used for the same position of the rudder when making sternway. A boat with left rudder applied will turn its bow to port while making headway and swing its stern to port when making sternway. In Figure 6-02, the boat has left rudder in both cases. Right rudder would be just the opposite.

A balanced rudder is one whose blade surface lies partly ahead of its rudderstock; refer to Figure 1-11. (An unbalanced rudder, seldom seen, is one whose blade surface is fully behind the rudderstock.) While the portion of this forward balance area may be only 20 percent of the total rudder area, it exerts considerable effect in taking strain off the steering gear and making the steering easier.

#### Right- & Left-Hand Propellers

Propellers are said to be right-hand or left-hand depending on the direction they turn (looking forward from aft of the propeller). The difference is important because propeller rotation has a considerable bearing on how a boat maneuvers, especially when reversing. A propeller that turns clockwise when driving the boat ahead is right-handed; one that turns counterclockwise is considered left-handed. To determine the “hand” with the boat out of the water, stand astern of the propeller and look forward at the driving face of the blades; the forward edge of each blade cuts through the water. If the propeller will turn clockwise when driving the boat forward, it is right-handed; if it would turn counterclockwise, it is left-handed. In Figure 6-03, the propeller at left is left-handed; the one at right is right-handed. It is not always easy to determine the hand of a propeller by looking at the rotation of the engine alone. The engine is connected to a transmission that may change engine rotation depending on its reduction gearing. The rotation of the coupling connecting the transmission to the propeller shaft is, however, a true indication of the propeller rotation. If, looking forward toward the transmission from aft of it, the shaft and coupling rotate clockwise when the transmission is in forward, then the shaft has a right-hand propeller.

Figure 6-03 If you stand at the stern of a boat that is out of the water and look at its propeller, you will be looking at the driving face of the propeller blades. If the propeller must turn to the right (clockwise) to push water toward you, the propeller is right-handed. If it would have to turn in the opposite direction for the same effect, it is left-handed.

Most, but not all, single-screw boats have right-hand propellers. In the maneuvering situations below, the propeller on a single-screw craft is right-handed unless otherwise noted.

Twin-screw craft almost always have the tops of the blades turning outward when going ahead for best maneuverability. Figure 6-03 can be viewed as the two propellers of a twin-screw craft; the port engine will turn a left-hand propeller, and the starboard engine a right-hand propeller. Skippers sometimes refer to propellers as “wheels,” especially when describing right- or left-handedness, but since most of the discussion in this chapter is about steering, we will use “propeller” exclusively.

### Hull Shape

In addition to propeller and rudder configuration, the hull shape of a boat has a strong influence on how it handles. Given the same wind and sea conditions, a trawler with its heavy displacement hull and deeper draft will behave differently than a lighter sport-fishing boat with its shallower draft, planing hull, flying bridge and, possibly, tuna tower; see Figures 6-04 and 6-05.

Figure 6-04 A deep-draft displacement hull, A, will tend to be set off course by adverse water currents, but its low freeboard and superstructure offer less resistance to the wind. Conversely, a typical planing hull, B, floats high in the water, and a wind on the beam will result in considerable leeway.

Figure 6-05 This sport-fishing boat with its planing-type hull has only part of its hull in contact with the water when it is on a plane.

Displacement-type hulls are heavily built and have a large load-carrying capacity, but are limited in the speed at which they can be driven through the water. Sailboats, recreational trawlers, and many large yachts fall into this category. Planing-type hulls are generally lighter. They have less draft and can be driven through the water fast enough to create a vertical force beneath the hull sufficient to lift a portion of the bottom clear of the water, reducing drag. As a planing hull slows down, it reaches a point where it reverts to displacement mode.

#### Wind & Current

A boat’s handling characteristics are affected by wind and current no matter what type of hull and power combination it has. Keeping a course or maneuvering in close quarters may be straightforward on a calm day during a slack tidal current, but the boat may become quite ill-mannered when coping with a stiff crosswind or crosscurrent. Since bows on many powerboats are higher than the sterns, they tend to fall off the wind when backing. A bow or stern thruster can be helpful; see this page.

Hull type has the most effect on how a boat reacts to the current. Displacement-type hulls with considerable draft are affected by current to a greater extent than shallower-draft, lighter, planing-type hulls. Water is much denser than air, so a half-knot crosscurrent may have more effect on a displacement cruiser than a 15- to 20-knot wind (a moderate to fresh breeze). On the other hand, given the same conditions, a planing-type hull with a high tuna tower could be more affected by wind than by current. But neither a displacement nor a planing boat can remain unaffected by either the wind or the current, one or the other of which will significantly affect the boat’s maneuverability. This becomes most apparent while running at low speed in close quarters.

Two boats of roughly the same size, one with a considerable hull draft forward but little aft and another with relatively greater draft aft but more superstructure forward, will have radically different handling qualities. The governing factor is the relative area presented above the water to the wind, compared with the areas in the water, both forward and aft.

### Helmsmen Must Develop Judgment

From the above and other variations in behavior, it is obvious that a boater must develop judgment based on understanding his boat and the forces acting on it. Combinations of conditions can be infinite, so he or she must be able to appraise the situation and act promptly.

Try to foresee possibilities, and have solutions in mind before problems arise. For instance, if you are running down a channel with a strong wind on your beam and you have the choice of which side of the channel to use, the windward side is the better bet. Should your engine stop or your steering fail, you will have more of a chance to get an anchor down before going aground on the leeward side.

By the same reasoning, you shouldn’t skirt the windward side of a shoal too closely. Or suppose that you are approaching a bridge (see Figure 6-06), with a narrow draw opening and a strong wind or current pushing you along. If you approach the opening at an angle and power fails, you will be in a jam. But if you think to straighten out your course while still some distance away, so that you will be shooting down the center of the opening in alignment with it, you will be safer because your straight course will carry you through in the clear.

Figure 6-06 When approaching a bridge with a narrow draw, aim for the center of the opening, so that if power should fail, your course will tend to carry your boat through in the clear.

In developing your “boat sense,” draw from as many sources as possible. Watch how experienced boaters handle their craft, but allow for differences in your own boat when you try similar maneuvers. And it almost goes without saying: if you are at the helm of a strange boat, go more slowly than normal, taking additional precautions.

## UNDERSTANDING PROPELLERS & RUDDERS

When under power, boats are driven through the water by the action of their propellers, which act like pumps—drawing in a stream of water from forward (when going ahead), and expelling it astern. Moving these streams of water aft creates an opposite forward thrust at the propellers, which is transmitted to the boat through the propeller shaft and its supporting structure. This drives the boat forward.

### How Propellers Create Thrust

The curved blades of a propeller are similar to other curved foils found on boats, including a sailboat’s sail or fin keel. When such a foil passes through a fluid, the flow is divided into two streams, one on either side of the foil. When a rudder is in a straight position, the water flows evenly on both sides. Turning the rudder causes an uneven flow, building pressure on one side and reducing it on the other. This pressure differential creates what is called lift. The rudder—and the stern to which it is attached—moves (is “lifted”) toward the low-pressure side, which turns the bow in the opposite direction.

A propeller blade creates force similarly. If propeller blades were flat rather than curved, and if the blades simply spun around without any angle to their direction of travel, the propeller would turn through the water like a disk, with equal flow on each side. However, this is not the case. The blades of a propeller are both curved and angled; as they pass through the water, they create lift. There is a low-pressure area on the side of the blade facing forward, and a high-pressure area on the side facing aft.

Although the water drawn into the propeller does not actually flow from directly ahead in a thin column, we can consider this to be the case for our purposes here. As the propeller ejects water, it imparts a twist or spiral motion to that water. (The direction of rotation is dependent on the way the propeller turns.) The flow of water into and away from the propeller is called the screw current.

#### Suction & Discharge Screw Currents

Regardless of whether the propeller is rotating to move the boat ahead or astern, the part of the current that flows into the propeller is called the “suction screw current.” The part of the current ejected from the propeller is called the “discharge current”; see Figure 6-07. Discharge current, spiral in motion, is a compact stream of water that exerts greater pressure than the broader suction current.

Figure 6-07 With a propeller turning ahead, suction screw current is developed by the water flowing toward the propeller, and discharge current is driven out astern.

Placing the rudder behind the propeller in the discharge current increases the steering effect because the rudder is acting in an accelerated flow. (Of course, there is a small rudder action from any flow of water past it even if the propeller is not turning.) A twin-screw cruiser has twin rudders, one behind each propeller, keeping the rudder blades directly in the propellers’ discharge currents.

The pressure difference created by the propeller blade creates lift, and its force is roughly perpendicular to the blade itself. Lift can be divided into two components—a thrust component in the direction of travel and a torque component in the opposite direction of propeller rotation; see Figure 6-08. You can easily see the effect of propeller torque when a runabout with a large engine accelerates; as the propeller begins to accelerate, the boat tends to dip on one side (generally on the port side with a right-hand propeller).

Figure 6-08 The blades of a propeller act as foils, providing lift, thrust, and torque.

There is also wake current—a body of water that is carried along by a vessel due to the friction on its hull as it moves through the water. This has its maximum effect at the surface, and little effect at keel depth.

#### Unequal Blade Thrust

Turning propellers not only create forward or reverse thrust with their discharge current, they also produce forces that tend to push the propeller to one side or the other, depending on the direction of rotation.

This effect is most noticeable on inboard boats that have a propeller shaft set through the hull at an angle to the horizontal. Since the propeller is attached to the end of this shaft, it is positioned at the same angle, and the water that flows into it meets the blades at different angles depending on whether they are on the downward or upward arcs of their rotations. The pitch of the blades as manufactured is the same, of course, but the effective pitch of one blade is increased, while the other is reduced. For example, a forward-turning right-hand propeller would have the pitch of its starboard (descending) blade increased, while the pitch of the port (ascending) blade would be decreased. The relatively greater blade pitch on the starboard side creates a stronger thrust on that side; see Figure 6-09. The importance of this factor is reduced as the shaft angle is decreased, and naval architects sometimes take pains to have the engine installed as low in the hull as possible so as to keep the propeller shaft nearly parallel to the flow of the water past the blades. This contributes to propeller efficiency and is a factor worth considering if it is consistent with other design requirements. In practical terms, the effect of unequal blade thrust varies with each design.

Figure 6-09 A propeller shaft at an angle to the horizontal has the effect of increasing the pitch of the descending blade relative to that of the ascending blade. This produces greater thrust to starboard in a right-hand propeller. A left-hand propeller would produce a greater thrust to port.

#### Effect of Unequal Blade Thrust

The relatively greater blade pitch on the starboard side creates a stronger thrust on that side. Unless other factors contravene, the stern of a single-screw boat with a right-hand propeller thus has a natural tendency to go to starboard when the propeller is going ahead. The opposite effect occurs when the propeller is reversing.

When such a craft has headway, its bow tends to turn to port, and a certain amount of right rudder may be needed to maintain a straight course. To correct this tendency, a small trim tab may be attached to the after edge of the rudder and bent to an angle that provides the proper compensation.

The effect of unequal blade thrust is so small for some boats as to be negligible, and quite pronounced on other craft. With left-hand propellers, the effect is, of course, just the opposite of that described above.

However, when the shaft angle is parallel to the flow of water into the propeller, another effect, the paddle wheel, or propwalk, may come into play. As an outboard motor is progressively raised, the propeller will eventually break the surface of the water. As this point is approached, a blade sweeping across the top, fanning through aerated water, will not pull as hard in a sideways or propeller torque direction as the fully submerged blade sweeping across the bottom of the propeller arc. This will cause a right-hand rotation propeller to “walk” to the right, much as a paddle wheel would do. This action in turn tries to pull the aft end of an outboard or sterndrive boat to the right, causing the boat to go into a left-hand turn, if not resisted at the steering wheel.

Unequal blade thrust becomes more of a concern to light single-engine craft at high speeds, when the propeller is elevated closer to the water surface; the paddle wheel (propwalk) effect will eventually dominate any steering torque situation.

#### Ventilation & Cavitation

Since all but a few high-speed, surface-piercing propellers (see Figure 6-10) rely on the smooth flow of water over their blades to create lift, a slight disturbance to this flow limits the overall efficiency of the propeller.

Figure 6-10 A high-performance system, such as the Arneson Drive, is designed to reduce drag while enhancing positive-thrust steering. It uses surface-piercing propellers.

Ventilation occurs when air from the water’s surface or exhaust gases are sucked into the discharge current. The propeller then loses its grip on the water and over-revs, losing much of its thrust. Trying to turn an outboard-powered boat too tightly at too high a speed often results in propeller ventilation.

Cavitation usually occurs at the tip of a propeller that is turning too fast. A spot on the tip of a propeller blade travels farther and faster during each revolution than does one near the hub. As the propeller rpms increase, the tip reaches a point where water simply can’t flow past the tip without creating a vacuum sufficient to cause the formation of water vapor bubbles: see Figure 6-11, A. As these water vapor bubbles move along the surface of the metal, they eventually find an area of higher pressure where they collapse and cause damage. When collapsing, the bubbles release their stored energy onto the metal, acting like tiny jackhammers; the result is known as “cavitation burn”; see Figure 6-11, B.

Figure 6-11 Cavitation results from a partial vacuum formed, A, by the blades of a propeller, with a consequent lost of thrust. There is also the danger of damage to the propeller when the cavitation bubbles collapse, as shown in B.

Cavitation may result from a number of causes, including nicks in the leading edge, sharp leading-edge corners (as shown), improper polishing, poor propeller design, severely bent blades, broken blade tips, or ventilation.

### How a Rudder Acts

Most inboard boats have a vertical rudder blade located at the stern, attached to a rudderpost that extends through a watertight stuffing box into the boat. Movement of the steering wheel turns the rudder to port or starboard. As described earlier, turning the rudder develops a higher pressure on one side of the rudder blade and a lower pressure on the other, creating lift. As the rudder is pulled toward its own lower-pressure side, it takes the stern of the boat with it.

Steering wheels on boats are rigged in such a way that they turn with the rudder—turning the helm to port turns the rudder to port. Turning the helm to port therefore gives left rudder; this then moves the stern to starboard, so that the bow in effect moves to port, starting a turn to the left. Conversely, turning the helm to starboard gives right rudder, throwing the stern to port, so that the boat then turns to starboard (to the right). On sailboats with tillers, the opposite is true.

#### Propeller Current’s Action on Rudder

If a boat is motionless in the water (regardless of motion with respect to the bottom caused by wind or current), turning the rudder will have no effect—there must be a flow of water past the rudder for it to exert a force on the stern of the craft. However, if the propeller is turning, the situation is quite different. Now the rudder blade is directly in the discharge current of the propeller, which is pumping a strong stream of water astern. Turning the rudder to one side deflects the stream, creating a thrust to the opposite side. Small rudders are effective when there is considerable propeller current or when the boat is moving at high speed, but they develop little turning force at slow speeds or when the propeller is not turning. Sailboats and most single-prop, heavy powerboats have large rudders and respond to the helm adequately at slow speeds.

At very slow propeller speeds, the boat’s headway may not be sufficient to provide steering control in wind or current. Take, for example, a strong wind on the port beam. Even with the rudder hard over to port, it may not be possible to turn into the wind until the propeller is speeded up enough to exert a more powerful thrust against the rudder blade. As a vessel travels through the water, the minimum speed at which it can be controlled is what is meant by steerageway.

### Turning Circles

When any boat has headway and the rudder is put over to make a turn (to starboard, for example), the stern is first pushed to the opposite side (in this example, to port). The boat then tends to slide off obliquely, in a crablike fashion. Its momentum will carry it a short distance along the original course before settling into a turn, in which the bow describes a smaller circle than the stern; see Figure 6-12. The pivot point is usually one-fourth to one-third of the boat’s length aft of the stem (see Figure 6-13), varying with boat trim and from one boat to the next. While there is always a loss of speed when making a turn, the size of a boat’s turning circle varies little with changes in speed, assuming a given rudder angle.

Figure 6-12 When a boat has headway and its rudder is turned to one side to make a turn, the stern moves in the opposite direction. Then, after sliding obliquely along the course from 1 to 2, it settles into a turn in which the bow follows a smaller circle (solid red line) than the stern (dotted red line).

Figure 6-13 With forward motion, when the helm is put over to one side, a boat pivots around a point about one-third of its length from the stem. Note that this causes the stern to swing in a wider arc than the bow.

The radius of the turning circle is much larger for single-screw inboard boats than for outboards (or sterndrive boats) because the shaft and propeller of the inboard are fixed on the centerline and cannot be rotated. A twin-screw inboard, on the other hand, provides excellent maneuverability, as will be seen later.

It is important to consider the position of the rudder with respect to the pivot point of the hull when the boat is reversing. In this case, the pivot may be about one-fourth of the hull length from the transom; see Figure 6-14. Therefore, the rudder is acting on a much shorter lever arm as it tries, sometimes in vain, to swing the hull off course.

Figure 6-14 When backing down with the rudder to port, the pivot point is about one-quarter of the boat length forward of the stern. The bow, therefore, describes a wider arc than the stern.

When the boat has sternway (reversing), there is no powerful discharge current past the rudder, only the weaker, more diffuse suction screw current. The rudder normally would be turned to port (left rudder) to turn the stern of the boat to port; right rudder should normally turn the stern to starboard in backing. Under certain circumstances, the effect of the reversing propeller “walking” itself the other way may more than offset the steering effect of the rudder. The stern of a boat with a left-hand prop may actually continue to turn to the right, for example, despite left rudder.

Water depth also has an effect on a boat’s steering. Even though the keel may be a foot or so above bottom, a boat’s response to rudder action in shallow water is almost always sluggish.

#### Keep Stern Free to Maneuver

If a boater understands the underlying difference between the steering of a boat and a car, he will be aware of the need to keep the stern free to maneuver in close quarters. The stern must have room to swing in the opposite direction from that in which the bow is being turned. This is especially important when the craft lies close to a pile or solid vertical surface; see Figure 6-15.

Figure 6-15 With right rudder, as the boat moves from 1 to 2, the stern is driven against the piles, with risk of damage. The rudder should be centered until the boat is clear (or better yet, the boat should be backed away from the face of the pier after a nudge forward to get the bow in and stern out).

This is also very important when towing either a skier or another boat. To ensure the maneuverability of the towing craft, a towline must be attached forward of the stern; see Figure 6-16.

Figure 6-16 A towline should be attached to a fitting well forward of the transom. This will allow the stern to swing more freely to either side for turning and provide greater overall maneuverability.

#### The Tendency to Stray Off Course

Some boats require varying rudder angles to compensate for the tendency to wander from a straight course. Depending on differences in construction, arrangement of rudder blade, and the hand of the propeller, the bow may fall off to port or to starboard.

For example, a certain group of boats of almost identical design had a strong tendency to pull off course to port. In some of them, the condition was corrected simply by lowering the rudder blade, without changing its size or shape but merely by lengthening the stock an inch or two.

Before that correction, the boats would make a quick and easy turn to port but would resist turning to starboard. As a matter of fact, unless steering controls were rigged with worm and gear to hold the wheels against pressure on the rudders, the boats would swing into a short circle to port the instant the wheels were left unattended. This exaggerated condition is far from normal, but it does illustrate the handling characteristics the helmsman must pay attention to, especially in an unfamiliar boat.

##### PROPULSION “PODS”

A recent design feature of many large ships is the use of propulsion “pods.” These are large streamlined bodies beneath the after part of the hull where propellers would normally be. Each pod contains a large electric motor that drives a forward- or aft-facing propeller. The pods can be rotated horizontally through 360° for steering; there are no rudders. Power is supplied by electrical cables from several generators driven by multiple, large diesel engines or gas turbines. The advantages are vastly increased maneuverability and the flexibility to locate the power-generating machinery anywhere in the ship. Increased fuel efficiency is achieved—only those engines or turbines and generators need be run that are sufficient to meet the power needs of the moment.

Most ships have two pods, but some will have three or four, with the additional pods being fixed. Vessels range in size from 40,000 to 142,000 gross tons or more. Individual pods are rated at 9,000 to 21,500 horsepower (6.7 to 16 MW).

A generally similar concept has been developed for medium-size recreational craft; see this page.

### Steering with Propeller Thrust

Here is a procedure that can often be helpful. In close quarters, a boat can often be turned in a couple of lengths by applying brief bursts of engine power; see Figure 6-17. If, for example, the rudder is set hard to starboard (right rudder) while the craft has no headway, and the throttle is suddenly advanced significantly, then quickly closed, the stern can be kicked around to port before the boat has a chance to gather significant headway. The exact technique of turning in limited space is described in detail later in this chapter.

Figure 6-17 When a boat with a right-hand prop is dead in the water, engaging forward gear walks the stern to starboard. The amount of movement depends upon the boat and the throttle applied. If the rudder is put over to port, the movement is greater.

## BOAT HANDLING WITH A SINGLE SCREW

While this section focuses on the handling of single-screw boats, twin-screw boats and craft using directed thrust—outboard motors, sterndrives, pod drives, and jet drives—are also considered in this chapter. Although single-screw inboard-engine boats may be in the minority of modern small craft, the basic principles of boat handling are best explained by first considering the actions and reactions of a craft with one inboard engine, one shaft, one propeller, and one rudder.

A single-screw inboard boat relies on water flowing past the rudder for maneuvering power. This is provided by the movement of the boat through the water and by the discharge current from the propeller (or suction current if backing down). How well your boat responds to the helm in any given situation will depend largely on constant factors such as unequal blade thrust, propwalk, and hull type. The variable factors are wind, current, and the amount of rudder angle being used.

Every time you leave your berth, certain basic maneuvers are necessary—getting underway, turning, stopping, and backing down. Next is a description of how to perform these maneuvers in a single-engine inboard boat with a right-hand propeller. In addition, you will learn about why your boat sometimes seems to have a mind of its own.

### Gathering Headway

Getting underway should be straightforward, but when you put the boat into forward gear with the rudder centered, it may not behave as you would expect. When you shift into forward gear and the propeller starts to turn ahead, unequal blade thrust tends to move the stern to starboard. This can be frustrating when pulling away from a starboard-side berth. If you don’t get your boat far enough away from the pier or wharf, the stern may swing in and hit it.

Compensating by using right rudder may help, but it could also hamper the maneuver of getting away from the structure. The proper way to depart a wharf or pier is to back out—here the natural tendency of a boat will pull the stern out, and when the boat is clear of the structure, it can go forward, parallel to the wharf or pier face, at an adequate distance from it. If there is any tendency for wind or current to pin the boat against the wharf or pier face, go ahead on an after bow spring to get the stern out (see this page).

As the boat gathers headway, the flow of water past a centered rudder acts to resist any turning action of the craft. This counters the effect of unequal blade thrust, and the average boat will normally hold course in a straight line fairly well.

From a purely theoretical standpoint, unequal blade thrust with a right-hand propeller should tend to move the stern to starboard and the bow to port. Once underway, the effect of unequal blade thrust is quite slight. Only in comparatively few cases will unequal blade thrust have a pronounced effect on steering, and in these it can be corrected by a small rudder tab.

### Turning

Now that your boat has headway, assume the rudder is turned to starboard. The water flowing past the hull strikes the rudder on its starboard side, forcing the stern to port. The propeller’s discharge current intensifies this effect by acting on the same side, and the boat’s bow turns to starboard, the same side on which the rudder is set.

How fast a boat will react to its helm depends on the size of the rudder and on hull shape, but the most influential factor is how fast water is flowing past the rudder. At slow speeds, with the engine idling or turning slowly, a heavy boat will register a considerable lag between the time its helm is put over and the time the boat begins to turn. At idle speeds, there is less water flowing past the rudder, and the propeller discharge current is weak; it may take a boat several seconds to begin a turn. You may also have to give the boat considerably more rudder to get the same response you achieve at higher speeds.

Of course, the opposite is also true. A boat traveling fast experiences a powerful flow of water past the rudder; with a strong propeller discharge current, it responds much more quickly to helm movement. At speed, a light, fast, planing-type inboard has a very positive feel to the helm, with no noticeable lag between helm movement and turning.

The boat’s turning radius is determined by how much the helm is turned at both high and slow speeds. How quickly the boat responds to helm movement is basically a factor of how fast it is moving.

### Stopping

A boat has no brakes—stopping is achieved by reversing the propeller rotation. Assume that your boat has headway, with the rudder centered, propeller turning in reverse. The rudder has decreasing steering effect as the boat slows, and unequal blade thrust of the reversed propeller tends to throw the stern to port. At the same time, on some boats the propeller blades on the starboard side are throwing their discharge current in a powerful column forward against the starboard side of the keel and bottom of the boat, with little on the port side to offset this pressure. This also adds to the forces moving the stern to port.

If wind and current permit, a skipper should make a port-side approach to a pier or wharf with a single-engine boat that has a right-hand propeller. When the engine is reversed, the propeller will walk the stern toward rather than away from the pier.

### Backing Down

If the boat is lying dead in the water with no headway, rudder centered, and the propeller turning in reverse, we again have the strong tendency of the stern to go to port as the discharge current strikes the starboard side of the hull. In each case where the discharge current of the reversing propeller is a factor, the strong current on the starboard side is directed generally toward the boat’s bow, but upward and inward in a spiral movement. The descending blade on the port side, on the other hand, tends to throw its stream downward at such an angle that its lesser force is largely spent below the keel. Therefore, the two forces are never of equal effect.

Until the boat gathers sternway from its backing propeller (right-hand), it would not matter if the rudder were over to port or starboard. The discharge current against the starboard side is still the strong controlling factor, and thus the stern will be moved to port.

Now visualize the boat gathering sternway as the propeller continues to turn in reverse. Here arises one of the seemingly mystifying conditions that baffle many a new helmsman. The novice assumes that in order to back in a straight line the rudder must be centered, just as it must be when going ahead on a straight course. But under certain conditions the boat may even respond to right rudder as the boater reverses by going to port, which is totally unexpected.

If the boater is learning by trial-and-error, it is easy to come to the conclusion that it depends on the boat’s fancy, while rudder position has nothing to do with control. Fortunately, something can be done about it.

#### Backing with Left Rudder

Consider a boat in reverse with left rudder. Here there are four factors all working together to throw the stern to port. Unequal blade thrust is pushing the stern to port; the discharge current of the propeller is adding its powerful effect; and now we add the steering effect of the wake current acting on the after side of the rudder blade, against which the suction current of the propeller is also working.

Remember this condition well, for it is the answer to why practically every single-screw vessel with right-hand propeller easily backs to port, although it may be obstinate about backing to starboard.

#### Backing with Rudder Centered

If, while backing to port, you bring the rudder amidships, you eliminate the effects of suction current and steering from the rudder. This leaves unequal blade thrust and the discharge current to continue forcing the stern to port.

#### Backing with Right Rudder

Assuming further that you have not yet gathered much sternway, you might expect that putting the rudder to starboard should make the boat back to starboard. The forces of unequal blade thrust and discharge current still tend to drive the stern to port, but the suction current of the propeller wants to offset this.

The effect of the discharge current is stronger than the suction, so the overall tendency is still to port. With sternway, the steering effect of the right rudder is to starboard, but as yet you haven’t way enough to make this offset the stronger factors.

#### Steering while Backing

Opening the throttle to gain more sternway finally has the desired effect; with full right rudder you will find that the steering effect at considerable backing speed is enough (probably) to turn the stern to starboard against all the opposing factors. How well the boat will back to starboard—if at all—depends upon the design of the craft.

All of this means that if the boat will back to starboard with full right rudder, it may also be made to back in a straight line—but not with the rudder centered. There’s no use trying. The boat will need a certain amount of right rudder, depending both on its design and on speed. While most boats always back to port much better than to starboard, a boater can learn to control a particular boat with a reasonable degree of precision.

In some cases, boats may even be steered backward out of crooked slips or channels—not, however, without a lot of backing and filling when there is much wind to complicate the situation. Generally, the trick is to keep the boat under control, making the turns no greater than necessary to keep the boat from swinging too much.

In backing situations, set the rudder first and then add maneuvering power by speeding up the propeller.

#### Killing Sternway

There is one other situation to be considered, where you want to kill sternway by engaging the propeller to turn ahead. Regardless of the rudder position, unequal blade thrust with the propeller going ahead now tends to throw the stern to starboard, while the suction current is of little or no consequence. In this situation, unequal blade thrust may or may not be offset by the steering effect and the discharge current.

With rudder amidships, there is no steering effect and the discharge current does not enter into calculations. Therefore the stern will go to starboard. Now if you turn the rudder to port, the discharge current of the propeller strikes the rudder and pushes the stern to starboard—even though the normal steering effect of left rudder with sternway would be to send the stern to port. The powerful discharge current from the propeller going ahead is the determining factor.

If the rudder is turned to starboard with sternway, the steering effect works with the unequal blade thrust, tending to move the stern to starboard, but the discharge current strikes the starboard side of the rudder and acts to kick the stern to port. If you apply enough power that the force of discharge current outweighs the other factors, the stern will indeed go to port.

### Propeller Action Governs

From the above analysis it is clear that in a single-screw inboard boat you must be constantly aware of what the propeller is doing in order to know how best to use the rudder. What the propeller is doing is even more important than whether the boat has headway or sternway.

##### STEP-BY-STEP DOCKING WITH A SINGLE-SCREW BOAT

With a right-hand propeller, back to port in order to line up with your slip. How fast you can turn your boat determines where to stop and when you should begin backing. A high freeboard and flybridge may react to a crosswind, so choose your moment so as to avoid sudden gusts.

Propeller action will help most single-screw boats turn to port when backing. With the helm hard to port, the boat should begin a turn to line up with the slip.

Usually a boat will need some help kicking its stern farther to port to align itself with the slip. Going ahead with a short burst of power, with helm over to starboard, will accomplish this. Some right rudder will probably be needed to make the boat back in a straight line into the slip, but remember that the torque of the propeller to port (in reverse) often has more influence than the position of the rudder. If a short burst of power is needed, position the rudder first, then apply power.

1 Shift into reverse to stop the boat, then put the helm over hard to port to start the turn into the slip. A slight increase in power will cause the boat to turn a bit quicker.

2 Shift into forward as you enter, put the helm over to starboard and open the throttle for a short burst of power. This kicks the stern to port, aligning the boat with the slip.

3 Shift into reverse and keep the helm to starboard in order to overcome the propeller walk to port and back straight into the slip.

4 When fully in the slip, put the gear in forward briefly to stop sternway. Keep the helm to starboard in order to kick the stern closer to the dock—helm to port if it is too close.

#### It’s Different with Left-Hand Propellers

A significant minority of single-screw powerboats, typically displacement types, and auxiliary-powered sailboats have left-hand propellers. Many commercial boats also have left-hand propellers, as this makes it easier for them to execute a starboard-side approach and departure from a pier or wharf.

If your boat is equipped with a left-hand propeller, you can generally reverse “port” and “starboard” in the foregoing discussions. But to be absolutely sure, make tests for all possible situations.

## MANEUVERING IN TIGHT QUARTERS

Since most marinas and anchorages are congested places, handling a boat in these confined spaces can be a real test of your skills. In fact, in some harbors, leaving and returning to your berth can be the most harrowing part of a cruise. Most of the basic maneuvers that you will need to get underway from and return to your slip are covered below.

### Getting Underway

As skipper, you are responsible for the safe operation of your boat. Before you leave the berth, be sure that all your getting-underway procedures are completed. Make sure that all electrical cords and hoses are disconnected before taking off last-minute dock lines. Avoid spending too much time at the pier warming up the engine; long periods of idling are not good for the engine or transmission, which will warm up faster operating under a light load.

#### Getting Clear of Your Berth

When the boat is lying alongside a pier or another craft, and the skipper wants to pull away, the wheel should never be put hard over until the stern is clear.

To set the rudder to starboard while lying portside to a pier or wharf, for example, and then attempt to pull away by going ahead (refer to Figure 6-15) only tends to throw the port quarter against the piles and pin it there, possibly slamming into one pile after another and damaging the boat.

### Checking Headway

Stopping a boat’s headway will require reversing the propeller. Experiment with stopping the boat from different speeds. This will give you an idea about the propeller’s ability to check the boat’s headway. Consider the following:

• Generally, a larger diameter propeller, acting on a large volume of water, will exert a greater effect. Small propellers, especially those on outboards, may do a lot of churning before they can overcome the boat’s momentum.

• You can stop a fast boat in a short distance by cutting the throttles. Then, as the boat comes off of plane, shift into reverse and apply power.

• When practicing these maneuvers, take the following precaution: When you need to go from forward to reverse or vice versa, slow the engine down before going through neutral. Also warn crewmembers and passengers of your intentions so that they will not be unexpectedly thrown off balance, possibly being injured. Never make a practice of shifting from full ahead into full astern—you will tear up the gears.

• Always remember to approach piers as well as other craft at a very slow speed. Failure of the transmission, or an unexpected stopping of the engine, can result in embarrassment, damage, or both.

### Turning in Close Quarters

Although turning a boat in a narrow channel or other confined waterway not much wider than the boat itself may seem impossible to the novice, it is really no more difficult than turning a car around on a narrow road.

Suppose, for example, that you have reached the head of a dead-end canal and must turn around (see the sequential illustrations in Figure 6-18). Assuming you have a single-screw boat with a right-hand propeller, steer to the left side of the channel and make all forward maneuvers to starboard and backing maneuvers to port, to take advantage of the boat’s natural tendencies. Now, running at slow speed, put the rudder hard over to starboard and, as the boat begins to turn, check headway by reversing. Leave the wheel hard over to starboard (right rudder). Very little is gained by applying right rudder while going ahead and left rudder while going astern, since the boat will make little way through the water. As the reversing propeller stops the boat, open the throttle for an instant; the stern will be kicked farther to port. Then put the gear in forward and open the throttle for a short burst of power, to check any sternway and keep the stern swinging to port. As soon as the boat gathers headway, shift into reverse and back down to kick the stern to port; then shift into forward again.

Figure 6-18 Turning in close quarters with a single right-hand propeller: In Step A, at 1, the boat starts to turn at the left side of the channel; make allowance for the stern to swing to port. Headway is checked at 2 by reversing the propeller, with the rudder kept to starboard throughout this series of maneuvers. Unequal blade thrust and discharge current force the stern to port as the boat backs from 2 to 3 in Step B. Going ahead again with a short burst of engine power, Step C, the stern is kicked around more at 4 before the boat has a chance to gain headway. Reversing once more in Step D, headway is checked at 4, and the boat backs to 5. (This forward and backing maneuver can be repeated as necessary.) Finally, in Step E, the boat goes ahead from 5 to 6, completing the change of direction.

Most single-screw inboard boats can be maneuvered in very tight quarters by using this technique. Unequal propeller thrust in combination with rudder action turns the boat. Remember, however, that this applies only for a right-hand propeller; reverse the technique for a left-hand propeller.

### Backing to Port from a Slip

When leaving a slip, an experienced skipper will back a single-screw boat with a right-hand propeller to port. Suppose the boat is lying in a slip and you intend to back out into the channel. With left rudder, it will likely turn fast enough as it gathers sternway, aligning with the channel in one maneuver.

Before putting the boat in reverse, pull the boat to the port side of the slip, ensuring as much clearance as possible on the starboard side. Although some room is necessary on the port side because the stern immediately starts to move to port, more room is required on the starboard side because the bow will swing this way as the boat backs.

The starboard bow and port stern are the places to watch in executing this maneuver. If the boat turns sharper than expected, the starboard bow is in danger of touching the adjacent pier (see Figure 6-19) or a boat in the adjacent slip. This could be corrected by going ahead with the propeller a few revolutions while backing out of the slip. Once the bow is clear of the slip, right rudder followed by a short burst of power in forward will help kick the stern over to port if it is not turning fast enough while making sternway.

Figure 6-19 To back out of a slip, a boat should be able to make a short turn to port from 1 to 3 when reversing with left rudder. However, if the bow swings too wide, it may hit at X or Y.

### Backing Around to Starboard

In a different scenario, suppose you want to back out of the same situation outlined above or from a slip into a narrow canal that would require a sharp turn to starboard; see Figure 6-20.

Figure 6-20 To back around to starboard where space is limited, the boat starts at 1 with right rudder and backs to 2, as it cannot turn sharply to starboard. At 2, the rudder is turned to port, and the stern is kicked to starboard at position 3 with a brief burst of engine power. From 3, the boat is backed to 4 with full right rudder. Here the rudder is put over to port again, and the boat moves forward to 5. Backing down from 5, it will need a certain amount of right rudder to maintain a straight course.

Reversing with full right rudder, you will not be able to turn short enough to steer around the 90° angle before you would come up on the opposite canal bank. Most likely, you will back to a position somewhere in the middle of the canal with the stern slightly to starboard. Now, by going ahead with left rudder, the stern is kicked farther over to starboard.

Reversing once more, with full right rudder, the boat backs to starboard and, just as it begins to make sternway, you go ahead once more with left rudder. This checks the sternway and kicks the stern to starboard in alignment with the channel.

### Backing into a Berth Between Piles

Many marinas and yacht clubs provide slips in which boats are berthed at right angles to a pier or wharf and made fast to piles. Normally, a short secondary pier, often called a finger pier or catwalk, extends out between each pair of slips. In this situation, it is much easier to board the boat if it is moored with the stern toward the main pier or wharf. This arrangement makes for an easy departure, but requires backing into the slip upon return.

There are many variables that come into play as you back into a slip. Wind, current, and the location of other boats are just a few. At times, some of these factors may be so disconcerting that you may decide not to back into the slip, but instead to dock bow first until conditions improve. A wise man who said “Discretion is the better part of valor” must have been thinking of this situation.

Now let’s consider a typical situation: You have spent a nice day on the water and are returning to your slip—one of hundreds located on a pier in a large marina; you want to back in. As you turn into the channel, the slip is to port and you are moving with a light wind and current astern. The channel is only a couple of boat lengths wide, so there is not much room for maneuvering. In this situation, the port side of the channel should be favored to allow for wind and current. Begin your turn before the slip, in order to position the boat upwind and/or up-current of it.

Depending on how quickly the boat can be turned, put the helm over to starboard well before you reach the slip. Because the channel is narrow, the boat will not be able to turn more than 90°, almost into the wind, in a single maneuver; see Figure 6-21. As the bow approaches the other side of the channel, shift into reverse and open the throttle to stop headway and kick the stern to port. As soon as the boat gathers sternway, reduce throttle, then shift to forward and open the throttle again to kick the stern farther to port; position the boat at about a 45° angle to the slip.

Figure 6-21 Backing into a slip between piles in a basin, if space allows, make a turn ahead under power to maneuver the bow partly into the wind before backing down. Note that the right rudder in positions 7 and 8 keeps the stern from swinging to port.

The turn should be timed so that the final position of the boat is slightly upwind from the slip, with the wind and current off the starboard bow. If you are not upwind of the slip, complete the turn and run upwind until you are. If you are too far upwind, wait for the current to push you down closer to the slip.

Begin backing with right rudder. As soon as you start backing, the current and wind will push the bow to port so that, by the time the stern is entering the slip, the boat will be nearly in line with the slip. Remember, when backing a boat with a right-hand propeller, use left rudder in combination with a short burst of forward power to move the stern to starboard. Left rudder with propeller reversing should move the stern to port.

### Getting Clear of a Pile

In maneuvering around slips and piles, you may be caught in a position where the wind and/or current hold the boat against the pile, preventing any maneuver. The solution is to rig a forward spring line from the pile to an aft cleat, preferably on the side of the boat away from the pile; see Figure 6-22. Then, by reversing with left rudder, pivot the boat around the pile and bring the bow into the wind or against the current or the wind, whichever predominates. You can then clear the pile by going ahead with power as the spring is cast off.

Figure 6-22 If pinned against a piling, use a forward spring line from a stern cleat (and apply a bit of reverse power) to swing the boat into the wind or current.

In getting clear from this point, you may need a little left rudder to keep the stern clear of the pile, but don’t use enough to throw the stern so far over that the starboard quarter is in danger of hitting an adjacent pile.

### Plan Maneuvers in Advance

Obviously the number of possible situations—considering the differences in boats and the strength, direction, and effect of wind and current—is almost infinite. Usually, however, applying one of the principles above, modified as needed, will permit a seamanlike handling of the problem.

Even though you know the principles, however, it pays to think ahead about the steps you will take. With a clear plan of action, you can take each step slowly and easily and have time to keep the boat under perfect control. To avoid confusion, tell your crew the steps you plan to follow, the actions that each crewmember will have to take, and the orders you will give when these actions are required. Even on occasions that call for swift and decisive action, you’ll need calm, ordered judgment.

If your planned maneuver is not working, don’t hesitate to stop, reevaluate the situation, and develop a new plan. For example, if your plan for a clean approach to a pier or wharf has been upset by a freak current you couldn’t calculate or by a passing boat’s wake, back off and square away for another attempt. That in itself is good seamanship, regardless of how some may judge your apparent “miss” on the first try. Common sense, if you act with deliberation, will enable you to work out a solution for any combination of conditions.

When you are at the helm and you have people on deck handling lines, give orders to each so that all action is under your control, instead of having two or three acting independently at cross-purposes. This is especially imperative when your crew is not familiar with boats or with your method of boat handling.

## DOCK LINES & THEIR USES

Dock lines (also called mooring lines) play an important part in the handling of vessels at a pier. Obviously, as boat size increases, more and heavier lines are needed. A small, light outboard craft requires fewer lines for secure docking than does a heavy 50-foot trawler. But all skippers should know and understand how lines are used so that they can decide which lines are appropriate in any circumstance.

In addition to securing a boat in its berth, the proper use of lines can aid maneuvering close to piers and wharves.

### Dock-Line Terminology

Although most skippers speak quite loosely of bow and stern lines, it generally matters little as long as the line is made fast forward or aft. However, there are several lines that can be secured to the bow or stern and, depending on their direction and use, these are given other names. (Note that “forward” and “after” relate to the direction in which a line runs from the vessel, not to where it is made fast on board.) Figure 6-23 illustrates eight possible lines; Figure 6-24 shows just those lines that might be used in a typical small-craft docking situation.

Figure 6-23 The various possible dock lines for a vessel include the eight shown here. A small-craft skipper will never need to use all of them at the same time. The stern line, 8 in the diagram, is best run to the offshore side of the boat to gain better control while holding the stern closer to the wharf or pier.

Figure 6-24 As shown in this typical small-craft docking, crossing spring lines provides greater length for each. This is particularly desirable where there is a significant tidal range.

#### Bow & Stern Lines

According to correct nautical terminology, there is only one bow line. This is made fast to a forward cleat and run forward along the pier or wharf to prevent the boat from moving astern. The stern line leads from an after cleat to a pile or cleat on the pier astern of the boat; this line checks the boat from going ahead. When securing a small craft, these lines can be sufficient to keep the boat next to the dock. If given the proper slack, they can allow for considerable rise and fall of the tide.

#### Breast Lines

Breast lines are lines secured to the bow and stern that lead athwartships nearly at right angles to the vessel and to the pier or wharf. They are used on larger vessels to keep the craft from moving away from the pier or to pull it in for boarding. Large craft may use bow or quarter breasts, depending on where they are secured. Breast lines are more important on large vessels than on small ones.

#### Additional Cleats

Smaller recreational boats frequently will have only one bitt or cleat forward and one or two aft, for securing dock lines. Additional cleats along the sides, properly through-bolted, give better flexibility in the use of dock lines.

#### Spring Lines

Although only two spring lines are usually used, there may be as many as four: the forward bow spring, the after bow spring, the forward quarter spring, and the after quarter spring. Bow springs are made fast at the bow or to a forward side cleat; quarter springs run from the stern or an after side cleat. Forward springs lead forward from the vessel to the pier or wharf, and control movement sternward. After springs lead aft from the vessel, and check movement ahead.

Spring lines are used to prevent movement in a berth, ahead or astern. They work with the bow and stern lines to keep a boat in position when there is a significant rise and fall of tide. This is particularly desirable where boat movement forward and aft must be minimized so that fenders are kept in place against piles, or where the gap between adjacent vessels is small.

### Sizing the Line to the Boat

On most recreational boats, dock lines are made from nylon, either of twisted rope or braided core and cover. Nylon is the preferred material because it stretches, thereby absorbing shock loads; it is chafe-resistant for long life; and it is easy on the hands.

A line’s size varies with the boat. Typically, a 20- to 40-foot craft will use ½-inch-diameter nylon lines, with larger yachts using ⅝- or ¾-inch lines. Smaller boats can use ⅜-inch nylon. Dock lines should be strong enough to hold the boat and have enough bulk to resist chafe, while not being so heavy as to lose their shock-absorbing characteristics. A light boat pulling against a ⅝-inch line will come up hard against the line because the weight of the boat is not enough to cause the line to begin to stretch. On the other hand, a light ⅜-inch line holding a heavy boat will be very springy and probably only strong enough for favorable conditions. Moreover, ⅜-inch lines provide no margin for wear and chafe when under heavy strain.

##### BOW THRUSTERS

Many medium-size and larger craft are now equipped with a bow thruster. This is a small propeller (or two of them) mounted in a tunnel that crosses from one side of the hull to the other just below the waterline and very near the bow. Bow thrusters on boats are smaller versions of devices found on most large ships. They are powered by either an electric or a hydraulic motor. Electrically powered thruster installations are simpler and less expensive, but cannot be operated continuously. Hydraulic thrusters may be self-contained or powered from a hydraulic power system installed for other machinery. Smaller units have a single propeller; larger units have two counter-rotating propellers or two propellers with opposite blade angles turning in the same direction; there does not seem to be any significant advantage or disadvantage in these variations in design. Thrusters are rated in motor horsepower or pounds of thrust developed.

Bow thrusters are reversible, sending a jet of water to either side. Controls usually consist of a small joystick at each helm position, together with an on-off switch. Motors are operated in either direction at a fixed speed. To keep size and weight at a minimum, electrical motors are small and must be operated intermittently to prevent heat buildup and damage. On sophisticated installations, a thruster may be retractable rather than in a tunnel, being lowered for use and retracted within the hull when not needed.

Bow thrusters are of the greatest assistance to single-screw vessels, but are also quite useful on twin-screw craft. They are primarily used in docking and undocking, situations where they can be of significant help. They may also assist in making sharp turns in rivers and channels. The fact that they are used only infrequently does not detract from their overall value—when you need one, it’s good to have it!

Seldom seen, but quite practical, are stern thrusters. These have the motor and small propeller of a bow thruster, but not the tunnel. They are usually mounted beneath a swim platform on single-screw craft such as trawlers. The purpose is the same as for bow thrusters, assistance in docking or other close-quarters maneuvers.

### Making a Boat Fast to a Pier

Although many people will speak of “tying up” a boat in a slip or to a pier, this is not correct nautical terminology. A vessel of any size is “made fast” to the shore.

As described above (and illustrated in Figure 6-23) there are at least eight dock lines that might be used to secure a boat; they are not all used at the same time. Most average-sized boats can be made fast to a pier or wharf using four lines. The after bow spring is crossed with the forward quarter spring and secured to separate pier cleats or piles; refer to Figure 6-24. This arrangement provides longer springs, which can be drawn up rather snugly and still allow for a rise and fall of tide. If only one pile or cleat is available on shore, position your boat so that this point is opposite amidships; then run both springs to it. The lines will be shorter, but still effective.

The bow and stern lines should make roughly a 45° angle with the pier. The stern line can be secured to the near-shore quarter cleat, but will work better if run to the offshore quarter cleat. The longer line will allow the boat to rise and fall with the tide and better keep the boat in close to the pier.

If there is an offshore wind blowing, you may want to rig a slack breast line to the near-shore quarter cleat in order to pull the boat into the pier against the wind for easy boarding. However, you must always remember to loosen the line as the tide rises or falls, and to allow plenty of slack during the night or when the boat is untended.

Dock lines frequently have an eye splice in one end but not the other. You must decide whether to use the end with a loop on shore or on the boat. If you are going to be on board, it is better to retain the plain end on board. This means that you can make adjustments without getting off the boat. If there will be no one on the boat, use the end with the eye on board; the plain end ashore will allow adjustment without the necessity of boarding. Figure 6-25 illustrates the most secure method of making the eye end of a line fast to a cleat. For securing the plain end to a cleat, see Chapter 23, this page.

Figure 6-25 Most cleats on boats consist of a crossbar elevated from the deck by two legs (see Figure 1-28). The most secure method of attaching a line to such a cleat is by passing the eye through the gap between the legs and then back over each end of the crossbar.

#### Heaving Lines & Monkey’s Fists

A part of good seamanship is knowing when a certain procedure is applicable to the size of vessel that you are on, as when getting dock lines from your boat to the shore or another craft. The lines of a big ship are heavy hawsers, hard to handle and impossible to heave. The deck crew of such a vessel makes use of heaving lines, light lines weighted at one end with a monkey’s fist (an intricate woven knot enclosing a weight) for greater accuracy in heaving. This light line is attached to the hawser near the eye splice—but not in the loop where it might get jammed when a strain is placed on the hawser—and the line is heaved over from the ship to the pier or wharf as soon as possible as a messenger. The heavier line, or hawser, is then pulled over and made fast.

Small-Craft Practices On recreational boats, heaving lines is more of a technique to be learned and then filed away for possible later emergency use. Normally, your crew can hand a line to someone ashore, or throw it a short distance.

To throw a line to someone on shore or another boat, coil the line in your left hand (if you are right-handed), making clockwise loops. Coil the line smoothly, avoiding figure-eights, then transfer about half the loops to your throwing (right) hand and hurl them with a strong swinging motion while letting the loops play out freely from your other hand. Hold tightly to the bitter end or, better yet, secure it to a cleat. Figure 6-26 shows a line being prepared by a right-handed person. If necessary, a weight can be added to carry a line farther, but this is seldom needed. If you need to pass over a heavy towline, however, break out your heaving line and use it to good advantage.

Figure 6-26 A properly coiled dock line can be thrown a significant distance if you start with half the coil in each hand.

#### If Lines Are Doubled

If two lines are used with the idea of getting double the strength of one, they must be of equal length. Otherwise, the short one carries the full load until it breaks, leaving the single longer line to then carry the same full load.

##### MAKING FAST

When mooring your boat, fasten the lines securely at both ends. Often you will loop the eye splice of the dock line around a pile. If your boat has much freeboard, or the tide is high, the mooring line will lead down sharply from deck to pier. To prevent it from being pulled up off the pile, loop the eye splice around the pile twice. If the eye in your mooring line is too small to go around the pile twice, or even fit over the pile once, pull the line through the spliced eye to make a new loop.

If yours is to be the second line on a pile or cleat, it is both prudent and courteous to dip your line through the first loop. The other skipper may not know the trick of getting his line clear without removing yours. To drop a line over a pile that already holds another boat’s line, run the eye of your line up through the first eye from below, then loop it over the pile; see the illustration at right. This will allow either line to be removed without disturbing the other.

If you find that another skipper has dropped the eye in his line over yours on a pile or cleat, simply reverse the process. Pull the other line to get a little slack, and then slip your eye up through its loop and over the top of the pile. Your line then can be dropped through the eye of the other and pulled clear.

When leaving a pier or maneuvering against spring or other dock lines, it is convenient to be able to release the line from the pile or cleat—from on board the boat—as soon as you get away from the pier. By looping a long line around the pile or cleat and having both ends on board, you can easily release it. Slip one end around the pile or cleat, then pull it back on board. Be sure to release the end of the line without the eye splice, so it will run freely around the pile or cleat without hanging up at the splice.

If the lead is high from the pier or wharf to the deck, take an extra turn around the pile with the eye splice to prevent the line from slipping up off the top of the pile.

If you need to place your line on a pile that already has one on it, pass the loop of your line up through the loop of the first line and then over the top on the pile.

#### Allowing for Tidal Range

Boaters on freshwater streams and lakes have no tides to worry about when they make fast to a pier. But in tidal waters, failure to consider the tides can part lines, and may even sink the boat.

Long spring lines provide the most effective method for leaving a boat free to rise and fall. They also keep the boat from going ahead or astern, moving off fenders, or twisting in such a way as to get caught on pier projections. The longer a spring, bow, or stern line can be, the greater the tidal range it can accommodate with a minimum of slack. Long lines also allow each line to be adjusted so they don’t all come taut or excessively slack simultaneously as the tide falls or rises; see Figure 6-27.

Figure 6-27 This illustration shows how long spring lines are used with considerable changes in tidal levels. If the water drops 11 feet from E to D, a 32-foot after bow spring line (A to F at high water, A to B at low water) would cause the boat to move astern only the distance from F to B, roughly 2 feet.

Adjust the dock lines to come up almost taut at either of the extreme tidal ranges; this adjustment may take some experimentation. Observe the boat at both high and low tide, and adjust the lines so they are snug, but not tight, at these stages.

If you keep your boat in a slip, it is important to check the lines at times of extreme high and low tides. Make sure the lines are not so slack that the boat can move against a pile or finger pier.

When berthing in a narrow slip with a large tidal range, it may be impossible to keep the boat from coming against a pile or pier. Careful placement of fenders, on the boat or secured to the pier or piling, may be the only way to protect your boat; be sure to use spring lines.

### Maneuvering Against Dock Lines

Depending on current and wind, getting in and out of your slip or away from a pier can at times be challenging. Spring lines are the most useful dock lines, as they can be used to assist maneuvering.

#### Going Ahead on an After Bow Spring

If it is possible to secure an after spring close to the boat’s pivot point (about one-third the way aft from the bow) or amidships, the boat can then be worked into a pier by running ahead slowly with the rudder turned away from the pier; see Figure 6-28. Since the stern is free to swing as the discharge current acts on the rudder, the boat will move toward—and come in closer to—the pier. This technique is especially useful when maneuvering short-handed, bringing the boat against the pier by simply passing a single line ashore. It is also helpful when maneuvering a large boat against a stiff offshore wind, where hauling in on bow and stern lines would require great effort. This is typically more theoretical than practical on many small boats, which have only the bow and stern (or quarter) cleats for securing spring lines to, while the pivot point is well aft of the bow. If it is at all possible, install a cleat on each side of your boat slightly forward of amidships.

Figure 6-28 By going ahead on an after bow spring line, as shown at A, a boat’s bow is pulled into the pier, but the stern swings away from shore. If the rudder is turned away from the pier, as at B, the stern will swing in as power is applied. This maneuver works best if there is a cleat back from the bow, nearer the pivot point of the boat.

#### Reversing on a Spring or Bow Line

The stern is swung sharply toward the pier by the action of the forward quarter spring when reversing; see Figure 6-29. Since stern movement is restricted, there is much less control. The bow is free to swing away from the pier with the wind or current. If you back on a forward bow spring or on a bow line, the stern is not as restricted, and the line has less effect on turning the boat; see Figure 6-30. Unless there is a strong offshore wind or current, the boat will probably back parallel to the pier.

Figure 6-29 When backing on a forward quarter spring, the stern swings in but the bow swings out away from the pier.

Figure 6-30 By reversing on a bow line, a boat can be sprung in nearly parallel to a pier or wharf face.

## LANDING WITH CONTROL

Whenever you approach a pier or wharf, your close-quarters boat-handling skills will be tested. Although this maneuver is not difficult, a challenging situation can arise from a combination of wind, current, and adjacent congestion. Your knowledge of turning a boat in limited space will stand you in good stead when you tackle the problem of bringing your boat in neatly to a pier, wharf, or float.

As a matter of proper terminology, here is a reminder that you should not refer to a “dock” when you actually mean a “pier” or “wharf.” A pier projects out from the shoreline, usually but not always at a right angle. A wharf (sometimes called a quay, pronounced “key”) is a structure generally parallel to and not far from the shore. Technically, a dock is the adjacent water area that can be occupied by a vessel. In boating, however, the term is often used loosely to mean the structure itself. The space occupied by a vessel, or available for its use, is its berth.

The action of coming alongside the structure, whatever it is, is referred to as docking (sometimes mooring, although it is less confusing if this term is limited to picking up the pennant of a floating mooring buoy). Departing is “undocking,” a term more often used with ships than boats.

This section covers the basic guidelines to consider when approaching a pier or docking a boat in the types of conditions you will likely encounter.

### Approach with Caution

Since boats do not have brakes and must rely on reversing the propeller thrust to stop, it is prudent to maneuver at slow speeds in congested areas. Monitor your boat’s wake as you make your way to your berth; it can affect your boat as well as other craft nearby.

Don’t come in at high speed with a grand flourish. Depending on conditions, throttle down gradually to keep the boat under control. The goal is to proceed through the harbor or marina slowly, but with enough way on to maintain control. When you consider that you have enough way on to reach the dock, shift into neutral; use reverse power as and when necessary to check headway as you reach your desired location.

If your speed has been properly estimated, you will be several boat lengths from the pier when you shift into neutral. Approaching a pier too fast will require you to shift into neutral far from your berth. Even though the boat is moving through the water, the propeller is not turning and, consequently, there is no propeller discharge current acting on the rudder. Keep in mind that most boats have better slow-speed maneuverability if the propeller is turning: A slow approach allows you to keep the boat in forward until you are almost alongside the pier.

This is a good time to exercise judgment—keeping on the way needed for maneuverability, yet using no more speed than required. If you have been running at any speed, hold off briefly and let your own wake pass by your boat.

Have the dock lines ready to use fore and aft. Also have fenders ready so that they can be put in place as soon as the boat is secured, keeping it from chafing against piles or pier edges. Lead all docking lines outboard of stanchions and shrouds, so that they will be clear when taken ashore.

The biggest mistake novice deckhands make is to secure a dock line before the boat has lost all headway. If you have a couple of hands on board, assign one to the bow and one to the stern, with instructions not to make fast until headway is checked. Use reverse to stop the boat, cautioning your crew that securing the bow or stern lines while the boat is still moving can cause the bow or stern to come crashing into the pier. An after bow spring line is the only dock line that should be used to stop the boat. If you are maneuvering into a tight berth or against strong current or wind, this line will likely be the first one secured.

### Calm Conditions

Without wind or current to complicate landing, a skipper operating a boat with a single right-hand propeller should make a port-side approach to the pier. Time your approach speed so you will be several boat lengths from the pier when you shift into neutral. Since a reversing right-hand propeller will move the stern to port, approach the pier at a 10- to 20-degree angle; see Figure 6-31. When alongside, shift into reverse to stop headway. Depending on your speed, a short burst of throttle may be necessary to stop the boat and to kick the stern to port, with the boat alongside and parallel to the pier.

Figure 6-31 With a right-hand propeller, approach a pier or wharf for a landing, as at 1, at an angle of 10° to 20°. Discharge current of the reversing propeller will set the stern to port, as at position 2, even though the rudder is centered.

Although a port-side approach is preferable, you can, with care, make a good landing with the pier on the starboard side (remember, we are on board a single-screw boat with a right-hand propeller). Approach the pier slowly at a much shallower angle, as nearly parallel as possible to the pier; see Figure 6-32. Just before you have to reverse to check headway, turn the rudder to full left, swinging the stern in toward the pier. If it does not respond, give the propeller a brief spurt of ahead engine power while the rudder is full left, in order to kick the stern to starboard. Then reverse to check your headway.

Figure 6-32 When it is necessary to make a landing starboard-side to the pier in a craft with a right-hand propeller, approach slowly, as at 1, as nearly parallel as possible to the pier or wharf face. The rudder is turned to full left at 2, and the stern is swung to starboard with a short burst of engine power. Check the forward motion at position 3.

You can also bring the boat in parallel to the pier with an after bow spring line. Secure this line to a pile or cleat ashore, then put the gear in forward with the rudder full left. The spring line prevents forward movement while the stern moves toward the pier.

##### MAKING USE OF FENDERS

Fenders (they are not to be called “bumpers”) are relatively soft objects of rubberlike plastic often filled with air under low pressure. They are used between boats and piles, pier sides, and seawalls to protect topsides from scarring and to cushion any shock of the boat striking the fixed object. Some fenders can be inflated to different pressures with a hand- or power-driven pump. Most fenders are circular or square in cross section and of varying length.

Most fenders have eyes molded in each end for attaching a short length of line that is used to suspend them along the side of a boat. Some models have a hole through their center through which a piece of line is run and knotted on each side of the fender.

Good-quality fenders are not inexpensive, but they are well worth the investment. Half a dozen substantial fenders are not too many for the average cruiser to carry.

###### FENDERBOARDS

Vertically suspended fenders give protection against the face of a solid pier or wharf as the boat moves fore and aft. If the boat lies against vertical piles, however, vertical fenders will not stay in place during the boat’s forward and aftward movement.

The solution to protecting the hull in many situations is with fenderboards—short lengths (approximately 4 to 6 feet) of heavy boards (2 inches by 6 inches is common), sometimes faced on one side with metal rubstrips or rubber cushions. Holes are drilled, and lines attached, allowing the board to be hung horizontally, backed by two fenders hung vertically.

The horizontal fenderboard rests against the pile bridging the two fenders. The boat can then move back and forth the length of the fenderboard and still be protected from chafing against the pile.

Fenderboards also give excellent cushioning between two or more craft rafted together. One boat should put out the usual two fenders behind a fenderboard; the other puts over only its own two fenders. A second fenderboard should not be used, since one board could tangle with the other.

### Wind or Current Parallel to Berth

Because water is many times denser than air, in most cases current should be given primary consideration when planning an approach to a pier or wharf. If the wharf happens to be on the shore of a river or the bank of a tidal stream, the current will flow generally parallel to it. In this case, the direction of the current should determine how you approach. Heading into the current will enable you to keep the propeller turning over slowly and water moving past the rudder—right up to the moment of reaching the wharf—if the current is strong enough.

If you were to approach the pier from the opposite direction, moving with a half-knot current, you would not only have to stop the boat dead in water. You would also have to begin making half-knot sternway before your relative movement past the pier would stop.

The wind also must be reckoned with. Since propellers are not as efficient when reversing as when going forward, attempting to stop your boat in a strong following wind takes extra time. During this time, the rudder will be in the propeller’s suction current, so it will be of little use in steering the boat. Stopping a boat going upwind is much easier, and, if the wind is strong enough, the propeller can be kept turning ahead even as the boat comes dead in the water.

When approaching a pier with a current running or strong wind blowing parallel to it, stop your boat in the channel. Assess the directions and relative strengths of the wind and current (at times they may be opposing) before deciding on which approach is best:

• If the wind or current is at your back, then pass downwind or downstream of the pier, turn around and proceed toward the dock upstream. In starting a turn such as this, even at some distance from the berth, throttle down well before the wharf comes abeam. Otherwise your wake may carry along and have you wallowing in it just when you are coming alongside.

• In coming up against wind or current, you can use that force to check your headway, instead of reverse. In the case of a strong current, your boat should respond to the helm when its relative movement to the pier has stopped, because there will still be a flow of water past the boat and its rudder.

#### Landing Downwind or with Current

If you can, avoid any landing in which wind or current is setting you down toward your berth. Here, you are totally dependent on your reverse gear for stopping the boat. An error in judgment or an engine or gear failure would put you in an embarrassing, if not dangerous, situation.

Sometimes, however, space will not permit you to turn before docking. Suppose, for example, you are coming into a canal lock with a strong wind astern. Proceed in as slowly as possible while retaining control. With a single-screw, right-hand-propeller boat, if possible, choose the port side of the lock, so that your stern will swing in against the lock face when you reverse. Once the boat’s headway has been checked, get a line out from the stern or port quarter; the boat can lie temporarily on this line alone. If you get a bow line secured ashore first and miss making the stern line fast, you risk being turned end-for-end by the wind or current.

#### Handling the Lines

If you have a couple of hands aboard, assign one to the bow and one to the stern to handle lines, with instructions not to make fast until headway is checked. The seriousness of checking the boat’s way by means of a snubbed bow line instead of reversing the propeller is only too obvious. If single-handed, you will have to work smartly, with a stern line fast to the after cleat—coiled and ready to carry ashore—and a bow line run in advance along the deck back to the cockpit. All docking lines, of course, should be led outboard of stanchions and shrouds, to be clear when taken ashore.

The problem is similar if you are making your landing with a following current. In either case, be ready with reverse gear on the approach, using it as strongly as necessary to hold the boat against its momentum and the push of wind or current. The propeller ordinarily should be turning over slowly in reverse for the last boat length or two of headway, the throttle being opened gradually and as needed to kill all headway at the right instant.

### Landing on the Leeward Side of a Pier

Since the wind can blow from any direction, it’s not uncommon to find yourself approaching a pier with the wind blowing at right angles to the pier. If you have a choice as to which side of the pier you land, choose the leeward side. If the wind is strong, the windward side can be uncomfortable and your boat may pound against the piles. The rougher it is, the more important it becomes to dock on the leeward side. The wind will then hold the boat clear of the pier instead of pushing the craft against it.

Unless there is current to consider, make the leeward approach so the port side will rest against the pier. Depending on wind strength, you may have to point the bow into the wind a bit more than usual to keep it from falling away during your approach. Your biggest problem will be getting the stern to come into the pier against the wind.

Since you are going upwind, you can approach the pier a bit faster then normal, and then reverse a bit harder, kicking the stern toward the dock. You may need to put the rudder hard right and go forward for a short burst to help get the stern in.

Have the crew take or pass the bow line—or after bow spring line—ashore first. Then secure the stern line. If the stern begins to drift away from the pier before you can secure the stern line, run ahead on the bow line slowly with the rudder hard right. It will act as an after spring to help bring the stern into the pier.

Be careful that neither the bow nor topside is damaged by the pier during this operation; have your fenders ready.

If you have a large, heavy boat, secure the after spring on a beam cleat first; then secure the stern line.

Figure 6-33 Close-quarters boat handling is one of the most important skills that a boater can acquire. The key to success is understanding the fundamentals, plus much practice—an opportunity that is ever-present (often with other skippers watching) in most marinas and yacht clubs.

### Close Quarters

Often you will find that the only empty berth in a crowded marina or yacht club lies between two docked boats. There may be little more than a boat length to squeeze into; see Figure 6-34. Here again, the spring line comes into play.

Figure 6-34 Landing between boats A and B, boat C approaches at a greater than normal angle. At position C2, a spring line is run aft from at or near the bow to the pier or wharf. Going ahead with engine power and right rudder, the boat swings into its berth at position C3.

A port-side approach is preferable. Since boats are on both sides of your desired berth, you will have to approach at a greater angle than if the pier were clear of other vessels. The objective is to place the bow of your craft as close to the pier as possible, without running up on the forward boat. Be sure you leave ample clearance on your port side so that, when you back down to check headway, the stern does not hit the bow of the boat astern of you.

Have your crew stand by, ready to go ashore with the after bow spring line or ready to throw the line ashore to someone on the pier who will make it fast. After the spring line is secured ashore, put the rudder over full right and go ahead slowly. While the propeller discharge current acting on the right rudder pushes the stern into the pier, make certain that the spring line is adjusted so that the boat cannot possibly move forward into the boat ahead. Then, as the boat swings in, the spring line may be slacked off a little bit. Quite often you may find that a fender or two might be necessary at the point of contact.

#### A Mediterranean Moor

In some areas, especially along the Mediterranean coast in Europe, where docking space is very limited, boats of all types and sizes are docked with their sterns to the shore, without the use of piles and finger piers. An anchor is dropped off shore, and the vessel is slowly backed in, paying out the anchor rode, until it is close enough for persons to get on and off using a short gangplank from the transom to the quay or shore. Have fenders in place along both sides if there are adjacent craft.

### Holding with One Spring Line

The use of a spring line works well for temporarily holding a boat on the lee side of a pier or wharf. Assume that you intend to run up along the leeward side of a pier and remain there for a short time while you pick up guests or perhaps put someone ashore. Instead of getting lines out to make fast fore and aft as you would for a longer stay, or expecting the crew to hold the boat against the wind’s pressure, try using just one line as an after bow spring. First come alongside; pass and make fast the line ashore. Then, continuing to use it, go ahead, rudder turned away from shore, with just enough power to hold the boat in against the pier. This is a maneuver that you can accomplish single-handedly without too much difficulty, by having your spring line fast to the forward cleat as you come in, with the end ready to pass ashore for someone on the pier to drop over a pile or cleat.

#### Doubling a Spring Line

Single-handed, you might prefer to use the spring doubled, with a bight of line around the pile or cleat on shore and both ends of the line made fast to your boat. Then, when you are ready to leave, you can slip the engine into neutral, cast off one end, and haul the spring back aboard without leaving your boat. This would be helpful when the wind is of some force, the shoreside cleat well back from the pier’s edge, and there is no one on shore to assist. This way there would be no risk of the boat’s being blown off as you step ashore to cast off the line.

In any case, when the line has been cast off, the wind will cause the boat to drift clear of the dock, the bow ordinarily paying off faster than the stern. Whether you go ahead or reverse to get under way will depend on whether there are other structures and boats nearby, and whether your course is to be up- or downwind.

This same maneuver is appropriate if it is current rather than wind that is tending to move your boat away from the pier.

## CLEARING A BERTH

Getting safely away from alongside a pier or wharf can be either simple and easy or complex and difficult, depending on wind direction and force, the set and strength of any current, and the proximity of other craft. Take advantage of any help you can get from the wind and current, and make good use of spring lines.

### With Wind or Current Ahead

When your boat is facing the wind or current, leaving a berth is not difficult. The biggest problem skippers often create for themselves is to start forward without providing sufficient clearance between the pier and their boat. Remember that, for a boat to turn, the stern must be free to move. To pull away from a port-side pier, the stern must swing to port before the boat will begin to turn to starboard away from the pier. It is not uncommon to see a boat rub its stern against the whole length of a wharf as the skipper turns the wheel more and more to starboard in an effort to pull away; refer to Figure 6-15.

With smaller, lighter craft, all that may be needed to gain the necessary clearance from the pier is for someone ashore to push off the bow. Alternatively, backing on a forward quarter spring will allow the current to turn the bow away from the pier or wharf; use a fender to cushion the port quarter of the hull; see Figure 6-35. On the other hand, a larger boat will find it better to go ahead on an after bow spring, with the rudder turned in toward the pier. The natural action of the propeller plus rudder will swing the stern clear of the pier. You can then back down a short distance to clear the pier before going ahead; remember that as you turn to starboard your stern will swing to port, bringing it back toward the pier. With either procedure, don’t try to cut away too sharply; your stern could come back in enough that your port quarter would strike the pier.

Figure 6-35 One technique that can be used when the wind or current is ahead is to back on a forward quarter spring line with the rudder centered. This will turn the stern in and the bow out. You can then retrieve the spring line and power ahead to clear your berth. Use a fender as shown here.

### From a Windward Berth

Clearing a berth where the wind or current is pushing the boat against the pier does not necessarily have to be difficult, except in extreme conditions when it may be impossible to get the boat off the pier without working with the after bow spring.

Since the wind or current is holding the boat against the pier, cast off all dock lines except the after bow spring line. If the boat has only bow and stern lines, cast off the stern line, then transfer the bow line to an amidships position on the pier to convert it into an after spring.

Go ahead easy on the spring with the rudder turned toward the wharf; see Figure 6-36. The bow of the boat will come into the pier, and the stern will move away from the pier. If it does not respond with the rudder hard over, open the throttle to provide the kick necessary to work the stern around.

Figure 6-36 An after bow spring line is often needed to depart from the windward side of a pier or wharf face. The boat goes ahead on the spring from 1 to 2, with the rudder turned toward the shore. Use of a fender may be needed as shown here. At 3, the line is cast off, and the boat backs into the wind or current.

Depending on the nature of the pier and the type of boat, you may need a fender or two at critical spots between pier and boat.

Continue until the boat has turned enough. The stern should be angled far enough from the pier so it will not be blown back against the pier when backing away. Get the spring line and fenders on board, and back the boat away with rudder centered. The stronger the wind or current, the more power is necessary to move the boat against it. If there are other boats moored to the pier near you, back away with considerable power to gain sternway and some steerage as soon as possible.

Continue backing away until well clear; a boat that is dead in the water will make much more leeway than one that is moving.

### With Wind or Current Astern

Instead of merely casting off all lines and going ahead, get the maneuverable stern out away from the pier and go astern before going ahead on the course.

Run ahead on the after bow spring. This allows the stern to drift out into the current or be kicked out if necessary by power, going ahead with the rudder turned toward the wharf. If the current or wind is noticeable, often the stern swings out without aid of the engine. When the boat has swung out anywhere from 45 to 60 degrees, the spring is cast off. The boat should be backed off far enough to clear the structure before you go ahead with opposite rudder.

### Backing Around

We have already discussed backing out of a slip. But at times it may be necessary to back out of the slip and make an immediate sharp turn to avoid other boats or an adjacent pier. In either case, the forward quarter spring line can be used in much the same way as described for using the after spring; see Figure 6-37.

Figure 6-37 A forward quarter spring line can be used to assist a boat in backing out and around the end of a pier. When the spring line becomes taut, the boat reverses with full right rudder. Use a fender as necessary to protect the hull.

For example, let’s say your boat is lying in its slip, starboard side to the land. The first step is to make the spring ready from a point near the corner of the slip to the after cleat—either amidships, if there is only one, or the cleat on the starboard quarter, if there are two.

With the spring ready—slack but tended—ease off on the bow line, tended by someone on shore. Back the boat slowly with full right rudder. When the boat is about halfway out of the slip, take a strain on the spring to prevent backing farther. This will cause the boat to pivot as the stern is pulled around to starboard by the spring line. Be sure to protect the boat from the pier with a fender.

As you continue to back, the spring will pull the boat up to the pier. At this point, you should slack the spring as the boat comes parallel to the pier so you can back farther. If you plan to secure the boat to the pier, you can use the spring as one of your dock lines, adding others as needed.

This method is especially useful when there is a breeze off the structure that would tend to blow the boat away if maneuvering without lines. No human power is required, and it can be accomplished in a leisurely and seamanlike manner. But, as in any case where the stern is made fast to the shore with the bow free, take special care to keep the boat under control.

If the boat is to get underway after being backed around, no bow line is needed. When the boat has pivoted far enough, with its starboard quarter near the corner of the pier, idle the engine while casting off the shoreward end of the spring and bringing it on board. To get underway from such a position, keep the rudder amidships until the stern of the boat is clear of the pier.

### Turning in a Berth

At times you may find it easier to turn your boat around at the pier than to attempt to leave the berth with adverse current conditions—particularly if the area surrounding the pier is congested.

To turn a boat with the starboard side against a pier, current coming from astern, first let all lines go except the after bow spring. Often the effect of the current will then be sufficient to throw the bow in toward the pier and the stern out into the current; see Figure 6-38. If any factor, such as a beam wind, tends to keep the stern pinned against the pier, kick the stern out by going ahead easy with right rudder. Keep a fender handy as a protection for the starboard bow.

Figure 6-38 A boat can be turned end for end using just the current (or wind) and a spring line.

Take steps to prevent the bow from catching on the pier as it swings. A small boat will usually require a fender, but a large craft may have to reverse the engine just enough to keep the bow clear.

As it swings in with the current, the fender should be made ready near the port bow. Also transfer the after bow spring from the starboard side to the port side. If the boat does not come alongside readily, even when helped by going ahead a little on the spring line with right rudder, rig a forward quarter spring. Take a strain on the quarter spring and ease the bow spring. The current will push the boat back against this line and pull it parallel to the pier.

On a larger vessel, you will need to go ahead on the after bow spring rigged on the port side. Going ahead easily with right rudder on this spring alone, the boat stays under control and eases in nicely. In turning a boat this way, make the turn with the bow—not the stern—to to the pier.

### Turning with Power

Consider a situation as described above with the starboard side against a pier, except there is neither wind nor current to assist in turning. Here the power of the engine can be used to swing the boat. Go ahead on an after bow spring with right rudder. This throws the stern out away from the pier; use a fender to protect the bow. Allow the bow to nose up against the pier, using another fender, if necessary, to cushion it.

As the boat swings toward a position at right angles to the pier, ease the spring. With the bow against the pier, the engine going ahead slowly, and the rudder amidships, hold the boat in this position. Meanwhile, cast off the bow spring from on shore; rerig it as an after bow spring on the port side (or use a second line for the port side). With right rudder again, the stern will swing all the way around; shift the fenders once more to protect the port bow.

In any maneuver involving the use of engine power against a spring, the strain on the line must be taken up slowly and easily. A surge of power puts a shock load on deck fittings that they were never designed to carry, and may even tear out the cleats. And with such a surge, if the fastenings hold, the line may part.

Once the strain has been taken up easily, proper deck fittings and good line of adequate size will stand the application of plenty of power. Always bear this principle in mind when you are preparing to tow or when you are passing a line to a stranded boat. Also remember that most docking lines are nylon, and can store considerable energy as they stretch. When the boat is put in neutral or the throttle is closed, the boat can be pulled back toward the pier. If a nylon line is stretched to the breaking point, it can snap back with dangerous or even lethal effects.

##### TRIM TABS

The performance of a boat with a planing or semi-planing hull is considerably affected by its trim. A high bow-up angle of pitch results in less efficient operation and greater wake. The proper use of trim tabs will bring the bow down for a better running angle. These are metal plates usually attached by a hinge to a portion of the lower edge of the transom; see Figure 6-39. They look much the same as the flaps seen on the trailing edge of the wings of an aircraft. In the retracted, or “up,” position they are in line with the bottom of the craft. Moved to a “down” angle of 10 to 20 degrees, they provide added lift at the stern with a lowering of the pitch angle as the bow comes down. A slight increase in drag occurs, but this is acceptable for the desirable effect of a better running angle. Trim tabs are normally used in pairs, and are raised or lowered manually or by one or more actuators for each tab. Actuators are either small hydraulic cylinders and pistons operated by their own hydraulic pump or screw rods turned by electric motors.

Trim tabs must be used intelligently. When a boat is at rest in its berth, the tabs should be in the fully up position—this provides the maximum protection for the “piston rods” from marine fouling. Starting from a standstill, operating in the displacement mode, the tabs will have no effect and should be left in the up position. As additional throttle is applied to get “on plane,” the tabs should be lowered—how much will have to be learned from experience with each individual boat. Properly used, the tabs will significantly help the boat to get on plane, and will reduce the engine power required to stay on plane. Speed for a given engine rpm should be increased by several knots, and fuel efficiency should increase slightly. Once on plane, the best adjustment of the tabs will have to be found experimentally. Trim tabs are not always used with their maximum down angle; it is possible in some cases to get the bow angle down too low, with the result that the boat could tend to yaw from side to side. Most installations will have some sort of indicator for the angle of the tabs; they may be labeled “Tab Down” or “Bow Down”—the effects are exactly the same. Make small adjustments up or down, and after each, wait a half-minute or so for the boat to settle into the new running angle.

Trim tabs should not be used in all conditions. They probably should not be used in a following sea, as it is then desirable for the craft to have a greater bow-up attitude for more positive steering control. In significant head seas, the bow should be up more than in calmer waters, and thus less tab action is called for. Tabs should always be in the up position when backing down—if the tabs are down there will be water pressure on their upper surfaces that may damage the actuator.

A pair of trim tabs is normally operated together, the same angle on each tab. Controls for each tab are separate, however, and they can be adjusted individually. They can be so used to correct for a lateral imbalance, such as a list to port or starboard—an increased angle of tab is used on the low side.

## BOAT HANDLING WITH TWIN SCREWS

This chapter has thus far related almost exclusively to a single-screw inboard boat. Although this permits a better study of the basic factors of boat handling, attention must also be given to inboard engine twin-screw craft.

In twin-screw craft, there are twin rudders as well, one directly behind each propeller; see Figure 6-39. The propellers are counterrotating, which balances any steering pull, and will generally rotate “outward”—the right-hand rotation on the right side and the left-hand rotation on the left side. The effect of this is to provide maximum maneuverability.

Figure 6-39 Maximum maneuverability of twin-screw craft is gained by placing twin rudders behind the propellers, where the discharge current can act upon them most effectively. Note also the trim tabs (arrows) located at the lower edge of the transom.

Going ahead with the starboard engine for a turn to port, the offset of the propeller from the centerline adds greatly to its effect of throwing the stern to starboard. Similarly, offset of the port propeller helps the steering effect when the port engine is going ahead for a turn to starboard.

When reversing, the starboard propeller throws its discharge current against the starboard side of the hull to help a turn of the stern to port. Likewise, the port propeller reversing throws its stream against the port side of the hull to help a swing of the stern to starboard.

The important factors in turning and steering are thus combined by the outward-turning propellers. The steering effect is exerted in the same direction as the turning movement caused by the off-center location of the propellers.

### Gathering Headway

Unlike a boat with a single propeller, if the transmission gears of a twin-screw boat are put in forward together, the boat will begin to make headway without any tendency to pull to starboard or to port.

### Turning

Clearly, having two propellers gives you the means of shifting one propeller or the other ahead or astern, independent of rudder control. In fact, much of a twin-screw boat’s slow-speed maneuvering is done without touching the steering wheel; working the clutches and throttles is the key to controlling the boat’s movements.

#### One Propeller Going Ahead or Reversing

A boat’s stern may be put to one side or the other by going ahead or backing down one propeller, without turning the other. Some headway or sternway in these cases accompanies the turn.

Referring to Figure 6-40, powering ahead on the port engine (A) moves the stern to port and the bow to starboard; right rudder would assist this turn, but is not necessary. The opposite action, using power ahead on the starboard engine (B), has the opposite result, stern to starboard and bow to port.

Figure 6-40 These diagrams show the actions of a twin-screw craft when power is applied to only one propeller, with the rudder centered. (Arrows show discharge current). One propeller turning ahead turns the stern of the boat to its side. When one propeller is in reverse, the boat backs to the opposite side.

Reversing on one engine results in the same turning action as going ahead on the other. At (C), the port engine has been put in reverse, and at (D), the starboard engine has been reversed.

The maximum turning effect is, of course, obtained when one propeller is turning ahead and the other is in reverse—the two effects are additive; see Figure 6-41.

#### Maintaining Control while Backing

A twin-screw boat starting from a position dead in the water, with both engines at the same speed in reverse, has a great advantage over a single-screw craft, as it can be made to take any desired course by steering with the rudders. In such a boat, the counterrotation of the propellers means that the force that would throw a single-engine boat off-course is balanced out. Rudder action, however, will be less than when going ahead, as the propellers’ discharge currents are directed away from the rudders rather than onto them.

In addition to the ability to use the rudders, a twin-screw boat offers the possibility of using the throttles to speed up one engine or the other as an aid to steering while maintaining sternway. There is also the possibility of stopping one engine completely, or going ahead on it, for maximum control in backing up.

While a twin-screw craft backs as readily to starboard as to port, it is still subject to the effect of wind, waves, and current. The helmsman, however, has a greater ability to exercise control over these external forces.

### Steering with the Throttles

In maintaining a straight course with a twin-screw boat, the speed of each engine can be adjusted so that the leeward engine compensates for the effect of leeway. This is done by running the leeward engine at a slightly faster speed to hold the bow up into the wind. The disadvantage of using this technique is that an undesirable “beat note” or throb sound may be heard when the speeds of the two engines are not the same—when the engines are not “in sync.”

#### Turning in a Boat’s Length

With practice, you can easily turn a twin-screw boat in a circle only a little larger than the boat’s length, as shown in Figure 6-41. For example, to turn to starboard, the rudders can be set amidships while the port engine goes ahead and the starboard engine reverses; on most boats, turning the rudder is not necessary, but will tighten the turn.

Figure 6-41 A twin-screw boat can be turned in its own length. With rudders centered, go ahead on one engine with the other in reverse (small arrows show screw discharge current). Changing engine speed on one propeller can give the craft headway or sternway if this is desired.

Start this type of turn with the engines at idle or turning slowly at the same speed. To turn to the right, put the port gear in forward and the starboard gear in reverse. As the boat begins to turn, it may start to make some headway. (This is not surprising, since a boat drives forward more easily than it goes astern, and the propeller develops more thrust at a given rpm while turning ahead than astern because the propeller blades are curved so as to produce lift on the forward side.) To compensate, you probably will have to open the starboard throttle slightly to increase the rpm of the reversing starboard propeller. For both engines, a rate of rpm can be found so that the balance will turn the boat in its own length.

When the port engine is speeded up a little, the circle is larger and the boat makes some headway. If the port engine is slowed down, the circle is also larger, but the boat makes some sternway as the reversing starboard propeller pulls it around, stern to port.

##### STEP-BY-STEP DOCKING WITH A TWIN-SCREW BOAT

Most twin-screw boats are maneuvered in close quarters by using the direction of rotation of the propellers. Depending on wind or current conditions, stop the boat in front of the slip, or slightly to windward or up-current. (The rudder may be used if needed.)

The sequence below is intended as an example. Depending on the circumstances, this will sometimes be done in the opposite manner, swapping “starboard” for “port” and vice versa. In this example, both throttles are in idle as you back with starboard engine in reverse. As the boat gathers way, it will begin to back to port. By going forward with the port engine, the boat can be made to pivot and to align with the slip. When alignment is satisfactory, the port engine is also put in reverse to continue backing into the slip. Slight adjustment in direction can be made by putting either gear momentarily in neutral or forward. (On some craft, the placement and grouping of the shift lever and throttles will vary from that shown below.)

1 Stop headway with the starboard engine in reverse; the stern will begin to move to port. Then continue backing with the starboard and port engines at idle.

2 As sternway builds and you enter the slip, go ahead with the port engine to align the boat with the slip.

3 With the boat aligned with the slip, put both engines in reverse; continue backing into the slip. If either engine is put in forward, the stern will move in the same direction.

4 When fully in the slip, put both engines in forward momentarily to kill all sternway. Secure the boat.

#### Handling a Partially Disabled Boat

If your boat happens to sustain damage to the steering gear, it can still make port by steering with the throttles (provided that the rudders are not jammed hard over to one side). One engine can be allowed to turn at a constant speed—the starboard one, for example. Then open the throttle of the port engine to speed up the port propeller and cause a turn to starboard. Closing the throttle of the port engine slows down the port propeller and allows the starboard propeller to push ahead, causing a turn to port—keep your speed moderate when doing this, as steering is not as positive as with rudders. Since most slow-speed maneuvering is done with the propellers, when you get back to port you will be able to maneuver into your berth.

### Stopping

A twin-screw boat is stopped by reversing its propellers, but unlike a single-screw vessel, this will usually not throw the stern to one side.

### Docking a Twin-Screw Boat

When docking, the experienced helmsman of a single-screw boat usually tries to make a port-side approach so that, when the vessel is stopped, the reversing propeller will swing the stern toward the pier (or wharf). The skipper of a twin-screw boat can use this technique on both port and starboard approaches. By reversing the offshore engine to check headway when coming up parallel to the pier, the stern will move in. On a port-side approach the reversing starboard right-hand propeller will move the stern to port. When approaching to put the craft’s starboard side to the pier, the reversing port propeller will conveniently move the stern to starboard.

Landing at a pier or wharf, a twin-screw boat should approach at an angle of 10° to 20°, as is the case with a single-screw craft. When it has just enough way to carry it in nicely, the rudders are turned to the side away from the pier to bring the stern in as it comes up parallel to the structure, and the engines are shifted into neutral. To check headway as it comes parallel to the structure, the offshore engine is briefly put into reverse.

### Using Spring Lines with a Twin-Screw Boat

When a twin-screw boat is lying in a berth and a spring line is used to throw the bow or stern out as an aid to getting clear, one engine may be used. For example, with an after bow spring, going ahead on the outside engine only throws the stern out away from the pier; in addition, the inside engine could be put in reverse.

Sometimes a twin-screw vessel is gotten clear of a wharf by rigging a forward bow spring and reversing the propeller on the wharf side to throw the propeller discharge current on that side forward between the boat and structure as a “cushion.” Naturally this is most effective if the wharf under water is solidly bulkheaded rather than built on open piling. The discharge current from the inside wheel forces the boat away from the wharf, and the line is then cast off. Further reversing on the propeller nearest the wharf, while the other propeller turns ahead as necessary, shapes the boat up to get the stern clear. The rudders are left amidships until the boat is clear and ready to pull away.

### Other Twin-Screw Maneuvers

If one propeller is stopped while the boat has headway, the bow necessarily turns in the direction of the propeller that is dead. Consequently, if one engine of a twin-screw power plant fails, and the boat must proceed on the other alone, a certain amount of rudder angle on the side of the operating engine is necessary to maintain a straight course.

When a twin-screw boat has headway and a quick turn to starboard is desired, the starboard engine can be reversed and right rudder applied. The fact that the craft has headway means that the right rudder adds to the steering effect to shorten the turn.

With sternway, both propellers reversing, if a quick turn of the stern to port is wanted, the port engine is shifted to ahead and left rudder is applied. Again, due to the craft’s sternway, the rudders’ effect is added to that of the propellers to cause a quick turn to port.

If a twin-screw boat has considerable headway and its engines are reversed with rudders hard over, the stern will normally swing away from the rudders (to port with right rudder, and vice versa) until the headway is overcome by the reversing engines. After it has gathered sternway, the stern tends to work toward the side on which the rudders are set.

Caution: When shifting from forward to reverse or vice versa, remember to reduce the rpm’s to a minimum in order to protect the gears in the transmission.

## MANEUVERING WITH DIRECTED THRUST

Outboard, sterndrive, and pod-drive boats do not have rudders. The boat is steered by directing the propeller thrust—by turning the outboard motor, sterndrive, or pod unit on which the propeller is mounted. Maneuvering such a boat is usually easier than maneuvering a single-propeller inboard boat of the same type.

Directed propeller thrust makes slow-speed maneuvering easier and turns at normal speeds much sharper; see Figure 6-42. The propeller discharge current is turned from side to side to create turning forces, unlike a boat with a rudder, which must have water flowing by it to be effective. Outboard and sterndrive units have very little or no shaft angle, so the propeller does not produce as much unequal blade thrust as does the propeller on an inboard boat. Larger, more powerful outboard motors and high-power sterndrives do, however, produce considerable propeller torque—twin drives of either type normally have right-hand and left-hand propellers to balance out this undesirable effect.

Figure 6-42 The pivoting drive unit of a sterndrive boat (left) permits a tight turn, while an inboard craft, even a twin-screw boat (right), with its fixed propellers, responds only to the rudders. Jet-drive craft can likewise make very sharp turns at high speeds, even to the point of being dangerous.

How a particular outboard or sterndrive boat reacts to the helm is difficult to predict exactly, but some general principles apply in most situations. Some of these situations—basic maneuvers that any boater will likely have to complete during regular daily operation—are described next. This discussion assumes a typical boat with single outboard or sterndrive power. Boats with two outboards or sterndrives can usually be maneuvered as described above for twin-inboard vessels.

### Gathering Headway

When an outboard or sterndrive boat is “dead in the water”—that is, not moving forward or sternward—and the propeller is not turning, the boat will not respond to the helm. Since the propeller is not turning, it is not creating any discharge current, so no turning forces are created. Even though the boat may be moving over the bottom with a current, no water is passing by the lower unit of the outboard or sterndrive; therefore, it cannot act as a rudder.

As soon as the outboard or sterndrive is shifted into forward gear, the propeller’s action creates a discharge current and generates thrust. If the outboard or sterndrive is centered, the discharge current is directed straight back, causing the boat to begin to move forward in a straight line.

If you open the throttle quickly on a boat with a single large outboard or sterndrive, as you would when pulling a water-skier, for instance, torque will pull the stern of the boat to one side, usually starboard, similar to a single-screw inboard. Large outboards and some sterndrives have small trim tabs located behind the propeller that help compensate for these forces, but a firm grip on the helm before the throttle is opened is also necessary.

As the boat gathers headway and the propeller begins to operate in the faster water flow for which it was designed, this imbalance usually lessens. If your boat wants to turn to port or starboard as soon as you let go of the helm at typical operating speeds, the steering trim tab needs adjustment.

### Turning

After a boat has gathered headway, with the helm amidships and the lower unit tilted so that the boat is planing at a slight bow-up angle, the average boat tends to hold its course in a straight line fairly well. Once underway, the outboard or sterndrive boat is not affected to any significant degree by propwalk unless the lower unit is trimmed too far out or in.

If the helm is turned to starboard, the outboard motor or sterndrive is also turned in the same direction. The propeller’s discharge current is directed to starboard, forcing the stern to port. Water flowing past the hull hits the lower unit on its starboard side, creating additional turning forces. The stern begins to move to port, causing the bow to turn to starboard.

If the helm is turned to the left, the motor or sterndrive turns to port; the stern of the boat moves starboard as the bow begins to turn to port.

At low speeds, there can be a time lag between when the helm is put over and when the boat begins to turn. At high speeds, there is little lag in helm response. Small movements of the helm result in immediate action by the boat. The faster the boat moves through the water, the greater the forces generated by the water hitting the lower unit of the outboard or sterndrive, which provides a small amount of “rudder action.” Also, the discharge current increases in strength as the throttle is advanced and propeller rpm increases.

It is important to remember that the response of each boat depends on the maneuver and the speed at which it is undertaken. Actual experience at the helm at different speeds is the only way to become familiar with the handling characteristics of any boat.

In order for the boat to begin its turn, the stern must be free to move. For example, the force of a water-skier towline secured to the stern can make steering difficult, since it may prevent the stern from swinging to port. That is why competition ski boats secure the line to a towing post located well up into the boat, forward of the transom; refer to Figure 6-16.

##### STEP-BY-STEP DOCKING WITH A STERNDRIVE BOAT

Outboard- or inboard/outboard-powered boats are relatively easy to back up, but that may be scant comfort to the novice in a busy marina. The reversing propeller is turned in the direction you want to go by using the wheel or motor handle or tiller. On some light displacement boats with shallow draft, the bow tends to be influenced by the wind (coming from the left in the photos below).

When backing down in a crosswind, allow maneuvering room (to port in this example) and watch the bow carefully. If it begins to swing downwind, you may have to stop backing, leave the helm over to port (toward the wind) and go in forward to straighten the boat. A quick burst of power is all that is usually needed, but be careful that you don’t throw your crew or guests off balance with a sudden maneuver.

Set your speed to just enough to overcome the effect of a crosswind. If this doesn’t work, abort the maneuver early, reposition, and wait for a lull in the wind.

1 Bring the boat to a stop by shifting into reverse. Put the helm over to port and begin backing in. Slow your speed by momentarily shifting into neutral.

2 Continue backing with the helm over hard to port. Watch the bow, and begin to straighten the helm as the boat enters the slip.

3 Center the helm to align the boat parallel to the pier. If the stern is too far from the pier, shift to neutral, then put the helm over to port and go forward for a second or two.

4 When fully in the slip, stop sternway by shifting into forward. Put the helm to port to kick the stern over close to the pier if necessary. Shift into neutral and secure the boat.

### Stopping

Unlike a car with brakes, your boat depends on reverse thrust in order to stop. Assume that the boat has headway, with the helm centered and the propeller turning in reverse. Now the propeller discharge current is directed forward, past the lower unit of the sterndrive or outboard.

Depending on the throttle setting, the screw current may not be strong enough to reverse the water flowing past the lower unit. As power is increased, the propeller discharge current becomes strong enough to stop the flow of water past the lower unit and, as the throttle is opened, more completely reverses its flow.

While water is flowing past the lower unit, there is some steering force generated, but when the discharge current stops that water flow, the boat will temporarily not respond to the helm. When the strong propeller discharge current starts to flow past the lower unit, steering is again restored. In addition to the force of the water hitting the lower unit, the propeller discharge current is directed by turning the outboard or sterndrive, adding to the steering forces.

The propwalk of the reversing propeller tends to throw the stern to port, but to a lesser extent than a comparable inboard engine craft.

### Backing Down

If your boat is dead in the water with the outboard motor or sterndrive centered, and you put it into reverse gear, the stern will be pushed slightly to port by the reversing propeller. The tendency to back to port can easily be overcome by turning the engine or sterndrive slightly to starboard.

Since outboards and sterndrive boats have the advantage of directing the propeller discharge current, and need not rely on a rudder for steerage, you can also maneuver your boat by the judicious use of the throttle. The technique is to position the drive unit with the steering wheel while out of gear or at very low speed, then to give a short, sharp burst of throttle. The overall effect will be to push the stern in the desired direction while not adding an appreciable forward or sternward motion to the boat.

As the boat begins to gather sternway, the water passing by the lower unit will begin to contribute to the steering force. Unlike most single-screw inboard boats, outboard and sterndrive boats back predictably. If the helm is put over to starboard, the motor or sterndrive will turn to starboard and will direct the propeller discharge current to port, moving the stern to starboard.

However, wind and current will affect how a boat of this type backs. Outboard- and sterndrive-powered boats tend to be light-displacement, shallow-draft craft, and when backing down in a strong crosswind, the bow will tend to fall off downwind. This can cause steering difficulties.

Remember that, in addition to the force of the wind on the forward topsides, the hull’s pivot point has also moved aft, much closer to the drive unit. The steering forces are now acting on a much shorter lever as a result.

Usually, once sufficient sternway is gained, the force of the keel moving through the water is enough to keep the boat on track. Also remember that, when backing, the stern will lead as it moves to port or starboard, before the boat begins to turn.

### Jet Drives

Jet-drive boats essentially have a propeller within the hull of the craft—in effect, this is a pump drawing in water from ahead and ejecting it out the stern. There is no rudder—steering is accomplished by pivoting the jet nozzle from side to side of the centerline. Reversing is done by lowering a deflection plate or reversing buckets into the discharged water so as to create rearward thrust.

The vast majority of jet drives will be found on personal watercraft (PWCs), but jet drives have been used on vessels of all sizes, including yachts of 100 feet (30.5 m) or more in length.

The use of jet drives on small, fast personal watercraft provides a high degree of maneuverability and fast acceleration. Steering response is immediate, and turns can be very sharp. Persons taking their first ride on a PWC should start out slowly and get the feel of the craft’s response to throttle and steering before operating at high speed and making sharp maneuvers.

Figure 6-43 The Volvo IPS drive differs from a conventional inboard-outboard drive unit—the propeller faces forward to pull, rather than push, the boat through the water. The entire unit can turn from side to side for steering, but the maximum angle of turn is limited for the sake of safety. The IPS drive is designed to break off cleanly if an obstruction is hit, thus lessening the likelihood of hull damage.

##### OTHER SEAMANSHIP TOPICS

Although boat handling is one of the major aspects of seamanship, there are many others.

These include Anchoring (Chapter 9), Special Techniques (Chapter 10), Safety & Emergencies (Chapters 11 and 12), River Seamanship (Chapter 22), and Marlinespike Seamanship (Chapter 23).

Seamanship for sailing craft is covered in Chapter 8.

### Pod Drives

A new form of directed-thrust propulsion, similar to the pods used on large ships (see this page), has become popular in recent years for recreational vessels and yachts. The first of these new pod drives was the Volvo Penta Inboard Performance System (IPS), followed by Cummins MerCruiser Diesel’s Zeus system. The main difference between them was that the twin counterrotating IPS propellers face forward to pull the boat through the water, while the Zeus System utilizes aft-facing propellers, also counterrotating, to push the boat.

Pod-drive engines are mounted far aft in the boat, freeing up interior space where a midships engine room would otherwise be, and they drive the pods, mounted under the boat, via a vertical shaft through the bottom of the hull. Cooling water intake and exhaust are both included in the pod, reducing the need for through-hull fittings in the boat. And the pods are designed to shear off cleanly in case of a catastrophic grounding, eliminating the possibility of a strut or rudder piercing the hull.

The advantages of pod drives are numerous. Since each pod turns independently from side to side, together they add up to tremendous maneuverability at low speeds for docking; at higher speeds, they give the boat a sharp turning ability. They also provide better fuel efficiency and less smoke and noise than do traditional inboard engines.

The pleasures of recreational boating are not in any way related to the size of one’s craft, although it is true that size has a real bearing on the type of boating activities that can be accomplished. Whereas there are elements of seamanship that apply to every boat, there are significant differences between the requirements for small, open outboard or sterndrive craft and larger inboard-powered cruisers and sport-fishing boats.

This chapter focuses on smaller craft, up to 26 feet (7.9 m) long—boats that are generally suited for trailering. These are the U.S. Coast Guard categories of Classes A and 1—about 96 percent of all the boats in the United States.

## THE BOAT

Outboard boats, those craft suitable for a detachable motor, come in a wide range of sizes, designs, construction materials, and costs. At the lower end are the 8-foot (2.4-m) or smaller prams that can be car-topped or used as a dinghy. At the upper end of the scale are the center-console and cruiser hulls that can take two, three, or even four motors of as much as 300 or more horsepower (hp). And there are many sizes and styles between these extremes.

Also at the upper end of this size range are boats with sterndrives that combine the desirable qualities of an inboard engine with the flexibility of a drive unit generally similar to the lower unit of an outboard motor.

### The Use of the Boat

The key to selecting the “right” boat for a particular skipper is the use, or uses, for which the craft is intended. Obviously, the boat for waterskiing is not the boat for trolling, and the boat for an afternoon outing may not be the perfect one for a week’s cruise. Not all boating families will agree on just one or even two uses, and few families can afford a separate craft for each activity desired.

Compromise is inevitable, but if all possible factors are considered in advance, the likelihood of disappointment is reduced. Be sure to take into consideration the type of waters on which the boat will be used—protected lakes and rivers, coastal bays, or offshore.

### Hull Designs

There are two basic hull types—displacement and planing—and many variations of the latter. Although, in general, displacement boats cruise through the water and planing hulls lift and skim over the surface, often it is difficult to make a sharp distinction between these types.

Planing hulls receive a large part of their support at planing speeds from the dynamic reaction of water against the bottom, and a lesser part of their support from buoyancy, which diminishes with increased speed but never quite disappears at any speed. With today’s availability of motors with high horsepower, most cruisers have some planing action, and practically all runabouts are of the planing type.

Small boats designed to take outboard or sterndrive power can be classified into the following hull forms:

• Flat bottom (displacement type) Usually rowboats or skiffs 10 to 18 feet (3 to 5.5 m); used for fishing, hunting, or utility purposes on shallow streams and small protected lakes. These include the ubiquitous jon boats, roomy and stable, often made of aluminum. Though any flat-bottom boat will plane with enough engine power, it will give you a bone-jarring, even dangerous ride on anything but flat water. These boats are intended to operate in displacement mode with oars or small outboard motors. Stable and roomy enough to stand in while fishing or duck hunting, and able to float in mere inches of water, they are valued for their utility in sheltered water.

• Round bottom (displacement type) Dinghies, tenders, car-top boats, occasionally runabouts 12 to 18 feet (3.7 to 5.5 m). At slow speeds these hulls are often more easily driven and maneuvered than the flat-bottom craft. (Some light round-bottom boats will also plane.)

• V bottom The most popular type of hull design, the V bottom is used for runabouts, utility craft, and cruisers when planing speeds are desired. All V-bottom hulls incorporate flat underwater surfaces that develop dynamic lift for planing as the boat speeds up. In contrast with flat-bottom boats, however, the flat surfaces of a V-bottom boat are given deadrise (see Chapter 1), which means that they slope upward from keel to waterline when viewed in cross section and thus can cut through waves rather than pounding over them. There are many V-bottom varieties, including:

Shallow–V hulls have little deadrise—sometimes almost none. Popular on the U.S. West Coast, this type has virtues, but rough-water comfort isn’t one of them. The trihull (or cathedral) is a V bottom with two smaller V shapes on each side of the hull. The deep V uses deadrise at the transom ranging from 22° to 24° (see Chapter 1, this page). The modified V has a deep V forward that tapers off to a shallow V in the stern, and has a hard or soft chine. This is the most popular competition-ski-boat construction type. Twin-hull catamarans are increasing in popularity because of the stable platform they offer.

• Hydroplanes Generally used for racing. The bottom, which is flat, may be “stepped”—that is, divided into two or more levels about halfway between bow and stern. The resultant notch reduces wetted surface, increasing speed.

### Size & Loading

Because overloading a small boat can be exceedingly dangerous, the safe limits for a particular boat must be known. Coast Guard rules require that U.S. boats under 20 feet (6.1 m) (except sailboats and some special types) manufactured after October 31, 1972, carry a “capacity plate” showing maximum allowable loads. Since August 1980, plates for outboard boats have shown a maximum horsepower for motor(s), maximum number of persons, and maximum weights for persons only and for motor, gear, and persons together; see Figure 7-02. Plates for inboard, sterndrive, and nonpowered vessels omit the maximum power rating.

Figure 7-02 For an outboard craft, a U.S. Coast Guard capacity plate shows the maximum horsepower as well as passenger number and weight limits and total maximum weight for persons, motor, and gear.

### Added Buoyancy

Boats less than 20 feet (6.1 m) in length manufactured since July 31, 1973, carry built-in flotation installed in accordance with U.S. Coast Guard regulations (the exceptions, again, being sailboats and some special types). It is possible to add positive flotation to older boats to ensure the safety of yourself and your passengers. This can be in the form of sealed air chambers or masses of plastic foam.

The buoyancy units should be located as high as possible in the hull so that the boat, if swamped, will remain in an upright position and not capsize. This provides greater safety than a capsized hull; persons in the water will be able to hold on easily, and they may be able to recover some form of emergency signaling, bailing, or other needed equipment.

### Special Design Features

A highly desirable safety feature is a self-bailing motor well. Most boats powered with an outboard motor have a transom that is “cut down,” or lowered, where the motor is to be attached. This is necessary so that the motor will be low enough that its propeller will be well below the bottom of the hull. Though it improves the efficiency of the motor, a cut-down transom creates a vulnerable low point through which following seas could swamp the boat from astern. Safety can be maintained by placing an inner bulkhead forward of the motor that is not cut down, one that is fully as high as the sides of the boat; see Figure 7-03. The space aft of this bulkhead to the cut-down transom is the motor well; it should have self-bailing drains at each after corner.

Figure 7-03 On the craft shown here, the motor is mounted on a cut-down portion of the transom, but there is a full-height bulkhead forward of the motor. This design allows the motor to be at an optimum height with respect to the hull without increasing the danger of water entering the boat from astern.

Many boats will have special features for particular applications, such as sport fishing. These invariably add to the cost of the boat and are justified only if the craft is to be used for such special purpose.

## THE MOTOR & ITS ACCESSORIES

Trailerable boats are typically powered by outboard motors or inboard-outboard power packages (I/O, also called sterndrives). For information on maintaining an engine, see Chapter 21. This chapter focuses on how to choose an outboard or sterndrive engine and propeller and how to operate the engine safely.

### Outboard Motors

An outboard motor is a detachable powerplant, complete with driveshaft and propeller, that operates on one to eight cylinders; see Figure 7-04. The fuel tank and operating controls are usually separate; on the smallest motors, they may be mounted on the powerhead itself. Although usually a gasoline-fueled motor (two-stroke or four-stroke operation), it may be electric for trolling or other low-power applications. The only two-stroke outboards being built today utilize electronically controlled high-pressure direct injection (HPDI) to satisfy emission regulations. However, there are hundreds of thousands of older conventional two-stroke engines still giving satisfactory service around the country and the world.

Figure 7-04 A two-stroke outboard motor provides a higher horsepower-to-weight ratio than an inboard engine or a four-stroke outboard. The use of computer-controlled fuel delivery systems and automatic oil injection enables new two-stroke outboards to comply with all emission standards.

The outboard is clamped or bolted to a cutout in the transom or mounted on a bracket bolted to the transom. Smaller motors are clamped on for easy removal; medium and larger motors are bolted on, and removal is possible but infrequent. The motor can be tilted into or out of the water, either by hand for smaller units or, on larger units, with the help of hydraulics. The smallest outboards are generally steered by a hand-held tiller. The medium size range has wheel-controlled steering with push-pull cables; larger units will be assisted hydraulically (some with power steering). In recent years, every outboard builder has added joystick control to larger engines, with independent vectoring for precise slow-speed handling around docks and slips.

### Sterndrives

A sterndrive pairs a four-stroke gasoline or diesel engine mounted inside the hull with an externally mounted drive unit that resembles the lower section of an outboard motor; see Figure 7-05. This combines the greater power and efficiency of an inboard engine with the directed-thrust steering, tilt-up capability, and other advantages of outboard propulsion.

Figure 7-05 A sterndrive propulsion package, also called an inboard/outboard, combines a typical medium-size inboard gasoline or diesel engine with an external drive unit (also called an outdrive) that is very similar to the lower unit of an outboard motor.

Sterndrive boats are similar in size and design to medium and larger outboard boats, handle similarly, are used for the same general purposes, and can be trailered.

### Outboard vs. Sterndrive

Two-stroke outboards offer trailerboaters a much higher horsepower-to-weight ratio than sterndrives can provide. Two-stroke outboard motors are built of lightweight cast aluminum and pull more horsepower out of smaller-displacement blocks. For example, a 115-hp sterndrive cast-iron engine that has 181 cu. in. (3.0 L) of displacement might weigh 625 pounds (283 kg), while a 115-hp two-stroke outboard with 105 cu. in. (1.7 L) displacement, built by the same manufacturer, weighs in at 315 pounds (143 kg), about half the weight for the same power. (Motors of all types are now also rated in metric units; 1 hp = 0.746 kW.) Four-stroke outboard engines are usually somewhat heavier than two-strokes and may be available at somewhat higher maximum power ratings.

Outboard motor wells use up valuable cockpit space. However, if the boat is designed for it, an outboard “bracket” can be attached to the boat’s full transom, placing the motor or motors outside the boat. Putting the motor a couple of feet aft of the transom places the propeller in “cleaner” water, allowing it a better “grip.” Brackets are generally used with large outboard motors and boats in the 20- to 30-foot (6.1 to 9.1 m) range. Brackets can prove particularly useful for twin-motor installations and are most popular in 24- to 28-foot (7.3 to 8.5 m) offshore-style fishing boats, where increased cockpit space is appreciated but twin engines are desired.

Four-stroke outboards continue to advance, getting smaller in size and lighter while producing more horsepower. In recent years Seven Marine developed V-8 outboards of 527, 577, and 627 horsepower. These engines with closed-loop cooling systems weigh 1,094 pounds, which, though heavy, is only about 100 pounds heavier than a typical 350-horsepower four-stroke.

Electronic “fly-by-wire” outboard-engine controls replace the traditional mechanical controls with digital data, allowing a single wiring harness to serve multiple engines or additional helm stations. Digital controls provide smooth and positive shifting and precise throttle response even at low speeds; they eliminate the often-heard “clunk” of an outboard engine gear engaging. They also need less maintenance than the old cables, which can corrode, and the helmsman can adjust the throttle friction levels to his or her preference.

Sterndrive engines offer the greater fuel efficiency of four-stroke engines and the convenience of inboard-engine accessibility, but they do use up interior space. Sterndrives are suitable when a boater wants the convenience of an outboard (a drive leg that tilts out for servicing, prop maintenance, or shallow-water operation and helps the boat reach optimum trim) and the appearance of an inboard, with the engine hidden inside the boat. Some sterndrive manufacturers offer a drive with two counter-rotating props on a single shaft. This reduces torque, keeping the steering straight, and adds to overall engine performance and efficiency. It also eliminates propwalk and enables the helmsman to back in a straight line.

MerCruiser and Volvo Penta offer twin-engine gasoline sterndrives in which the two drives are independently articulating, and each drive has twin counterrotating propellers. The drives are controlled with a joystick for fingertip docking and low-speed operation. The turning of the drive legs enables the boat to move from side to side or in any direction and describe a complete circle within its own length. The system uses digital throttle and shift controls and electronic/hydraulic steering for ease of operation.

Although most sterndrives are in the 100- to 450-horsepower range, Mercury Racing has introduced the most powerful sterndrive yet, a 1,350-hp all-aluminum, turbocharged V-8 engine with 32 valves and 552 cubic inches of displacement.

### Outboard Motor Selection

While horsepower always seems to be the first consideration of motor selection, other factors, such as weight, starting method, and price, may be even more important. With the wide range of motors available, it is not difficult to select a model suitable for almost any application.

The horsepower required for a boat will depend upon the size, weight, and hull design of the boat and the desired speed. A displacement hull of 14 feet (4.3 m) or so will serve adequately for lake and river fishing with a 10-horsepower motor; any greater horsepower would be wasted in an attempt to drive the boat faster than it is designed to go.

For waterskiing behind a planing hull of 16 to 18 feet (4.9 to 5.5 m), motors of 40 to 75 horsepower are suitable. A larger outboard will make the boat go faster, provided the hull can handle the larger engine, but speed does not increase in direct proportion to motor power. Very roughly, horsepower must be tripled or even quadrupled to double boat speed.

##### ENGINE CYCLES

Internal-combustion engines—gasoline or diesel, land or marine, inboard or outboard—operate on cycles consisting of several strokes. A stroke is one travel of the piston in the cylinder, up or down. (Customary usage is to call inboard powerplants on boats “engines” and outboard powerplants “motors,” but there is no real difference in the two terms.)

The majority of engines operate on a cycle of four strokes and are usually referred to as four- stroke engines, although the term “four-cycle” is occasionally used. The cycle is normally considered to start with the intake stroke—this is a downward movement of the piston resulting in a partial vacuum in the combustion chamber and an inflow of air or a mixture of air and fuel through one or more intake valves. Next is the compression stroke—an upward movement of the piston, reducing the volume of the combustion cham-ber and increasing the pressure and temperature of the air or mixture, called the charge. In a gasoline-fueled engine, when a piston reaches the top of the cylinder, a precisely timed electrical spark results in the rapid burning (not explosion) of the fuel-plus-air mixture. In a diesel engine, the compression ratio (the ratio of the volume in the cylinder when the piston is all the way down to the volume when it is all the way up) is greater than in a gasoline engine. Only air is compressed; fuel is injected at or near the top of the piston’s travel. There is no spark, the initiation of burning being caused by the very high temperature of the highly com-pressed air. Once the fuel is ignited by spark or compression, the rapid burning of the air and fuel generates a large amount of combustion gases (sometimes called “products of combustion”), the expansion of which forces the piston down in the power stroke. After completing this stroke, the piston again moves upward in the exhaust stroke, forcing out the expanded gases through the exhaust valve, which has been opened for this purpose; the cycle is then complete. (In some engines, there may be more than one of each type of valve. In fuel-injection gasoline engines, fuel may be injected into the cylinder as in a diesel engine, but a spark is still needed to ignite the charge as the compression ratio is less.)

Power is generated by the engine on only one of the four strokes and on only one of each two revolutions of the crankshaft. For each cylinder, the other three strokes are carried through by power strokes in other cylinders and/or the momentum of a flywheel

Another type of engine has only two strokes in each cycle; this type of operation is termed two-stroke cycle, commonly called two-stroke (or sometimes “two-cycle” as in the designation of outboard motor oil as TC-3W, where “TC” stands for two-cycle and “W” for water-cooled). The inflow of air and fuel and the outflow of exhaust gases are through openings in the cylinder walls; there are no valves as in four-stroke engines. These ports are closed off by the sides of the piston for most of each stroke, opening at different times in the upward and downward movement of the piston. Near the bottom of the downward stroke, the exhaust port is uncovered and the remaining pressure in the combustion chamber forces out the burnt gases. The intake port opens slightly before the exhaust port (on the opposite side of the cylinder wall) is covered; the incoming charge, under slight pressure, helps in pushing the burned gases out, but in so doing, some of the unburned fuel of the new charge goes out also, increasing the pollution. Each downward power stroke of the piston serves to slightly increase the pressure in the crankcase so that, when an intake port is uncovered shortly after the exhaust port is uncovered, a fresh charge of fuel and air will flow into the combustion chamber to be compressed on the subsequent upward stroke. When the piston nears the top of its travel, a spark ignites the charge and the cycle repeats.

The advantages of a two-stroke outboard engine are the simplicity and weight savings conferred by the absence of valves and a less-complicated lubrication system. A two-stroke engine is also more powerful because it generates one power stroke for every engine revolution instead of every two revolutions as in a four-stroke engine. The historic disadvantages of a two-stroke motor—the need to manually mix oil with the fuel (now required only in very small, “portable” motors) and the “dirty” smoky exhaust caused by incomplete combustion of fuel—have been greatly diminished by the design changes made to comply with emission regulations. In addition, today’s two-stroke motors are as quiet and free of vibration as most four-stroke motors.

#### Two-Stroke or Four-Stroke?

From their commercial introduction in 1909, outboard motors were almost universally two-stroke cycle designs. The two-stroke cycle provided a number of advantages: lower manufacturing cost, lighter weight (there are no complex intake and exhaust valve systems), and more power per cubic inch of cylinder displacement. The disadvantages of the basic two-stroke cycle include the need to mix lubricating oil with the fuel, difficulties in starting and sustained low-speed running, and the presence of unburned fuel and oil in the exhaust. While the introduction of automatic oil injection systems, electronic ignitions, and electric starters made two-stroke motors easier to use, they could not equal four-stroke motors in smoothness of low-speed operation, and they continued to have “dirty” exhaust.

A limited range of four-stroke outboards was introduced in the U.S. in 1973. Although heavier and more expensive than two-stroke motors, they did not require the addition of oil to the gasoline, were easy to start, idled smoothly, ran quietly, and were much more fuel-efficient. Available in a relatively modest horsepower range, they slowly gained market share but remained a small part of the outboard motor market.

The enactment of federal limits on exhaust emissions meant that all outboards would have to comply with progressively stricter emission standards. Engine manufacturers reacted positively by developing new two-stroke motors that would comply with the new limits and simultaneously developing lighter and more powerful four-stroke motors. Today, two-stroke outboard motors are available with power ratings from 2 to 300 horsepower, though most are less than 250 horsepower. Four-stroke outboards are available with power ratings as high as 627 horsepower, though most are less than 350 horsepower. Some of the motors use carburetors; others, low- or high-pressure direct-to-cylinder fuel injection. Some motors are equipped with mechanically driven superchargers, others use pulse-tuned induction and exhaust systems to achieve high power output per cubic inch of displacement.

There are disadvantages to fuel-injection systems. They are usually more costly than a carburetor and require more complex engine control systems. Maintenance, when required, must be performed by technicians equipped with and trained to use specialized test equipment.

Four-stroke outboard motors have many design features in common with automobile engines. There are intake and exhaust valves for each cylinder, and fuel is injected. Oil (designated as outboard motor oil FC-W) is not mixed into the fuel flow but is stored separately and applied by a pump for lubricating the crankshaft, connecting rods, cylinder walls, and other parts of the engine.

Two-stroke motors continue to provide a weight advantage when compared with four-stroke models of the same horsepower. In the “portable” motor category, up to about 25 horsepower, the two-stroke motor can be as much as 50 pounds lighter than a four-stroke motor of equal power. Two-stroke motors in the 300 horsepower range can be 35% lighter than comparable four-stroke motors, a weight difference of more than 270 pounds. Again, the only two-stroke motors being manufactured today utilize electronically controlled high-pressure direct-injection (HPDI) technology.

#### Small Gasoline and Electric Motors

Very small single-cylinder gasoline outboards, ranging from 2-hp models that weigh under 25 pounds (11.3 kg) to 4- and 5-hp motors of 45 pounds (20.4 kg) or less, offer inexpensive, reliable power for dinghies, small inflatables, and small sailboats. Most of these outboards are simple, with integral gas tanks, 360° steering (allowing you to reverse by spinning the entire engine), and no transmission.

Even smaller 12-volt electric motors, in various sizes rated in pounds of thrust, are bow-mounted on small fishing boats as auxiliary motors to pull them along at trolling speeds. These motors are quiet and usually rigged for remote control, with the operator controlling the motor with his feet while using his hands to do his fishing; see Figure 7-06.

Figure 7-06 For fishing in protected waters, a boat will often have a high-horsepower motor for a speedy run to the fishing area, plus a bow-mounted electric motor for quietly moving around to the various spots where the fish might be.

Several electric outboard motors are available for the main propulsion power of smaller, slower boats. These are of limited horsepower and are used in specialized applications, such as where no engine emissions are permitted. The motors are quite light but require several hundred pounds of batteries. (There are also small craft with inboard electric motor/battery propulsion.)

#### Electric Starting

Most small outboard motors are started by pulling a rope that is wound around the top of the flywheel. This is not practical for larger motors, so electric starting systems are provided. The electrical system, with its battery and alternator, has the added bonus of making possible the use of navigation lights and electronic gear on the boat.

Electric starting means added weight and cost, but this is offset by the greater convenience. In general, motors less than about 9 hp will be manually started; those of more than 25 hp will have electric starting; motors between these sizes may have either method, though starting a 25-hp motor with a pull cord is a challenge.

#### Single-, Twin-, or Multiple-Motor Installation

Many outboard hulls are designed to allow the fitting of two or more motors on the transom. There are definite advantages and disadvantages to each arrangement, given the same total horsepower.

The most common reason for twin motors rather than a single one is the added safety that such an installation provides; see Figure 7-07. Properly maintained outboard motors are extremely reliable, but if one should fail, the other will bring the boat home. Disadvantages of the twin rig include the greater initial cost, an additional battery (or larger single one), more complex control systems, greater weight in the boat (about 60 to 75 percent more), greater underwater drag, and greater fuel consumption (not doubled, but greater by about 50 percent). Twin motors, and their batteries and fuel tanks, take up more space than that needed for a single-motor installation. The standard practice in any twin-engine installation is to mount a right-handed prop on the starboard engine and a left-handed prop (see below) on the port engine in order to balance out strong torque effects; see Figure 7-08.

Figure 7-07 Twin or multiple outboard motors give a greater degree of security from loss of power. The disadvantage is higher initial investment compared with the cost of a single motor of the same total horsepower, plus more weight and greater fuel consumption.

Figure 7-08 This multi-purpose open-deck, 25-foot catamaran-type boat has twin high-horsepower outboard motors. The greater beam of this type of hull provides greater stability for fishing and cruising and a wider spacing for the motors, increasing maneuverability.

A special case is the large outboard cruiser that needs two motors to meet horsepower requirements and has no stringent weight or space requirements. In such an installation, twin motors will also allow the use of more efficient propellers with larger blade area.

If a boat is performing to certain standards with a single motor, what will result if a second motor of the same power is added (assuming the boat is rated to handle the doubled horsepower)? The added weight and drag, combined with hydrodynamic factors, will hold the speed increase to about 25 percent, although this will vary widely with specific installations. Fuel consumption with both engines running at the same rpm (revolutions per minute) will be about 1½ times that of the single-motor installation.

A combination to be considered is a single large motor adequate for all normal operation, plus a smaller motor of 4 to 10 hp. The smaller motor is used for trolling while fishing—large motors should not be run at slow speeds for extended periods—and for emergency backup; see Figure 7-09. A 6-hp motor will move a medium-size outboard hull at 3 to 4 knots and get it home or to assistance.

Figure 7-09 Because large motors are not optimally efficient when run at slow speeds for long periods of time, some skippers choose to mount a second, small motor that will push the boat at a trolling speed. Such a motor can also bring the craft home should the large motor fail.

### Propellers

Although most outboard motors are sold with a “stock” propeller suitable for an average boat under average conditions, some motors, especially larger ones, are offered with a choice of several propellers. Keep in mind that a stock propeller may not have the optimum diameter or pitch, or both, for a particular application. Your first step should be to become familiar with the basic parts of a propeller; see Figure 7-10.

Figure 7-10 An understanding of propellers should start with knowledge of the basic parts. The propeller shown here is typical, but there are some design differences in other models.

Manufacturers publish tables of recommended propeller sizes for various applications, but these should be used only as initial guides. If you know another owner who has an identical boat and motor combination, whose style of boating matches yours, and who is getting the desired performance from his craft, your decision may be easy.

Otherwise, the answer lies in experimentation. In any case, the “right” propeller for any boat in a specific application is the one that allows the motor to turn up to its full rated rpm, but no more. It is necessary for the motor to turn to full rated rpm in order to develop its full rated power. However, if it will turn faster than that, the propeller is too small and full power is not being developed at the rated maximum rpm (which must never be exceeded).

Ideally, a propeller should be matched not just to the motor but to the boat and the use to which it will be put. In reality, the propeller that comes with a boat is often a compromise. If this is true of your boat—if your engine is not turning up to its rated speed, for example—you can improve your boat’s performance by fitting a more appropriate prop.

As a spare propeller is an excellent safety item, the purchase of a more efficient one is not all “added expense”—the stock propeller becomes the spare.

#### Diameter & Pitch

Diameter is defined as the distance across the circle made by the blade tips as the propeller rotates; see Figure 7-11. The proper size is determined by the rpm at which the propeller will be turning, as well as the amount of power delivered through it. Note that diameter will need to be greater as horsepower increases and as rpm decreases. Diameter will tend also to be larger as propeller blade surface increases.

Figure 7-11 Diameter is the distance across the circle that the blade tips trace as they revolve; note that for a three-bladed propeller it is not a tip-to-tip measurement. Pitch is the distance that a propeller would advance in one revolution in a solid substance, as a screw would advance in wood. Shown here are two propellers of different diameter and pitch.

The pitch of a propeller determines its “bite” on the water, and thus the rpm that the motor can turn up (this is also affected by propeller diameter). Motor rpm is related to boat speed and weight—a faster boat will use a propeller of greater pitch than a vessel that is designed for slower operation. Experimentation is really the only way of selecting the best match of propeller to suit the craft. Propellers are available whose pitch can be adjusted over a moderate range.

A propeller is described by stating its diameter and pitch, usually in inches—for instance, the lower propeller in Figure 7-11 with a 16-inch diameter and a pitch of 13 inches would be described as “16 by 13,” typically written as “16 x 13”; it would also be designated as “right-hand” or “left-hand” (see this page).

If a single motor is “doubled up” with another similar to it, this will require a change of propeller on the original motor. The faster speed obtained with the additional horsepower will call for a greater pitch—probably one but possibly two inches more, but only trials will tell for sure.

#### Materials

Most stock propellers on outboards and sterndrives are made of aluminum. These are well suited for a conventional purpose and are also relatively easy to repair. Propellers of stainless steel and other high-strength alloys are advantageous for special applications such as waterskiing and racing. They are more durable, but also more expensive to purchase and repair. Plastic is used mainly for propellers of small motors such as those for electric trolling and on dinghies.

#### Shear Pins & Slip Clutches

Because outboard boats often operate in fairly shallow water, the drive shaft, gears, and other internal parts of the motor are subject to damage should the propeller hit an underwater object. To prevent such damage, the motors are equipped with either a shear pin (older small motors only) or a slip clutch (all current models) on the propeller shaft.

A shear pin is made of a relatively soft metal. It transmits the drive from the propeller shaft to the propeller, and is just strong enough for this. Upon impact with a rock or other hard object by a propeller blade, this pin is broken, sheared off near the end, and the impact is not transferred to the inner parts of the motor; be sure to carry spare pins.

To overcome the nuisance of having to replace sheared pins, manufacturers developed slip clutches in which a rubber inner hub is used to transmit the drive power. Under normal loads there is no slippage, but upon impact with a hard object, the rubber hub slips somewhat to absorb the strain from the propeller blade.

Some propellers are constructed with removable blades so that one or two damaged blades can be replaced; carrying extra blades rather than an extra propeller can save space, weight, and money.

##### PROPELLER TYPES

Propellers are classified according to their construction, materials, and design. Six types are generally available, four of which are shown below.

• The aluminum propeller can be run fully submerged or slightly surfaced with light loads. Some have special blades to avoid becoming fouled with weeds in shallow-water operation.

• High reverse thrust is useful for workboats, large slower boats, and auxiliary sail-power applications. The blades provide the same thrust in forward or reverse.

• The cleaver-style surfacing propeller has the trailing edge of its blades cut on a straight line. This is a true high-rev racing performer designed for surface-piercing sterndrives and outboard applications. It provides less bow lift than the chopper.

• The chopper style, another surfacing propeller, is for sport boaters for speeds higher than 50 mph. It has considerable bow-lifting capabilities and is known for the tenacious way in which it refuses to break loose on a plane, a much-desired characteristic. It comes with weed-chopping fingers.

• A basic stainless-steel propeller is similar in design to the conventional propeller of aluminum, but it has slightly thinner blades and higher strength and durability for a wide variety of medium- to high-horsepower applications. It is also resistant to corrosion in salt water.

• Stainless-steel high-performance or racing propellers are of the cleaver type with a higher pitch range because of the combination of high horsepower and lightweight boats. Speeds are in the 90 mph range.

## EQUIPMENT

From the moment it is launched, each boat—even the smallest, including personal watercraft (PWCs)—must meet all federal requirements for a craft of its size and type of use (refer to Chapter 3), plus any additional equipment required by state or local regulations. Boaters venturing into new waters subject to other regulations than at home should check with a marina operator, park ranger, or other local authority to avoid inadvertent violations. The prudent traveler will find out about any further local requirements, such as anchoring limitations, special cruising permits, speed limitations, etc.

#### Navigation Lights

Even if you intend never to use your boat at night, it should be equipped with navigation lights (refer to Chapter 4). Engine trouble, fuel problems, unexpectedly good fishing, or other situations may keep you out longer than planned. (PWCs are not operated at night and thus are not expected to have navigation lights.)

Power-driven vessels less than 12 m (39.4 feet) in length have the option under both the Inland and International Navigation Rules of carrying a single all-round white light, visible two miles, in lieu of separate forward and stern lights. This light may be placed off the fore-and-aft centerline if centerline mounting is not practicable. Under the International Rules only, if such a light is shown, the sidelights must be combined in one light that is carried on the fore-and-aft centerline or located as nearly as practicable on the same fore-and-aft line as the all-round light.

Nearly all outboard boats are therefore delivered with a red-green combination light at the bow and an all-round white light aft. All too often, however, the after light is not high enough to meet the requirement for all-round visibility, especially when the boat is underway and the bow rises, or when a canvas top is used. Some lights are on a telescoping pole so that they may be lowered for convenience when not in use during the daytime, and to protect the mounting from damage; see Figure 7-12. Even when raised, these lights are usually too low to be seen from ahead. Be sure that your boat can be seen from all directions when underway at night; the white light is more important than the colored lights, as it will be seen at a greater distance. Have someone on shore or on another boat check as you run past at various angles, and then let your boat go dead in the water to check the after light as an anchor light.

Figure 7-12 A stern light may be mounted on a telescoping pole so that it can be kept low and out of the way during the day. When operating at night, be sure to extend the staff to full height so that the light will be visible from all directions. See Chapter 4 for all details regarding navigation lights.

Under the International Rules only, a power-driven vessel that is less than 7 m (23 feet) in length and whose maximum speed does not exceed 7 knots—typically a lightly powered dinghy—may show only an all-round white light that is visible for two miles. Sidelights are not mandatory but should be shown if practicable.

Under both International and Inland Rules, a vessel less than 7 m (23 feet) long and propelled solely by sail or oars need have only a flashlight handy to show a white light in sufficient time to avoid a collision. Dinghy owners take note.

### Equipment for Safety

Equipment for safety and convenience was covered in Chapter 3; some items will be covered again here with special emphasis on their applicability to smaller craft.

#### Lifesaving Devices

Smaller boats, especially those with outboard motors, are more likely to capsize or sink than are larger inboard boats; consequently, there is a greater possibility that the occupants will find themselves in the water. Do not skimp on personal flotation devices; carry at least the number legally required (see Chapter 3, this page). Wearable PFDs of the proper size are required for each person on board. (Additionally, a throwable PFD, such as an approved cushion, is required on each craft over 16 feet [4.9 m] in length.) Adult nonswimmers, handicapped persons, anyone wearing a cast, and children should wear a PFD at all times when underway. (There are legal requirements regarding children in most jurisdictions.) Special-purpose flotation devices approved by the U.S. Coast Guard, such as some hunter’s jackets and some waterskiing vests, are legally acceptable; many waterskiers wear a belt rather than a jacket, but this does not count toward the required number of life jackets onboard.

#### Paddle or Oars

Required by regulations in some state and local jurisdictions (and by plain common sense everywhere), a paddle or pair of oars should be on all smaller boats. They could be the only way of reaching safety in the event of motor failure. Most outboard boats row or paddle quite clumsily and with considerable effort, but the means to do so should be on board; see Figure 7-13.

Figure 7-13 No matter how dependable a motor may seem, a paddle or pair of oars should be carried on all small boats for emergencies.

#### Anchor & Line

Another item of common sense, and in some areas, boating regulations, is a suitable anchor and line long enough to anchor in all areas where the boat is used; see Figure 7-14. (Obviously, this concept must be applied with reason when the boat is used off very deep coasts, but when purchasing line it is better to get too much than too little.) See Chapter 9 for details on anchoring.

Figure 7-14 An anchor and line are required by some states but not by federal regulations. In any case, however, it is a good safety practice to have a means of anchoring in an emergency, such as an engine failure. A short length of chain between the anchor and line is desirable (see Chapter 9).

#### Bailer

All small boats should be equipped with a manual bailer. This can be a scoop purchased for this purpose or one homemade from a household plastic jug. Transom drains are effective underway for many fast boats, but these must have a means of positive closure when not in use. Electric bilge pumps will be found on many larger outboard or sterndrive boats. A large sponge is frequently convenient for getting that last little bit of water out of a small boat.

#### Flashlight or Lantern

Every small boat should be equipped with a flashlight or electric lantern, whether or not plans include using the boat after dark. The light should be waterproof, and it should float if accidentally dropped overboard. Extra batteries, stored in a waterproof container, will often prove valuable in an emergency. All in-use and spare batteries should be renewed at the start of each boating season, regardless of their apparent condition. The flashlight is also important while traveling on the road in case of trailer or car trouble.

#### Visual Distress Signals

All boats 16 feet (4.9 m) or more in length operating in coastal waters or wide connecting bodies must carry a specified minimum of visual distress signals; smaller boats need carry them only when operating at night. The signals must be U.S. Coast Guard approved; signals are classified for day or night use or a combination of both. Common sense suggests carrying more than the legal minimum. See this page for details.

#### Radio

A radio is often installed when the outboard motor has a battery for electric starting and an alternator to keep the battery charged. A VHF radio with its smaller antenna is especially suitable for smaller boats. Small handheld VHF sets (refer to Chapter 20) are useful in outboard boats, especially if used with an installed antenna.

### Operational Equipment

In addition to equipment carried on board for safety reasons, there are many items that will be needed or useful in the normal operation of smaller boats. The specific items will, of course, vary with the size of the craft and the uses to which it is put.

#### Compass

Except when used on the smallest of lakes, no outboard or similar boat should be without a magnetic compass. Select one of adequate size and quality, and install it properly. Refer to Chapter 13 for more information.

As most smaller boats are relatively open, it is particularly important that the compass is shielded from the sun’s direct rays. When not in use, remove it and store it out of the light or place a cover over it.

#### Charts

Carry charts for the waters you use; on inland lakes and rivers, these may be called “maps”; refer to Chapter 15. Learn to use a chart with your compass, and do use it often under favorable conditions even when not strictly necessary. This practice is excellent training and will prepare you for using the chart with confidence and efficiency should an emergency arise. Make a point of keeping track of where you are at all times.

#### Tools

Every boat, no matter how small, should carry at least a few simple hand tools. The minimum should be a screwdriver, pliers, and an adjustable open-end wrench. Consideration might be given to having two or more screwdrivers as well as wrenches of various sizes. A spark-plug wrench suitable for your motor is recommended.

#### Safety Chain

Most outboard motors are clamped to the craft’s transom (some of the larger ones may be through-bolted). To protect against accidental loss overboard should the clamps loosen with vibration, a short safety chain (or cable) is often used between a connecting point on the motor and a ring securely fastened to the hull. Chains or lengths of steel cable, frequently plastic-coated to reduce rusting, may be inexpensively purchased for this purpose already equipped with snap fittings at each end. This is cheap insurance against the loss of an expensive motor in deep water. With locking fittings, they also guard against theft.

#### Extra Fuel Tanks

The very smallest outboard motors have an integral fuel tank, but those of four or more horsepower typically operate from remote tanks that are more convenient with their larger capacity. Boats 18 feet (5.5 m) or so in length, with high-horsepower motors, usually have built-in tanks.

It is often necessary to carry additional fuel to make long runs without stopping. Spare tanks are discussed on this page.

#### Steering & Other Controls

The simplest outboard motors have controls right on the motor itself; see Figure 7-15. A steering handle, or tiller, is used to turn the motor from side to side. A throttle may be built into the steering arm or it may be a separate lever on the motor. A gearshift lever for forward, neutral, and reverse is usually located on the side of the powerhead. Controls for choking and carburetor-jet adjustment are usually on the front of the motor.

Figure 7-15 On smaller motors, all controls are typically mounted on the powerhead. On the motor shown here, the shift lever is on the side of the steering arm, just behind the throttle twist grip.

Remote steering and engine controls may be an option on motors of about 10 to 25 hp, and are standard on larger engines. This allows the operator to sit forward in the boat for greater visibility, with a wheel for steering and levers for throttle and gearshift control. A control also may be provided to change the angle of the engine against the transom to adjust the riding trim of the boat (see this page).

Steering controls may consist of a continuous loop of metal cable (usually plastic-covered) running from one side of the engine forward, around a drum on the shaft of the steering wheel, and then aft to the other side of the motor. Pulleys are used to guide the cable, which may run forward on one side of the boat and aft on the other, or may run fore and aft on the same side.

Rod steering uses a rack-and-pinion gear at the steering wheel to push and pull a stiff cable through a protective housing. The other end of the cable is attached to the motor, moving it from side to side around its central pivot as the steering wheel is turned back and forth. Rod steering gives smooth control and is free of the hazards of the exposed cables of the other type.

In hydraulic systems, steering-wheel motion is transmitted through fluid-filled lines to the stern, activating a push-pull rod attached to the motor or motors.

Throttle and gearshift controls consist of a stiff cable within a sheath to transmit the back-and-forth motion required. In some models, the two controls are combined at the helm in a single lever that is pushed forward to go ahead and pulled backward, through a neutral center position, to go astern. This mechanism is somewhat more complex than separate throttle and gearshift controls.

#### Tachometer

This instrument, when properly calibrated, indicates engine revolutions per minute (rpm). A tachometer is important when running trials to select the optimum propeller, and it often is used as a reference for operating at cruising or trolling speeds. In the absence of a speedometer, a series of timed runs at regular increments of engine speed can be used to establish a speed curve for the boat. This curve then gives you a boat speed through the water at any engine setting. See Chapter 16, this page, for details on establishing a speed curve.

An electronic tachometer can be fitted to almost any outboard motor; it is a simple job requiring little technical know-how and very little time.

#### Speedometer

As an alternative to developing a speed curve with a series of timed runs, a speedometer can be installed, and speed taken directly from it. This instrument also is quick and simple to install, and the more expensive models offer a reasonable degree of accuracy. Many models can be calibrated by doing a series of timed runs, but even if a speedometer is not accurate in absolute terms, it can be used to determine the relative speeds obtained with various motor and propeller combinations. Calibration is necessary, however, when it is to be used in navigation. Onboard speedometers measure only speed through the water, not over the bottom as a GPS receiver does.

#### Electronic Depth Sounder

Many smaller craft can carry an electronic depth sounder and put it to good use. Special transom mounts for the transducer are available for smaller craft where through-hull mounting may not be practicable.

### Boat Covers

A cover keeps dirt out of the boat and helps to protect the interior between periods of use and during off-season storage; see Figure 7-16. Usually of Dacron or similar synthetic fabric, covers may be available in a style that covers your entire boat, from stem to stern, including the outboard motor; others may cover only the open parts of the boat. Covers are excellent for keeping out rain as well as the dirt and leaves that accumulate when the boat is on its trailer. Be sure that the cover provides adequate ventilation for the interior to prevent rot of interior woodwork, and other forms of fungus growth.

Figure 7-16 A well-fitted cover will prevent rain and falling debris from entering the boat in its berth afloat or ashore or while traveling. The entire boat or only its open portion may be covered; the motor may or may not be covered.

The cover must fit the boat and must be capable of being adequately secured by means of snaps or drawstring. (Snaps or other mechanical fasteners should be protected from corrosion by a non-staining lubricant; a silicone grease stick is excellent for this purpose.) A cover is of great value when a boat is being trailered, but it must be fastened down adequately to prevent wind damage. In outdoor storage, a cover must also be adequately supported internally to prevent the formation of pools of rainwater that will stretch and eventually tear it, dumping the water into the boat.

For some small boats, tops are available to provide protection against rain and shade from the hot sun while the boat is in operation. Side and rear panels, with clear plastic inserts, also may be available, offering considerable protection against rain and spray, as well as allowing comfortable boating in cool weather; see Figure 7-17. Such tops and panels should be removed before trailering a boat at highway speeds.

Figure 7-17 The addition of a top, often with side and rear panels including clear plastic, can make a boat more comfortable in rainy or cool weather. Often such a craft can be used for weekend cruises or other short trips.

### Registration & Numbering

Although requirements vary in details for various states, nearly all boats, including personal watercraft, will require registration and the affixing of numbers on each bow; refer to Chapter 2.

## OUTBOARD MOTOR USE

A boat equipped with an outboard motor or inboard/outboard drive can be used for widely varied recreational purposes, some of which include fishing, waterskiing, cruising, and diving. In any application, greater safety and enjoyment will result when you understand and employ the following boating practices.

### Adjusting the Motor

Begin your outboarding by installing the motor properly on the boat, according to the manufacturer’s diagrams. Seat a single motor squarely on the center of the boat’s transom and securely tighten the bracket screws. Some motors come equipped with a special mounting plate; with others, you may want to make use of a rubber pad to help cushion vibrations and to prevent the transom from being marred. Be sure to connect a safety chain or cable from the motor to the boat’s hull; a lock may be desirable for security against theft.

Twin motors are usually installed by a dealer, as are large single motors of the high-horsepower range. Twin motors should have the proper separation—22 inches (56 cm) is recommended by the American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC) for motors up to 75 hp, and 32 inches (81 cm) for higher-horsepower motors on single-hull craft. Standard motor position dimensions are furnished to the boat manufacturers; see Figure 7-18. Motors on catamarans are normally placed at the stern of each hull; this wider spacing is an advantage in maneuvering.

Figure 7-18 Standards are set by the American Boat and Yacht Council for the width of transom cutouts (A above) and for the center-to-center spacing of twin outboard motors (B). The ABYC standard also includes other critical dimensions.

If a combination of a large and small motor is used, the large one is mounted on the boat’s centerline, with the small “kicker” off to one side, usually on a bracket specifically designed for such use. (Such a bracket allows the motor to be raised entirely clear of the water when not in use, thereby reducing drag.) The low horsepower of the small motor will not present any significant steering problems from its off-center position.

### Motor Height

Although there is a high degree of standardization in the design of transom cutouts for motor mounting, it is wise to check that the lower unit of the motor is correctly located with respect to the bottom of the hull. Standard shaft lengths are 15 and 20 inches (38 and 51 cm), and 25 inches (64 cm) for high-horsepower engines. There are variations, however, and a transom can be modified, if necessary, to ensure proper motor positioning. The anti-cavitation plate on the lower unit (see this page) should line up with the transom chine, except for some installations on deep-V hulls.

If the motor is located too high, a smooth flow of water will not reach the propeller; it will not get a proper “grip” on the water. This may cause “ventilation,” in which the propeller spins in aerated water with possible damage to the engine from excessive rpm. If the motor is located too low, drag will be increased due to the greater area of the lower unit in the water and a distorted flow over and under the anti-cavitation plate. Attention to this detail of motor installation will help provide increased speed and decreased fuel consumption.

### Thrust-Line Adjustment

Most outboard motors are equipped with a tilt adjustment, allowing a boater to vary the angle of thrust of the propeller. For best performance, the drive of the propeller should be in a line parallel to the flat surface of the water at the boat’s most efficient operating angle, whether as a planing hull or in the displacement mode.

If the motor is in too close to the transom, the thrust line is downward from the horizontal, pushing the stern up and the bow down, making the boat “plow” through the water unnecessarily. On the other hand, if the motor is tilted too far out from the transom, the thrust line is upward, and the bow is forced up too high while the stern “squats”; see Figure 7-19.

Figure 7-19 The trim of the lower unit has a significant effect on the planing angle of the boat, which alters top speed and handling. At A, the drive is trimmed too far “in,” while at B it is too far “out.” The drive at C is properly trimmed.

Boats differ in design, and loading conditions vary widely with any specific boat, so manufacturers make tilt-angle adjustment as easy as possible. On sterndrive engines and some larger outboard motors, an electro-hydraulic control is provided; just push the button for “up” or “down.”

Be aware of the inefficiency of an improper thrust angle, and do not neglect to change the adjustment to your current operating conditions. The best angle may vary with water conditions. On some boats, an adjustment with the motor tilted out (bow up) for smooth water may give more speed. A better ride in rough water may be obtained with the motor trimmed in a bit. Remember that only with actual trials on your boat will you be able to tell for sure.

### Special Applications of Tilt

While underway, the tilt feature of outboard motor and sterndrive lower units can be used to advantage for several special situations. If the propeller becomes fouled with weeds, it is, for example, often a simple matter to stop the motor, tilt it up, clear off the vegetation, lower the motor, restart it, and then continue on your way. If a smaller motor shears its pin, it is often possible to replace it with the motor tilted up, making it unnecessary to remove the motor completely in order to work on it in the boat.

It is also possible to tilt the outboard motor or lower unit up far enough so the boat can clear shoal areas. Take care not to tilt it so much that the cooling water intake comes above the surface, and watch out that the propeller does not strike rocks or other hard objects that might damage it. Proceed slowly when using this technique.

With I/Os, many manufacturers recommend not to operate with the drive unit partially or all the way up. Otherwise, you risk excessive wear on the flexible couplings.

### Mixture Controls

Many smaller outboard motors have controls for adjusting the fuel-to-air ratio; see Figure 7-20. This adjustment allows you to obtain optimum performance while cruising at low speeds and, in the case of some smaller motors, for high speeds as well. Adjustment controls are located outside the motor cover so that they can be used easily while underway.

Figure 7-20 Smaller outboard motors have one or more carburetor controls brought out to the front of the motor case to make possible the adjustment of fuel-to-air mixtures for various operating conditions. Be sure to follow the instructions in your operator’s manual.

You can minimize the possibility of engine damage due to improper settings and help achieve the best results by strictly following the instructions in your owner’s manual.

Changes in fuel, air temperature, and altitude (such as going from mountain lakes to a lower elevation or vice versa) may require changes in mixtures. Any adjustment should be made with the motor thoroughly warmed up and the boat loaded to normal trim. Many motors also have a manual choke control for a richer mixture of fuel and air for starting.

### Fuels & Oils

The drive for a cleaner environment has resulted in the mandated use of “no lead” gasoline with other chemicals added to maintain octane ratings. In many cases these fuels have given older motors a few problems. The effects of ethanol-containing gasoline on marine inboard and outboard engines and tanks are discussed in Chapter 21, this page.

A two-stroke outboard motor has its lubricating oil mixed into the gasoline fuel supply; there is no separate crankcase. Consequently, special oil properties such as “low ash” are required, and many normal features such as detergents must be limited or avoided.

The best oil to use in a two-stroke motor is one specifically made and sold for that purpose by oil companies or outboard manufacturers. The oil will be certified as TC-W (two-cycle, water-cooled) and it will contain no harmful compounds. Take note that although the motor manufacturers do not make the oils that bear their names, presumably they set the specifications for them. Using oil from the motor’s manufacturer will ensure greater compatibility between the oil and motor (and possibly lessen any difficulties with warranty claims).

The current TC-W specification is now TC-W3; this addresses the higher horsepower engines. It meets even more demanding specifications in order to cope with the now-common use of low-grade “pipeline” gasolines. It can be used in any size motor. (TC-W and TC-W2 oils are no longer produced and sold.)

Outboard motors are generally of low compression ratio and can use fuels of modest octane rating. Actually these engines now are designed for these fuels (many boaters find it desirable to use mid-grade 89 octane gasoline). Keep in mind that marine engines normally operate under a constant load, unlike autos and trucks that go uphill and downhill, with frequent changes of load. It is always best to follow the fuel recommendations in your owner’s manual. Remember, with the newer four-stroke outboards, no fuel/oil mixture is required. But with two-stroke outboard motors using a mixture of gasoline and lubricating oil, it is essential that both of these be of the correct type and that the mixture ratio be that specified by the manufacturer.

### Oil/Fuel Mixture Ratios

Motor manufacturers specify the correct ratio of gasoline to oil for their models. Although for older motors the ratio was 24 to 1, for most motors today it is 50 to 1. Motors made outside the U.S. may have different requirements. The amount of oil to be used is sometimes given as ounces or fractions of a pint that should be added for each gallon of gasoline; see Table 7-1.

Table 7-1 The row for 48:1 is commonly used for a 50 to 1 mix, and the row for 96:1 when a 100 to 1 mix is specified (1 pint = 0.47 L; 1 gallon = 3.8 L).

Some marinas now have a special pump installed that dispenses premixed gas and oil. In some instances this mixture is fixed at an established blend, usually at a 50 to 1 ratio; however, at other pumps, controls can be set to any one of several standard gas/oil ratios.

Many outboard motors are now oil injected, providing an optimum ratio for any speed. This is especially valuable for the higher horsepower sizes, enabling them to be used at the lower end of their speed range without fouling the motor; see Figure 7-21.

Figure 7-21 An oil-injection system will automatically mix oil and fuel to the precise operating ratio between 50 to 1 and 100 to 1. It reduces oil consumption at idle speeds to reduce smoke and pollution. The oil reservoir is about the size of a battery box and can hold enough oil to treat at least 150 gallons (568 liters) of gasoline.

### Fueling Procedures

There are two aspects of fueling an outboard boat that must be given careful attention—safety and the proper mixing of the oil and gasoline. Fueling a boat safely is an essential element of good seamanship. Whether you are planning a day’s outing or an extended cruise, before starting out make sure you have enough fuel on board, and if any is needed, fill your tanks safely. Refer to Chapter 11 for information about the safety aspects of fueling.

Tanks of smaller than 6 gallons (23 L) should be removed from the boat when refueling; see Figure 7-22. Newer outboard motor oils make filling portable tanks easy because they mix readily with gasoline. Use the engine manufacturer’s recommendations to determine the amount of oil for the required amount of fuel. Pour the oil into the tank, and then fill it with gasoline. The inward flow of the fuel will cause the oil to mix thoroughly and additional mixing is not needed. (If the tank is empty—dry—it is best to fill it about one-quarter full of gasoline before pouring in the oil.) Shaking the tank is not necessary. Wipe off the outside of the tank and return it to the boat after any odor of fumes has disappeared.

Figure 7-22 As a safety measure, portable fuel tanks should be removed from a boat and filled on the gas pier or wharf. Wipe the tank clean and dry before putting it back on board.

For safety, portable tanks should be secured in the boat. A simple way is to provide wooden blocks on the hull or floorboards to prevent sideways or endways movement of the tank, with straps over the top of the tank to hold it down in rough going.

If your fuel tanks are larger than 6 gallons (23 L), they are best left in the boat for filling. These, and permanently installed tanks, are not filled until all doors, hatches, windows, etc. have been closed to keep any gasoline vapors from getting below. After fueling and cleaning up, open all hatches and ports, and allow time for ventilation to clear bilges and any enclosed spaces before starting the engine.

Pour oil into the fill pipe of a fixed tank before it is filled with gasoline. Fuel flow will carry the oil into the tank where the newer outboard motor oils mix rapidly. Most higher horsepower engines now have separate gasoline and lubricant tanks that eliminate mixing oil into the fuel. Lubricant is automatically mixed with the fuel in metered amounts. This results in lower oil consumption and cleaner-burning engines.

#### Extra Fuel Tanks

If is often necessary to carry additional fuel to make long runs without stops. Select a spare tank or container carefully; it must be made specifically for use as a gasoline container for marine use and conform to recent and proposed regulations that limit the permeability of fuel tanks used on boats. Homemade or converted tanks are hazardous. Tanks from the manufacturer of your motor or from a reputable manufacturer specializing in marine tanks, are best.

Any additional fuel tanks should be carried on board in a well-ventilated area and secured against unnecessary movement. They should be protected from spray or rain. Inspect at least once each season. Dents and scratches can damage the plating that protects underlying steel from rust. A tank that shows any signs of rust should be replaced.

## THE TRAILER

The addition of a trailer to your boating outfit provides considerable operational flexibility to the skipper. It allows traveling to distant boating areas that would be otherwise inaccessible, and storage of the boat at the owner’s home—saving marina fees and facilitating routine maintenance. Also, there is less of a chance for marine organisms to attach themselves to the hull. This reduces the need for periodic and costly applications of anti-fouling paint.

### Selecting the Right Rig

The owner of a trailered boat faces the unique challenge of not only having to select a type of boat and propulsion but also to match up that boat with a trailer and a vehicle that can safely haul, launch, and retrieve it; see Figure 7-23. (The combination of a boat, motor, and trailer is often referred to as a “rig.”) This imposes definite limits on the size and style of boat. Most trailerboats fall into the 14- to 25-foot (4.3 m to 7.6 m) category and weigh 1,000 to 4,000 pounds (454 to 1,814 kg). Although boats up to 40 feet (12 m) or longer can be trailered legally without special permits, 8.5-foot (2.6 m) width limitations in most states and provinces mean that only high-performance or specialty boats much over 25 feet (7.6 m) fall into the trailerable category.

Figure 7-23 A typical well-designed, light-duty trailer is often fitted for one size and weight of boat only. It can offer reliable and affordable use over many years if properly maintained.

Trailerboaters are also limited in a practical sense by the expense of specialized tow vehicles that are needed to haul large and heavy loads. The choice of tow vehicle, boat, and trailer must be made carefully so the combination works well, while fitting the boater’s needs. If you already own a boat, shop carefully for a suitable trailer and vehicle. If you already own a vehicle suited and equipped for towing, you will be limited in your purchase of a boat and trailer by the vehicle’s rated towing capacity.

### Considering Vehicles

The more a tow vehicle weighs, the more sway it can absorb. In other words, weight determines whether the tow vehicle will be in firm control of the trailer or the trailer will be pushing the vehicle around. A heavier trailer can throw both vehicles into a violent swaying motion that could cause the driver to lose control. A tow vehicle should weigh at least as much as the rig it is pulling.

Wheelbase length is another important factor to consider when gauging the ideal fit between trailer and tow vehicle. Cars and small trucks with short wheelbases make poor tow vehicles. Alternatively, long-bed pickups, with their equally long wheelbases, perform excellently. Just like a tow vehicle that is too light, one that is too short may be controlled by a trailer. But note that vehicles with long wheelbases can be hard to maneuver in tight quarters.

Horsepower is another consideration when choosing the ideal tow vehicle. How much is enough? One rule of thumb suggests adding the weight of the boat and trailer and then knocking off one of the zeros. The remainder gives an idea of how many cubic inches of engine displacement you need to adequately haul the load. For example, a 3,000-pound rig would require a 302-cu.-in. (5.0 L) engine, while a 3,500-pound rig requires a 351-cu.-in. (5.8 L) engine. Similarly a large 4,600-pound rig needs a 460-cu.-in. (7.5 L) big-block vehicle engine.

When looking at vehicles, there are other factors that should be added to the equation. Remember that four-wheel-drive vehicles work as well on slippery launch ramps as they do on ice and rain-soaked pavement. Also note that a manual transmission’s clutch will wear out sooner than an automatic transmission when it is used for extensive towing. In addition, the automatic is much easier to use, giving you freedom from the constant up- and down-shifting necessary to keep the engine on the proper portion of the torque curve.

Depending on the engine’s horsepower rating and its rear axle ratio, a tow vehicle is assigned what is called a Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) rating. This figure specifies the maximum loaded weight in pounds of the tow vehicle, its boat, and the trailer. When you subtract tow vehicle weight from GVW, the difference tells you how large a trailered boat your car or truck can safely pull.

#### Vehicle Modifications

A car used with a trailer may need some modifications to give fully satisfactory performance. Rear springs and/or shock absorbers may require replacement by heavier duty units because of the added weight transferred from the trailer tongue. The turn-signal flasher unit may need replacement with one that can handle the added load of the trailer’s signals.

If a heavy trailer is to be pulled, it may be desirable or even necessary to add a cooler for crankcase oil and transmission fluid. Vehicle manufacturers are becoming increasingly specific in the maximum loads that can be towed without modifications, and just what modifications are available. When in doubt, be sure to check your owner’s manual, and be careful not to void your warranty.

Because trailering a big boat imposes heavy loads on the engine, the drivetrain, suspension, electrical system, brakes, and tires, any vehicle destined to pull a boat really needs the special factory towing package that is usually available. This will greatly extend the life of your vehicle.

Driving with a boat trailer behind the car is not as easy as ordinary driving, especially when the craft is high and wide. Some states require unobstructed rear view mirrors on both sides of the towing vehicle. If the boat is quite wide, it is best to install external mirrors (refer to Figure 7-38) that project out far enough to give a clear view behind the boat; these are the mirrors often used on cars that pull house trailers.

### Selecting a Trailer

Like boats and motors, trailers also come in many varieties; they range in price from economy to premium. A light-duty trailer, such as Figure 7-23, may be adequate if all your boating is done locally; a heavy-duty one may be needed if you plan long hauls.

In general, premium models use better construction techniques and materials, and they are often better designed. Economy-priced trailers tend to have fewer cross-members along their frames, which means they have fewer support rollers, with wider spaces between them. Many inexpensive models also use a lighter-gauge steel stock in their frames and are usually bolted together rather than welded—a good weld is a far stronger bond.

#### Adequacy

The trailer for your boat must be adequate in both weight-carrying capacity and length. Underbuy in either of these aspects and your craft will ultimately suffer. Each trailer will have a “capacity plate” with various data on it; see Figure 7-24.

Figure 7-24 The capacity plate on this trailer tongue shows its load capacity, tire size and required pressure, and other data.

The trailer must be able to carry the weight of your boat, motor(s), and the gear stowed in the boat. As a general rule, it is important to remember that the capacity of the trailer should exceed the combined gross weight of boat and motor by about 20 percent. This surplus capacity is intended to handle the extra weight of any gear you will be carrying on board. If there is any doubt, buy the next larger model. Don’t underestimate weights; boat weights given by manufacturers may be for basic models, so try to account for all equipment. Make a detailed list of each item that you plan to install or carry in the boat and its weight, and be sure to include a generous allowance for “miscellaneous.” If possible, use a truck scale to weigh the trailer alone, then the trailer with empty boat and motor, and finally the complete rig with all gear and fuel—you may be surprised at the final gross weight!

#### Length

Trailer length is critical because the boat’s stern area, particularly the transom, must have adequate support. The boat must be able to fit onto the trailer bed so that the aftermost supports extend at least an inch or two beyond the transom; see Figure 7-25. If there is any overhang, the hull will be distorted. This is also true for sterndrive craft, but it is particularly important for outboards, where the full weight of the motor(s) is on the transom. A “hook” (a downward bend) in the hull at the stern, caused by a too-short trailer, can affect both the boat’s speed and its general handling characteristics.

Figure 7-25 As the full weight of an outboard motor or sterndrive is carried on the boat’s transom, adequate support under this part of the hull is essential.

#### Supports

In a boat’s natural environment—the water—the hull is uniformly supported; there are no concentrations of pressure on the hull. However, a trailer can provide support only in limited areas or even points, so the trailer bed must fit the contours of the hull as closely as possible. Plenty of padding and bracing also may be needed.

Supports may take the form of rollers or of padded bars or stringers (bunks), or a combination of some of each. Some trailers, with multiple pairs of rollers on pivoted bars, are designed to conform to the hull shape automatically; these are the self-leveling models. Each type of support system has its advantages and disadvantages; the way the boat will normally be launched and loaded must be considered.

Rollers of hard rubber are widely used on trailers that tilt and allow the boat to move backward into the water by gravity; see Figure 7-26. Their disadvantage is that each roller has very little area of contact with the hull with consequence of high pressure in those areas. The more rollers there are, the better, provided that the height of each is adjusted properly; the depth of the indentation into the roller by the keel is a rough guide as to the weight being carried at that point.

Figure 7-26 A system of pivoted arms with pairs of rollers lets this load-leveler type of tandem-axle trailer conform to the shape of a boat’s bottom automatically after being adjusted for length and beam.

Padded bar supports provide the maximum area in contact with the hull, and thus the minimum of point contact pressure. These are excellent for boats that normally are lifted from the trailer, as by a crane’s slings. They have considerable surface friction, however, and are generally less suitable for sliding the boat off the trailer into the water—unless special features are provided.

There are trailers that use a combination of rollers and padded bars, with a lever system that lowers the bars for launching and retrieval and raises them for additional support when the boat is fully onto the trailer.

There also should be side supports to hold the boat firmly in position on the trailer bed, and a bow chock to keep the boat from moving farther forward. All of these supports must be adjustable and positioned so that they can carry out their functions. Location of the bow chock, for example, should be adjusted so that the transom will be directly over its supports. The boat’s position on the trailer also affects the weight at the trailer tongue and coupling. Any unbalanced condition, once the hull is properly mated to the trailer bed, is properly corrected by shifting the location of the axle and wheels, not the bow chock.

#### Wheels & Tires

Many trailer tires are smaller in diameter than automotive tires. Small wheels position the axle closer to the ground so that the trailer rides as low as possible. A low center of gravity optimizes stability during turns and in crosswinds.

But the downside is that smaller tires sink deeper into potholes and turn at a higher rpm than the tires on the car. These two factors translate into a shorter tire life. As a rule, small tires are best for light boats over short hauls, while larger and/or tandem tires are better for heavier rigs and long hauls. The larger tires provide a smoother ride.

Larger trailers, over 3,000 lb (1,360 kg) capacity, often come with tandem wheels—four tires on two axles; see Figure 7-27. Still larger trailers, over 9,000 lb (4,080 kg) capacity, have three or more axles and six or more tires; see Figure 7-25. There are benefits and drawbacks to multi-axle arrangements. On the one hand, they cost more to purchase and maintain. And because they resist sharp turns, maneuvering in close quarters is more difficult. On the other hand, four or six wheels track very straight—an immense help when backing a big rig down a launch ramp.

Figure 7-27 When the weight of a boat becomes too great for a single axle, it is time to consider a multi-axle trailer. Models are available with two, three, or more axles for larger craft.

Buy the best tires you can afford for both tow vehicle and trailer; they will last longer. An “ST” designation on the sidewall indicates “special trailer” used for boat trailers. These tires have stronger sidewalls than “P” (passenger) and “LT” (light truck) tires. Trailer tires are often odd sizes not readily available when on the road. All trailers should have a spare tire mounted on a wheel that is locked to the trailer.

#### Suspension

Although more expensive, torsion-bar suspension is superior to the leaf-spring type. Wheels are suspended independently, making for a softer ride for the boat over bumps and potholes. The trailer will track better, and torsion-bar suspension will allow the frame and boat to ride lower for better stability. This type will have a longer life than the leaf-spring type, which eventually may rust together and lose effectiveness.

#### Hitches & Couplers

The hitch is a very important component, the main link between vehicle and trailer. Hitch balls are mounted on fixed platforms or on drawbars that insert into receiver-type hitches. Couplers mounted on the front of the trailer tongue are designed to fit neatly over the various balls, with a lever or screw on top that engages a latch that encloses the ball. Once the screw or lever is engaged, the coupler prevents the trailer tongue from bouncing off the ball, while still allowing the trailer to pivot from side to side and, to a certain extent, up and down.

Hitches are divided into four classes:

• Class I hitches (standard fixed-ball bumper hitches) are designed for light-duty loads of up to 2,000 pounds gross trailer weight (GTW) with no more than 200 pounds of tongue weight (amount of trailer weight measured at the tongue). The utility bumper of a light truck or van fits in this category. Some may have frame attachment points.

• Class II hitches are weight-carrying hitches, fixed ball or receiver type, designed to tow up to 3,500 pounds GTW loads with no more than 300 pounds tongue weight. These are basically bumper hitches for the heavier-duty trucks and vans, or usually brackets installed on the car’s frame, since few car bumpers can now handle this kind of weight alone. Figure 7-28 shows a hitch of this class.

Figure 7-28 This Class II frame-mounting hitch features a removable ball mount for better appearance and convenience.

• Class III hitches are weight-carrying or weight-distributing receiving hitches designed to tow in the range of 5,000-7,500 pounds GTW, depending on the size and structure of the tow vehicle. These frame hitches distribute weight using spring bars, mounted between the trailer and the hitch, that transfer a portion of the tongue weight to the front wheels of the tow vehicle.

• Class IV hitches are weight-carrying or weight-distributing hitches designed to tow in the range of 7,500-10,000 pounds GTW, depending on the size and structure of the tow vehicle.

A trailer hitch should be secured to the towing vehicle’s frame either with bolts (using lock washers) or by welding.

#### Hitch Balls & Chains

Hitch balls on the towing vehicle must match the coupler on the trailer tongue and its GTW rating. Balls vary in diameter from 1⅞ inches to 2 5/16 inches; shanks vary from ¾ inch to 1⅜ inches. For the same size balls, shanks may vary and have different GTW ratings. The diameter and GTW rating are normally stamped on each ball. Never use a mismatched coupler and ball.

At least one safety chain between the trailer and the towing vehicle is a must, and two are desirable; see Figure 7-29. When hooking them to the hitch, cross the chains so that the trailer will remain attached to the towing vehicle and under control. It is highly desirable that they cradle the tongue of the trailer and prevent it from dropping to the roadway, but this may not be possible if the chains are long enough to permit the required turns. Check local laws.

Figure 7-29 There is a right way and a wrong way to hook up trailer safety chains. The open end of the hook should go up through the hole, not down through it, so that the hook cannot bounce out. Use of a shackle would provide greater safety. Cross the chains under the trailer tongue so that they will support the tongue if the trailer coupling should fail.

Keep in mind that the chains need to be long enough so that they don’t bind in the middle of a tight turn or when backing down a launching ramp, yet not so long that they drag on the pavement—never hook the chains to the bumper. Chains must have adequate strength; chains furnished with a new trailer will normally more than meet this requirement but may be too long and require shortening. If cables are furnished rather than chains, it is desirable that they be replaced with chains.

On trailers equipped with surge brakes (see below), there may also be a breakaway cable or light chain. Attach it to the auxiliary brake handle mounted on the tongue. Should the trailer break free, the crisscrossed chains will keep the trailer from pole-vaulting, while the breakaway cable activates the surge brake.

There are also available coupler and hitch combinations, such as the Saf-T-Tow, that provide positive action to prevent the trailer tongue from dropping to the road surface or crashing into the rear of the towing vehicle should the coupler come off the ball of the hitch.

#### Brakes

Generally, a lightly loaded trailer can be easily handled by the towing vehicle’s brakes. Larger loads need an independent trailer braking system. Minimum trailer weights for brake requirement regulations vary from one state to another. It is wise to have even better brakes than the minimum legal requirement. Some trailer manufacturers suggest trailer brakes for any load over 1,000 pounds.

Trailers can be equipped with electric brakes that are activated in tandem with the towing vehicle’s hydraulic system, or manually via a dashboard or steering-column control. This system can be adjusted according to the trailer load and works well on the road, permitting independent braking of the trailer to either slow down or even stop the whole rig. On the other hand, when backing up, the system tends to be less efficient. It’s also prone to corrosion and component failures after being immersed in water.

A very popular choice is surge brakes; see Figure 7-30. Hydraulically operated and independent from the tow vehicle, these are activated by a pressure-sensitive master cylinder in a special coupler mounted on the trailer tongue. These brakes are activated when the tow vehicle slows down: As the trailer surges forward, the trailer brakes come on, and the harder the load pushes, the harder the brakes are applied. The brakes come off as the trailer slows and the load on the coupler is relieved. In this way, the surge brakes control themselves, according to the trailer’s braking needs.

Figure 7-30 The surge type of coupler shown above senses the trailer’s momentum when the towing vehicle slows and automatically applies the trailer’s hydraulic brakes.

Trailer manufacturers warn trailerboaters with surge-brake couplers not to shift into a lower gear, but to use the tow vehicle’s engine as a brake constantly rather than intermittently. Each downshift may activate the brakes, overheating them and putting them out of commission. It is better to approach a hill slowly, then brake repeatedly while heading down the hill, giving the brakes time to cool between applications.

Surge-brake couplers are designed to tolerate backing up without the need to deactivate them unless you are backing up a gradient or steep hill. Most states require that the brakes be equipped with a “breakaway” connection that activates the surge brakes if the trailer parts company with the tow vehicle.

Boaters are also warned to avoid getting the brakes wet whenever possible and, if they do get wet, to allow them to dry before starting out on the road. Test the brakes before each trip and after greasing the trailer wheels; inspect the brake linings regularly and replace them when worn.

#### Winches

A winch is needed to help ensure the orderly launching of the boat and easier effective retrieval; see Figure 7-31. While a single-speed manual winch will work fine for small boats up to about 1,000 pounds, most trailers should be equipped with a two-speed manual winch. This allows you to pull the boat out of the water quickly during the initial stages of retrieval, while the boat still has some buoyancy. The increased pulling power of the lower speed is then available when the boat has cleared the water and the winch is pulling its entire weight.

Figure 7-31 Winches (arrow) are used to gain added pull when loading a boat back onto its trailer. Both single- and two-speed models are available; the latter is preferable for all but the lightest of boats.

Electric winches are also available, making recovery of the boat a matter of hooking up and flipping a switch; see Figure 7-32. Powerful electric models (expensive) are especially desirable for heavy boats that are often launched under less-than-ideal conditions, for example, on very steep ramps.

Figure 7-32 An electric trailer winch is especially desirable for loading heavier boats, particularly in less-than-perfect conditions.

Whether manual or electric, the winch must be mounted so that the winch line runs level with the boat’s bow-eye. It should have an unimpeded run aft and, during recovery, should bring the bow snug against the bow-stop roller. A manual winch needs to be cleaned and greased regularly, while an electric winch should be maintained according to the manufacturer’s specifications.

#### Tie-Downs

Do not depend on the bow-winch cable to hold the boat onto the trailer or the bow down into its chock. There should be an additional tie-down of a lashing and turnbuckle. Moving aft, there should be straps of webbing across the hull to hold it firmly in place against the supports of the trailer and to prevent any bouncing up and down on the trailer when on rough roads. There should be additional lashings at each side of the transom; see Figure 7-33. If a trailer as purchased does not have these fittings, they should be added before any extensive trip is made.

Figure 7-33 When being transported, a boat must be held firmly on the trailer so that it cannot shift or bounce on the bed. In storage, at rest, tie-downs should be slacked off a bit to reduce any distorting strains on the hull.

#### Electrical System

A trailer’s electrical system powers its lights—tail, stop, turn signal, marker, and license plate—and in many cases, a braking system. Good-quality components and careful installation are essential for safety and long trouble-free operation. Wires should be protected from mechanical abrasion, road splash, and other physical damage. It is important that there is a ground wire as part of the electrical system between the trailer and the towing vehicle; the coupler and hitch ball do not provide an adequate “return path” for electrical current. Connectors should be heavy-duty and waterproof.

All states require trailers to be equipped with signal, safety, and stop lights operated by the driver. State regulations vary, but generally trailers less than 6 feet 8 inches (2 m) wide need red reflector lights at the back combining stop, tail, and signal lights, along with a white license-plate light. Also required are yellow marker lights on each side of the frame, just ahead of the wheels. Trailers wider than 6 feet 8 inches must add a group of three red identification lights in the middle of the back cross-frame as well as an amber clearance light mounted on the front of each fender. It is often recommended that rear lights be mounted high—usually on a bar across the boat’s transom—but in some jurisdictions this may not be acceptable.

While many trailers being built today are equipped with fully waterproof lights, many still have lights that are simply “submersible.” That means the lights can be submerged in water and will drain on their own. Such lights, however, must be disconnected from the automobile—their power source—before boat-launching time. Even with waterproof lights, disconnecting is always a good idea in order to rule out the possibility of any leaks or shorts in the wiring that could blow bulbs or fuses.

The standard trailer wiring harness, best installed by professionals but easy to repair in a pinch, has a four-prong connector with the green wire going to the right turn signal, yellow to the left, brown to taillights, rear markers, and rear side lights, and white to ground. That means left gets a combination of yellow and brown wires, while right gets a green and brown combination. Seven-wire harnesses are also available with a blue wire for trailer brakes or other extra equipment, red for charging batteries in the trailer or boat, and light green for backup lights.

Trailer builders suggest that you check your wiring for corrosion, bare wires, cracked insulation or other potential shorts at least twice a year; replace and repair any worn or damaged parts and apply waterproof grease to plug contacts and bulb bases to prevent corrosion. Check that all your lights are working before you head out onto the road, day or night.

Trailers are normally sold equipped with several light reflectors. Additional reflectors or reflecting tape may be added as deemed necessary by the owner.

#### Mast & Other Supports

Sailboat spars can be carried lashed to the boat’s deck, on special brackets built onto sailboat trailers, or in custom-made crossbar brackets mounted on the deck or cabin-top. However, if the spars protrude aft beyond the boat’s transom or outboard motor, the end of the spar must be marked with a red signal flag (and a light at night) for safety.

### Trailer Accessories

The items and features discussed above can be considered “essentials”; there are many others that will add to the ease and convenience of using a boat trailer. There are nonskid walkways that can be attached to the frame (see Figure 7-34), allowing you to stay higher and drier during launching and recovery; guide posts, guide rollers, and padded bunk guides that help keep the boat properly aligned on a still-submerged trailer; and even waterproof lights that will light up the frame of a submerged trailer, making it an easier target in the dark.

Figure 7-34 A walkway may be a part of a trailer, or it can be added. Extending along one or both sides of the trailer bed, it can make it easier to guide the boat when it is being launched or retrieved, and it can keep your feet dry, too.

There are a number of accessories available to help line up your hitch ball and trailer couple single-handedly, including “aerials”—with balls and “guides” that lead the coupler toward the ball. With practice you should be able to park your hitch very close to the trailer coupler with great regularity.

One accessory, the dolly-style tongue jack, should be standard equipment for trailers. The jack, equipped with a wheel to allow the tongue and entire trailer to be moved by hand, is usually raised and lowered by a handle-operated worm gear; see Figure 7-35. It should have a pivot and pin that allow it to be flipped up out of the way once the trailer is hitched to the tow vehicle. The dolly wheel and the jack allow you to raise the trailer tongue above the level of the hitch ball, back the vehicle into place, then easily maneuver the coupler right into place and drop it effortlessly onto the ball. A great advantage of this method is that it prevents bruised knuckles and fingers.

Figure 7-35 Using a dolly-style tongue jack is like having an extra person helping to move the trailer manually. It swings down to support the tongue, or up for traveling on the road. Some models remain vertical and are cranked up or down.

### Regulations & Licensing

All trailers must be registered with state or provincial transport departments and must bear an affixed license plate. As long as the boat and trailer combined do not exceed 8 feet 6 inches (2.6 m) in width, about 75 feet (22.9 m) in length and 13 feet 6 inches (4 m) in height, no additional permits are needed. If you’re hauling a double- or triple-axle trailer, though, you will have to pay more to use toll roads. However, keep in mind that these are general guidelines; for specifics, check with your local authorities.

If you’re planning to haul a rig larger than maximum dimensions, arrange for special permits: Contact state highway authorities in areas you wish to transit. These permits might differ from one state to the other.

### Insurance

Know fully the status of your insurance coverage in regard to pulling a trailer with your car. Some automobile policies allow this, others do not, and some provide limitations on hauling a trailer. Check your policy carefully and, if necessary, consult your insurance agent. If an endorsement is needed, don’t delay or neglect to get it, even at the cost of a small additional premium. Be sure you have adequate liability coverage.

## TRAILER OPERATION

Safe, trouble-free trailering depends as much on proper preparations as on correct procedures when on the road. Preparations are not complicated or difficult, but even a single item overlooked can make problems.

### Loading the Boat for Travel

Store heavy items as low as you can, keeping the center of gravity as low as possible. All sharp objects should be padded and propped in such a way that they will not shift should you have to jam on the brakes in an emergency or inadvertently ride onto a curb. Whether or not the boat is covered by a tarp, any gear left inside (especially if it is light enough to be blown away) should be stored in a locker or below decks. Carefully secure any loose gear.

Also avoid the unnecessary weight of a full fuel tank, and carry empty water containers; you can easily fill up once you near or reach the launch area.

#### Balance the Trailer Properly

Check the weight at the trailer tongue after loading the boat with everything to be carried in it; if necessary, shift gear and/or axle(s) as needed to achieve proper weight distribution. Tongue weight should be between 7 and 8 percent of GTW. With a small rig, the tongue weight can be determined using a bathroom scale; on heavier rigs, use a shipper’s scale.

Too much weight applied on the tongue pushes down the back of the tow vehicle, forcing it to “squat.” As well as putting undue strain on the vehicle’s suspension, this can take needed weight off the tow vehicle’s front wheels, making the vehicle hard to steer.

Too little weight on the tongue makes the trailer “tippy” and gives it a tendency to pull up on the tow vehicle. That makes the trailer unstable and more likely to swing from side to side or “fishtail.”

The only proper way to balance a trailer is to move the axle(s) until the desired ratio is obtained. In balancing the whole rig, another very important guideline to consider is the gross axle weight rating (GAW), which is the maximum weight an axle is designed to carry, and is closely related to the tires; see Table 7-2. This figure includes the weight of the vehicle plus any load supported by the axle.

Table 7-2 Figures in boldface are the maximum recommended inflation-load values for tires of each size at highway speeds. Axle loads are the sum of two tire loads.

It is important never to exceed the GAW. This can be achieved by reading the appropriate figures on each of your tires; they will have a maximum for single wheel and one for dual wheel. It cannot be stressed enough that these loads must never be exceeded per axle. To ensure safety, take your rig either to a transport company scale or the local highway trucker scale and ask them to give you a reading per axle.

Weight-distributing hitches spread the tongue weight among all trailer and vehicle wheels. Such hitches are generally used to handle heavy loads that would otherwise put too much weight in back of the vehicle, but must be approached with some caution. Trailer manufacturers warn that such hitches, if overloaded or improperly installed, can cause malfunctions or impairment in operation of hydraulic surge brakes.

### Covering & Securing the Boat

A canvas or synthetic cover, fitted to cover the top of the boat and equipped with a drawstring to pull it tight under the gunwales, will help keep highway grime off the boat. Such a cover, however, must be well secured to stay tied down on the road, and may require a web of extra covering ropes. Once your boat is loaded onto a trailer, with the bunks or rollers all making close contact with the hull, you must ensure that it is well secured before heading out onto the highway. (If a cover is to be used, put it on before fastening the tie-downs.) Most trailers are designed so that the boat can be secured with a safety chain or U-bolt at the bow and two nylon-web tie-downs on the transom. The winch line attached to the boat’s bow-eye should be tight, but you cannot count on it alone to hold the boat.

For a long highway trip, you may wish to secure the boat with additional tie-downs on each side of the boat, near the stern, where the engine—and most of the boat’s weight—is located. These tie-downs must be padded where they contact the boat. They act like sandpaper and can work their way through the gel coat, fiberglass, and anodized surface on aluminum.

Powerboat lower units, outboard or inboard/outboard, are often best trailered and stored in the full-down position; check your owner’s manual for your motor. If this doesn’t allow enough clearance off the road, the engine or drive can be tilted up and a wooden block wedged into the gap to take some of the strain. Also check your motor manual to determine optimum block placement. Remember to remove the blocking before attempting to tilt the motor or sterndrive back down. Special accessories may be available to ensure safe travel of a sterndrive; see Figure 7-36.

Figure 7-36 Trailering clips (seen in red above) are often available to protect sterndrive components while on short or long hauls.

A fixed-keel sailboat, with a high center of gravity, will obviously need to be well secured by a network of tie-downs to the sides, front, and back of the trailer. The mast and boom can be set on pads and secured to the boat’s deck, if it is flat enough, or in specially built cross-member frames that hold the mast level, allowing it to be secured above the boat’s superstructure. Such a rig must be lower than the 13 feet 6 inches (4 m) height limit set by most states and provinces.

### Use a Predeparture Checklist

It is an excellent idea to make a checklist, and use it. Such a list can be typed and then sealed in plastic; thus waterproofed, it can be attached to the trailer tongue where it won’t be overlooked; see Figure 7-37. Make it a habit to run through the checklist in the same sequence each time and you will never overlook any potential problem. See the sidebar “Using a Checklist” on this page.

Figure 7-37 Begin a trip only after all preparations have been made. Use a checklist to make sure that nothing is left undone. If traveling a long distance, plan on stopping at intervals to check tie-downs, wheel bearings, and all lights on the trailer.

#### A Final Check

Just before starting out on the road, make a final rundown of the checklist. Have someone in the car operate the switches for all the lights, depress the brake pedal, and activate the turn signals while you watch. And don’t forget to ask each member of the crew, “Have you forgotten anything?”

### Driving with a Trailer

Driving and steering a vehicle with a 20- to 30-foot articulated extension is neither easy nor intuitive. There will be slower acceleration, passing will be more difficult, and more time and distance will be required for stopping. Although some drivers readily adjust, most need practical advice and practice. Practice in light traffic before taking to the crowded weekend highways. Perhaps the best and simplest advice is to slow everything down. Consider and plan your moves carefully, and remember that you cannot move as quickly in, for example, your van and boat-trailer combination as you would in your two-door coupe.

#### Safety First

The first rule in driving with a trailer behind is “No passengers in the boat.” This practice is unsafe, and it is illegal in many jurisdictions. Do not even allow pets to ride in the trailer.

Drive as smoothly as possible—no sudden jerks in starting, and well-anticipated, easy stops. Jerks and sudden stops put added loads on the car-trailer connection, the boat itself, and the gear stowed in it. Avoid quick turns and sudden swerves; these can make the rig harder to handle.

Just as soon as you start out—before you leave your own property if possible—test your car’s brakes and those of the trailer, if it is so equipped.

Attach big frame-mounted mirrors if those are needed to see back past the boat and trailer; see Figure 7-38. Watch the trailer in the rearview mirrors as much as possible, and keep an ear out for the development of any unusual noises. If a car passes you with its driver or passengers making hand signals to you, pull off the road as soon as possible and check to see what might be wrong.

Figure 7-38 Many boats are of such size or shape that they obstruct normal rearward vision. A large mirror on the right side of the vehicle, as well as one on the left, overcomes this limitation.

Observe all speed limits; these are sometimes less for cars with trailers, and for good reasons. Don’t tailgate; your stopping distance is increased because of the trailer. When driving at highway speeds, allow more room between yourself and the vehicle in front than you normally would; this gives you plenty of time to slow down if the vehicle in front hits the brakes.

Use added caution in passing; remember that your overall length is at least twice as much as normal, and your car will have to be well ahead of the passed vehicle before there is room for you to get back into your previous lane. Remember, too, that it will take longer for you to accelerate to passing speed. Keep in the proper lane; on multi-lane highways, this will normally be the right-hand lane. If there is only one lane in each direction, and traffic begins to pile up behind you, it is courteous and a contribution to safety to pull off the road (where you can safely do so), and let the faster traffic get past you. On multi-lane roads, signal well before you need to turn, and be sure that drivers in the other lane—who may be moving faster—have slowed down and are expecting your move. Even though you are already keeping a sharp lookout on the rearview mirrors, you will want to watch even more closely when changing lanes.

When turning left at an intersection, the boat will tend to follow the path of the tow vehicle, so you’ll have lots of room to make a smooth arcing turn. When turning right into a right-hand lane, you may need to swing a bit wide into the left-hand lane in order to keep the trailer clear of the right-side curb or the roadside margin—it can be embarrassing to bump the trailer tires up over the curb when turning a street intersection. With a turn in any direction, do not cut too closely; at worst, you could jackknife the tow vehicle into the boat and trailer.

Be wary of parking lots or driveways that don’t give you enough space to maneuver.

Figure 7-39 Keep in mind that boat tops are designed for cruising speeds on the water, not the rigors of high-speed roadway trailering. Take down any fabric top and side curtains and secure them so that they won’t be damaged.

##### USING A CHECKLIST

###### CHECK THE BOAT

• Make sure that the outboard or sterndrive has adequate clearance from the road. As discussed on this page, check with the manufacturer for proper transport position: You may have to tilt the motor up as far as possible, and lock or tie it in order to relieve tilt mechanism strain.

• Check that all container lids and caps are secure—from fuel, water, and holding tank deck plates to two-stroke oil can caps. Protect loose containers from possible puncture. Should a spill occur, it should be restricted to the immediate area.

• Ensure that the battery is secure in its box and that the box is lashed down firmly.

• Check that the towing eye is secure and free of play.

• Remove all loose gear (antennas, flags, lines, cushions, etc.) from the deck and cockpit; store these items below.

• Take down any fabric top and side curtains; secure them against the winds of highway speeds.

• For safety during transport, remove a fire extinguisher from the boat and put it in the towing vehicle. This is especially recommended if the boat is covered, as a stray cigarette butt from a passing car could land on the cover and start a fire. (Don’t forget to return the extinguisher to the boat before launching!)

###### CHECK THE TRAILER

• Ensure proper coupler function; a dab of oil or grease goes a long way in preventing rusting. Check the locking mechanism and have a security pin in place. A padlock can replace that pin to prevent theft.

• Check for proper tire pressure, including the spare tire. Grease wheels, using a grease gun if the trailer is equipped with bearing fittings. Check the sidewalls for cracks—if any are present, change the tires. Check the tightness of wheel lugs.

• Check rollers and bunks, and adjust for proper support of the boat.

• If the winch handle is removable, place it in the back of the car. If it is permanently mounted, check to see that the mounting nut is secure. Check the cable or strap in the winch drum—if frayed, it is unsafe. Make sure that the locking lever has a positive engagement; lubricate the mechanism.

• Check the wiring harness for either bare wires or nicks, and repair as necessary.

###### CHECK THE TOWING VEHICLE

• Adjust tire pressure to manufacturer’s recommendations. Check the spare tire at the same time.

• Check that your rearview mirrors on both sides are set properly for the best view of the boat and vehicles to the rear.

• Check hitch installation and tightness of the ball mount.

• Check engine and transmission oil, and as well as radiator coolant. (Remember, these fluids will need to be working harder to accommodate the extra load).

• Check that all necessary tools and spare parts are stowed in the vehicle’s trunk compartment.

###### TIE EVERYTHING DOWN

• Check your tie-downs; one nick in a strap or cable will greatly reduce its load rating.

• You need to take precautions against the boat shifting forward if you need to jam on the brakes. The boat should be secure against the bow chock on the trailer. Should there be a possibility that the bow of the boat may ride up the bow chock, add one or two other tie-downs from the eye to a strong point on the trailer.

• If you decide on extra side tie-downs, it is important that you prepare in three ways: First, use a piece of carpeting or custom sleeve fitted over the tie-downs to protect the boat against gel-coat damage.

Second, avoid routing the straps over anything, such as a cleat, windshield, cushions, the plastic hatch cover, or a railing. Use a ratchet mechanism on the tie-down to tighten it, but don’t overtighten. Remember that the tension that can be generated by a ratchet often equals the weight of the boat and can permanently damage any part of it.

Third, do your best to position the ratchet mechanism on the driver’s side of the road for ease of checking through his mirror. This way, if a tie-down goes slack, the driver will be able to spot it.

• Avoid positioning a tie-down ratchet against or close to any part of the boat. The vibration generated by the wind pressure will cause knocking on the hull or part of the boat. This can result in a pitted patch of gel coat or aluminum. Surround the ratchet device with padding if it is near the boat.

• Always secure the loose end of a tie-down securely; if left loose it will fly in the wind and fray to shreds.

• Make sure that all tie-downs are tight enough to prevent the boat from bouncing on the trailer, but not so tight as to distort the hull. The boat should travel with the trailer as one, with the trailer’s suspension absorbing the shocks of the road.

###### COVER THE BOAT

Consider the following points when you are covering your boat for on-the-ground travel:

• Be sure the cover is snug and well tied. If it has a chance to flap in the wind, it will destroy itself. Dust, dirt, and rain must not be able to get under it.

• If you travel on dirt roads, cover the winch in order to reduce the possibility of grit and debris getting into the mechanism and damaging it.

###### HOOKING UP

When hooking up your trailer to the tow vehicle, use the following checklist:

• Coat the hitch ball with a light coat of grease in order to reduce friction.

• After joining the coupler to the hitch ball, always make sure the coupler is tightened properly and locked according to its design; when in doubt, refer to the manufacturer’s instructions.

• Connect the safety chains immediately, so they won’t be forgotten. If they have an “S” hook, make sure that the open end of the hook goes up through and not down through; it will prevent it from bouncing off. A shackle is better. Cross your chains properly.

• Raise the tongue jack to its “on the road” position.

• If you have a weight-distributing hitch, be sure to set up the spring bars and adjust them so that the bars will level both the trailer and the tow vehicle. The tow vehicle should never squat.

• Systematically check that all lights on the trailer and tow vehicle, including the parking lights, turn signals, emergency flasher, brake lights, and license plate lights, are in good working order.

• Finally, before leaving, make sure that you are carrying all necessary documentation, including your car, trailer, and boat registrations and proof of insurance, as well as any necessary road permits.

#### Stop & Check

On long highway trips at relatively high speeds, it is important to stop occasionally and see how the rig is traveling; see Figure 7-37.

You might stop after the first 1 or 2 miles (2-3 km), then again after about 50 miles (80 km), and then every 100 miles (160 km). The initial check is made soon after departure so that any small problem can be detected and corrected before it becomes a major difficulty. Make each inspection a thorough one. Stopping intervals must, of course, be adjusted to the availability of suitable locations.

Inspection Procedure Follow a regular procedure on each check to make sure that nothing is overlooked. Check the hitch for tightness and the safety chains for the right amount of slackness. Check tires visually. (There is a normal amount of pressure build-up, so don’t bleed off air in the belief that it is excess.) Feel all wheel bearings; warmth is acceptable, but if they are too hot to touch, you have a problem. Let them cool off and then drive as slowly as possible to a service station for disassembly and inspection. Be sure to check the cover and all tie-downs; take a look inside the boat at the stowed gear. Check all lights, especially stop and turn signals.

Check the car’s tires and lights as part of your inspection. Car cooling systems are pressurized; do not remove the fill cap unless you know that there is trouble, and then do so very carefully (check the vehicle’s operator manual).

#### When Conditions Are Bad

Driving in rain, fog, or other conditions of reduced visibility is always a bit more hazardous; it is more so if you are pulling a trailer. Consider the added length of the trailer and your less-favorable acceleration and stopping characteristics. High winds, especially crosswinds, present added hazards, and trailer rigs may be banned from some roads and bridges at these times.

#### Pulling Tandem-Axle Trailers

It has been found that the following characteristics of trailers with two axles can be improved in some cases by not inflating all four tires equally: If you are experiencing any weaving back and forth at highway speeds, try varying the tire pressures by 5 or 10 psi with the front wheels softer than the rear, or vice versa. No specific guidance can be given, except to try various combinations and check for either improved or worsened conditions.

### At Your Destination

Upon arrival at your destination, take time to make an inspection similar to those you did en route. Even if tie-downs are to be removed soon, it is useful to know whether or not they have loosened. Likewise, check the hitch and chains. Hot wheel bearings, or even warm ones, should be allowed to cool before launching. If bearings are really hot, it indicates a possible lubrication problem that could cause bearing seizure and must be corrected before starting home.

#### Maneuvering a Trailer while Backing

The guidelines below are intended to help hone your skills in negotiating a trailer. Along with practice, these will help you anticipate how trailer and vehicle will behave, and to take the necessary actions required for safety.

Driving a trailer backward is trickier than going forward, and takes even more practice. If you’re just starting out, try to find a large deserted parking lot—an office or mall parking lot on Sunday, for example—where you can practice backing in peace, without hazardous obstacles or curious onlookers. That way, you’ll have plenty of confidence when you first pull up to a launching ramp. Remember that in backing up, the vehicle is pushing rather than pulling the trailer. That means, if you want the trailer to back straight, you have to keep the tow vehicle running exactly straight and aligned with it; see Figure 7-40.

Figure 7-40 Backing a trailer to a boat ramp requires basic knowledge of how the car and trailer interact and much practice.

When positioning at a ramp, remember that the trailer always backs in the direction opposite to that of the car. As you approach in reverse, swing close to the ramp.

Then cut the car wheels toward the right. As the car swings slightly to the left, the trailer angles toward the ramp.

Cut the car wheels to the left and back slowly into the ramp as the trailer moves to the right.

Finally, straighten the car wheels to follow the trailer as it backs straight down the ramp.

• Turning the steering wheel right will turn the back of the tow vehicle right and the back of the trailer left. Moreover, if you keep going, the rig will jackknife.

• When you want the boat to keep backing up to the left, you have to follow the trailer and swing the car around in an arc behind it, which means steering back in the opposite direction.

• Turning the steering wheel left swings the back of the tow vehicle left and moves the trailer sharply to the right.

• When you want to keep moving the trailer to the right without jackknifing, you have to swing the steering wheel back to the right, bringing the tow vehicle roughly in a line with the arc of the trailer.

• The trick with backing up is to maneuver the trailer into the direction in which you want to move it, then follow it, driving either in a wide arc or straight back.

• When moving straight back, use a series of shallow S-shaped turns for correction, to keep the rig moving straight.

### Land Storage

Because most trailerable boats are stored on land between uses and during the off-season, such boats usually spend more time on a trailer bed than in the water. In addition to keeping both the trailer and boat in good repair, there are other guidelines for safe and careful storage of both, which are covered below.

• Protect Against Theft and Damage You can create at least partial protection against the theft of your boat and its trailer by installing a special fitting that is secured to the trailer coupling with a keyed lock; see Figure 7-41. Remember, if they can’t “hitch up,” they can’t haul it away.

Figure 7-41 Locks for trailers parked without their towing vehicle can be either of the specialized type shown here or of the padlock style.

When the car is not pulling the trailer, cover the hitch ball with a proper ball cover or an old, split-open tennis ball. This will prevent any grease on the ball from rubbing off on clothing and will provide some protection against rust. Some owners unbolt the ball from the hitch and store it in the trunk or in another protected spot (additional theft protection). With a receiver type of hitch, the shank can be removed and stored.

If your boat will be stored outside for an extended period of time, it is wise to remove the battery, electrical components, and even the motor—if possible—and store these items indoors for greater protection against both theft and corrosion.

• Keep Water Out Rainwater in the boat is undesirable for many reasons—mainly because water collection can rapidly increase weight on the trailer, often beyond its capacity. A cover is desirable, and should be supported so that pockets of rainwater cannot form, stretching the fabric and breaking through it. Cross-supports under the cover and frequent fastening points around the edge will keep the cover sag-free; allow some give in the cover if the fabric is subject to shrinking when wet.

• Drain Accumulating Water Whether your boat is protected with a cover or not, the best way to get rid of accumulated water is to raise the tongue of the trailer, allowing water to run aft and out the drain hole. Crank down the parking wheel to raise the tongue, or, alternatively, block it up securely. Make sure the drain is open.

• Ease Strains on the Hull If tie-downs remain taut after over-the-road travel, slack them off or remove them. This will eliminate any strains and possible distortions to the hull that might occur during long storage periods.

• Block Up the Trailer If you do not expect to use your rig for several weeks or months, the trailer frame should be jacked up and placed on blocks in order to reduce the strain on springs and tires. Be sure to use enough blocking to prevent distortion of the trailer frame—which in turn could distort the hull of your boat.

The blocks need be just high enough to take the greater part of the load, but if the trailer wheels are clear of the ground, reduce air pressure in the tires by 10 to 15 psi. Remember that you must have means at hand to restore pressure when the blocks are later taken out for the next trip—do not deflate tires unless you can pump them up again right on the spot before starting off.

• Check the Rig Frequently When your boat is stored and out of regular use, try to set up a schedule of weekly visits by yourself or someone else acting on your behalf. (Checking at the same time each week will help you remember to do so.) On each visit, thoroughly inspect the vessel for peeling paint and any other visible signs of physical deterioration. It is recommended that you take the necessary corrective action immediately, before any minor problems escalate into major ones.

##### MAINTENANCE, TOOLS & SPARES

Boat trailers are often neglected, and of all their components their wheel bearings are the most critical. Trailers are frequently driven for long times on the highway, often loaded close to their limit. Then after a short, if any, rest period, they are immersed in water during launching and retrieval.

The water seeps into their wheel hubs because of the partial vacuum resulting from the cooling effect of the water on the hot metal. The water emulsifies the grease on the bearings, destroying its lubricating capabilities. If left unattended for any length of time, the water will corrode the bearings’ rollers, resulting in grit in the mixture. Of all stranded trailers, wheel bearing failure is probably the second major problem (after tire trouble).

###### KEEP TOOLS HANDY

When traveling, keep handy the tools you’ll need to deal with minor problems. Include the usual screwdrivers, pliers, and wrenches; wire cutters and strippers; hammer and small sledge hammer; tire pressure gauge; a small hydraulic jack; a lug wrench and a large wrench for the spindle nut; a grease gun loaded with axle grease; a good flashlight or electric lantern; a few rags, and last, but not least, some waterless hand cleaner.

Always keep a few spares on hand. Include a complete hub assembly (hub, prepacked wheel bearings, seals, lug nuts, and cotter pins); a spare wheel with a mounted tire; a few feet of wire and some crimp terminals; and a spare of each type of light bulb used on the trailer, plus a few fuses for the electrical system. Roadside flares or reflective warning triangles might come in handy, and perhaps a 12-volt tire pump that connects to a battery.

## LAUNCHING & RETRIEVING

Both launching a boat from its trailer and its retrieval (loading) are important skills. In each instance, the steps to be taken must be carefully planned and executed to avoid damage to the boat or motor, as well as injuries to people; see Figure 7-42.

Figure 7-42 Make prelaunch preparations well away from the ramp so as to help avoid delays and lengthy lines for ramp use. BE SURE THE DRAIN PLUG HAS BEEN INSERTED.

### Using a Ramp

Although a ramp is not the best way to get a boat into the water, it is the method used most often. Ramps vary widely in their characteristics—many are surfaced with concrete, while others are hard-packed dirt or sand, sometimes reinforced with wood or steel planking. Some ramps are wide enough for only one launching operation at a time; others can accommodate many rigs simultaneously.

The quality of a ramp depends on its slope, how far it extends into the water, and the condition of its surface. The angle of slope is not critical, but it should be deep enough so the trailer need not be backed down so far into the water that the wheel bearings of the tow vehicle become submerged.

If the slope is too steep, however, you may need an excessive pull to get a loaded trailer up and off the ramp. The ramp must extend far enough into the water that trailers can be backed down without running off the lower end, even in low-water conditions. (Many surfaced ramps develop a sharp drop-off at their lower end; if the trailer has rolled past this point, getting trailer wheels back up over this lip can be a major problem. Look for a warning sign.) A dirt or sand ramp must be firm enough to support the trailer and car or truck wheels. A surfaced ramp must not have a coating of slime that could make footing dangerous and provide inadequate traction for the car.

#### Preparing for Launching

While the trailer’s wheel bearings are cooling down (highly desirable), remove the boat cover, fold it, and store it in the car or boat. Tie-downs can be removed and stored in a safe place, but leave the winch line taut. If the outboard motor or sterndrive lower unit has been in the down position during trailering, tilt it up. If the trailer’s lights will be submerged, disconnect the plug to the vehicle’s electrical system.

If you are launching a sailboat, now is the time to check for overhead power lines, then proceed to hoist the mast. On most trailerable sailboats, hoisting the mast is more easily done on land than when afloat; see Figure 7-43.

Figure 7-43 Raising the mast of a sailboat can be trouble free if proper preparations are made. Always check first for overhead power lines. This trailer has rear guideposts.

Remove or relocate equipment stowed in the boat so that the boat will trim properly when launched. If the fuel or water tanks are empty, or only partially filled, now is a convenient time to top them up, unless there is a fuel pier nearby.

#### Use Two Lines

Ensure adequate control of the boat by using two lines. Attach both a bow and a stern line; a boat cannot be adequately controlled by a single line. If you are planning to move the boat to a pier or seawall once it is in the water, put in place any fenders that might be needed.

#### “Preview” the Launching

Study the ramp and surrounding water area for any hazards, such as a slippery or too-short surface; estimate the wind and current effects; see Figure 7-44. If in doubt, as mentioned above, don’t hesitate to ask another skipper who has just launched or retrieved a boat. If you have time, it is useful to watch the launching operations of others, noting any peculiarities of a ramp that is new to you.

Figure 7-44 Make sure that you have inspected the ramp before you line up to use it. If you are not familiar with the ramp, take time to talk to someone who has just used it and learn of any peculiarities or problems. There should be no passengers in the vehicle or boat.

If a drain plug is used, make sure it’s inserted. (Occasionally even an experienced skipper launching a boat suffers the embarrassment of water pouring in the drain.) Look about to make sure no item of preparation has been forgotten, then check the plug again.

#### Launching the Boat

Line up the car and trailer so that the backing process will be as straight and as short as possible; see Figure 7-45. (If you have a rear-wheel-drive car, it might be advantageous to use a secondary hitch on the front of the vehicle for maneuvers on the ramp.) On a wide ramp, give due regard to others and don’t take up more than your share of space.

Figure 7-45 Line up the car and trailer, then back the rig down the ramp as described in the text.

Back the rig down, preferably to the point where the trailer tires—but not the axle bearings—are in the water. Next, set the parking brake on the towing vehicle; for added safety, block a wheel on each side of the vehicle. Then have one person man the winch controls while one or two other helpers take the bow and stern lines; see Figure 7-46.

Figure 7-46 While a crewmember disconnects the bow hitch cable, one or two others control the boat with lines attached at the bow and stern.

Release the trailer tilt latch, if it is of this type. Tighten the winch brake and release the anti-reverse lock. Do not, under any circumstances, disconnect the winch cable from the boat. At this stage, a craft should slide easily off the trailer, its speed controlled by the winch brake; in some instances, a push or two may be needed to get it started; see Figure 7-47. Be sure that the motor is tilted up so the propeller and skeg will not dig into the bottom as the boat slides down.

Figure 7-47 Make sure that one or two crewmembers have hold of the bow and stern lines before giving the boat a light push to float it off the trailer.

When the boat is floating free of the trailer, unhook the winch line. Move the boat aside and make it fast to a pier, beach it, or otherwise secure it temporarily; see Figure 7-48. Return a tilted trailer bed to a horizontal position, and latch it in place. The winch line may be rewound on the drum if desired, or secured by catching the hook on a rear member of the trailer frame and taking up the slack.

Figure 7-48 Make the boat fast temporarily while parking the vehicle and trailer. In this illustration, the trailer is still in the water, showing how far it needs to enter the water in order to launch the boat.

Remove the blocks from the towing vehicle’s wheels, and drive the vehicle to an authorized parking area—be sure to give consideration to others by clearing the ramp promptly and selecting a parking spot that will neither take up unnecessary space nor block others from using the ramp. If it is possible, hose down with fresh water any parts of the trailer that got wet during a launch into salt water.

Use a padlock on the coupling or safety chain to prevent theft of the trailer. Place the chocks at the wheels of the trailer if it is detached from the car and if the parking area has any slope.

At the boat, lower the outboard motor or sterndrive unit to its operating position, and connect the fuel line if necessary. Complete any preparations needed for getting underway—transferring equipment to the boat from the car, for example. Then load up your crew and clear away from the launching area as rapidly as can be done with safety.

#### Reloading onto the Trailer

Beach the boat or make it fast to a pier, and get the car and trailer from the parking area. Although disconnecting the fuel line and running the engine until it quits from fuel starvation is good practice for carbureted outboards that run on a gas/oil premix, it may not be correct for oil-injected or fuel-injected motors. Check your owner’s manual for the correct procedure.

Back the trailer to the water’s edge; make sure that the electrical plug at the vehicle is disconnected. Set the towing vehicle’s brakes and block the wheels. If the trailer bed tilts, release the latch and push the frame into the “up” position. Then tilt up the boat’s motor or sterndrive unit and work the boat into position to move onto the first rollers, with the keel of the boat in line with the trailer.

As with launching, both a stern and bow line help in boat maneuvering during reloading. It may be possible for one of the crew to wade into the water to guide the boat into position. (You can keep your feet dry by using a walkway installed on the trailer frame; refer to Figure 7-34.) Run out enough winch cable to engage the hook in the boat’s stem eye; be careful to watch out for kinks in the cable, and remember to wear gloves when handling a steel wire.

Crank in the winch line and the boat should come onto the trailer bed; a tilted frame will come down to the horizontal position by itself when the boat moves up it; see Figure 7-49. Often a winch has a higher-speed mode that is useful to get the boat started onto the trailer, and a more-powerful mode when the pull gets more difficult.

Figure 7-49 Except for dealing with the mast, launching and retrieving a sailboat are identical to the processes for a powerboat. Always be sure to check carefully for any overhead power lines, and use extreme care if there are any nearby.

Do not allow anyone to be in line with the winch cable. A cable under load may snap like a rubber band when it breaks, and can throw a hook or fitting great distances; so keep clear.

When the boat is fully onto the trailer, latch down the tilt mechanism (if it is of this type), remove the wheel blocks, and move the rig clear from the ramp so others can use it. It is always desirable to hose off the boat with fresh water, but this is especially necessary if it was used in salt water; this should be done as soon as possible after reloading—do not wait until you get home. In some states hosing is required after boating in fresh waters where invasive water plants and/or zebra mussels exist; see this page.

### Launching & Retrieving by Crane

The use of a crane or traveling lift with padded slings is the launching method that is probably the easiest on the boat. When it is exercised with care, this method of launching minimizes strains on the hull; see Figure 7-50.

Figure 7-50 Where a ramp is not available, a crane or traveling lift can be used to lift a boat from its trailer and lower it into the water.

Although the slings are usually provided by the crane operator, check to make sure that these are of adequate strength before entrusting your boat to them. You also should be familiar with the proper placement of slings so as to ensure a safe balance for your boat—your dealer should be able to provide you with this information.

While the boat is in the slings, use both bow and stern lines to control any swinging motion during transit from the trailer to the water, or vice versa.

### Dry Storage Racks

As waterfront property has become increasingly expensive and marinas have been turned into condos and other real-estate developments, slip space has become scarcer and more costly. So have parking areas and open land in and around marinas, where boat owners in the past often left their boats on trailers. To provide room for more boats, particularly smaller boats, many marinas have built what are essentially large sheds filled with storage racks in which forklift trucks can deposit boats in stacks that are four or more boats high. When you’re done boating, you leave your boat in a specified area; generally, a crane will lift it out of the water and deposit it on the forklift truck, which takes it to your assigned rack in the shed. In some marinas the forklift will take the boat directly from the water. In either case, prepare your boat as described above in the trailering section. Most marinas prohibit owners from working on or accessing boats in dry storage racks.

### Clean Your Boat & Trailer

Whether you use a ramp or a crane, fresh water or salt, it is essential that you clean your boat and trailer before you leave the area where the craft was removed from the water. The waters of the United States and Canada are seriously infested with “invasive nuisance” species of aquatic weeds and animals. The most widely publicized of these is probably the zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) now spreading from the Great Lakes into the waters of many states and provinces, but there are many others—a recent appearance of milfoil and giant salvina (Salvinia molesta), invasive aquatic plants, is causing major environmental damage in many areas. These infestations are of major concern, as they crowd out desirable native plants and fishes and cause damage to vessels and shore installations.

In some states special stickers are required on all motorboats and PWCs (either owned by a resident or nonresident) operating in freshwater lakes and rivers. Boaters who do not thoroughly wash down their craft and trailers are guilty of spreading undesired and harmful plants, shellfish, and even fish. All mud and plants must be removed before starting out on the road.

## SMALL BOAT HANDLING

Although boat handling of outboard and sterndrive craft is covered in Chapters 6 and 7, there are some details that specifically relate to lighter, trailerable craft. We will deal with those concerns in this section.

Although the vast majority of trailerable boats have wheel steering, some are equipped with outboard motors with tiller handles. The operator sits in the stern of the boat and pushes the tiller handle away from the direction of the intended turn. On the smallest outboards, reverse is achieved by rotating the engine 180°.

The smaller the boat in relation to the size of the engine, the more you will feel the effect of the engine’s torque. In proportion to the engine’s force, the boat will tend to heel to one side as a reaction to the powerful spin of the propeller. A propeller with large pitch will tend to “walk” sideways as it achieves higher speeds in the water.

### Trim

Remember that the number of seats in a boat is not an indication of the number of persons that it can carry safely. Overloading is a major cause of boating accidents, so stay within the true limits of your craft (check the official capacity plate). The factors affecting trim become increasingly critical as the load approaches the boat’s capacity, and also as boat size decreases.

Before getting underway, trim your boat as well as possible, as shown in Figure 7-51. In smaller craft it is dangerous for passengers to change places or to move about while the boat is moving along briskly. If such movement becomes essential, slow or stop the boat first. (In rough water remember to maintain sufficient momentum to retain steerage control, and to keep the boat headed into wind and waves.) Anyone moving must keep low and near the boat’s centerline.

Figure 7-51 The proper trim of a small boat makes for both safer and more efficient operation.

Proper lateral trim is important for safety.

If the load is concentrated to port, the boat might capsize in a tight left turn or if hit by a wave or wake.

Overload forward causes the boat to “plow.” Running with the bow down may allow the boat to dig into an oncoming wave.

Overload aft causes the boat to “squat,” placing the transom dangerously low to the water.

Distribute passengers and gear so the boat is level; fore-and-aft trim is important for best performance and comfort.

### Stability

Since outboard-powered craft are often operated at relatively high speeds, their stability becomes an important safety issue. Some hulls will run straight ahead quite steadily, but have a tendency to heel excessively, or even flip over, when turned sharply.

The underwater shape of the hull is a key factor in stability. Today, most outboard and sterndrive boats are of deep-V or modified-V form, or of the multiple-hull catamaran or cathedral type; refer to Chapter 1, Figure 1-12. These designs provide a higher degree of stability in normal operation; however, they resist turning—attempts to make a sharp turn at high speed may cause broaching (uncontrolled turning broadside to the seas or to the wind). This is also the case with some older, flat-bottom hull forms that have keels to provide directional stability.

Conversely, a flat-bottom boat without a keel has little directional stability and may skid out sideways when a turn is attempted at excessive speed. Initially the boat will point off in the new direction but will continue to travel along what is essentially its old track.

In any case, the faster a boat goes, the more important it is to reduce speed to a safe level before starting a turn; never turn more sharply than necessary. Normal operation seldom requires a sudden, sharp, high-speed turn.

### Reversing

Most outboard motors have a reverse gear that enables them to be backed down. Unless restrained, an outboard motor has the tendency to tilt itself up and out of the water when thrust is reversed. On many models, there is a manually operated reverse lock that must be latched into place to keep the motor down while engaged in backing maneuvers. For normal running, however, it is important that this latch be released so that the lower unit will be free to tilt up if it strikes an underwater obstruction.

## INFLATABLE BOATS

Inflatable boats are constructed of air-filled tubes, with flexible or rigid floors. The transoms and seats are built of wood, metal, or fiberglass.

These highly stable platforms have found widespread acceptance as dinghies for larger craft, dive boats, workboats, and all-around recreational boating. The material used to build the tubes and other parts of most inflatables is high-strength woven polyester or nylon fabric that is impregnated with flexible but durable “plastomer” coatings. The inside layers of some inflatables are made of neoprene—a stretchy but airtight rubberlike material; see Figure 7-52.

Figure 7-52 An inflatable boat combines lightness of construction with a safe, wide platform and soft contours. Many have a rigid hull beneath the side tubes for better speed and control. Use care when sitting on side tubes, especially if the boat has sufficient power to operate on plane.

Inflatables are stable, unsinkable when inflated, and capable of carrying significant weight; many of them also have the advantage of collapsing into small, portable packages. Although most models are difficult to row, inflatables are easily driven by outboard motors. Because they are made of fabric that is subject to abrasion and wear, care should be taken during use and while being inflated and deflated.

#### Types

The traditional inflatable dinghy or tender was built with plywood floors and inflatable tube seats and was controlled by a tiller-steered outboard. The flat-bottom inflatable hull has given way to a wide variety of hull shapes, including inflated V-hulls and V-hulls with inflated “sponsons.” Some very rigid inflatable floors are also available.

Rigid-hull inflatable boats (RIBs or RHIBs) combine the stability and sea-keeping ability of regular inflatables with the speed and handling capability of regular V-hulls; see Figure 1-06. Because of the hulls’ added strength and stiffness, they can be larger and carry more powerful motors. Some are now available with more sophisticated accommodations, such as remote-control consoles with rigid seats and even “radar-arch” bars for mounting radio antennas and lights; storage areas can also be added. Most RIBs are, in fact, small fiberglass V hull craft surrounded by inflatable tubes. Strength can be built into the boat, and the stability for which inflatables are known is available when needed—while the boat is operating at slow speeds or at rest—but the V-hull comes into play when the boat is on plane and running at speed. While traditional inflatables are usually deflated and disassembled for road travel, rigid inflatables are normally left inflated and carried on a bunk style trailer.

Inflatables need lower horsepower to perform the same work as heavier types of boats; overpowering an inflatable adversely affects maneuverability and balance.

### Towing

Inflatables being towed behind larger boats should have all loose equipment removed. The tow should be from “tow” rings—usually installed by the manufacturer—mounted on the forward underside of the inflatable’s bow area. From these tow rings, a bridle should be created, centered forward of the inflatable’s bow.

A popular position for towing inflatables with sailboats and slower powerboats is snugged up against the transom of the tow vessel. With faster powerboats, a dinghy is normally towed astern on a longer line; to reduce strain on the line, it should ride on the forward side of a stern wave. Note that using three-strand nylon lines for towlines (or trailer tie-downs) is not recommended. This type of line, with exposure to sun and salt, can be quite abrasive, and constant rubbing against the inflatable can cause damage. Braided lines of polyester or polypropylene are the best choice, and the latter will float; a few floats of the type often used in swimming pools can be strung along the towline at intervals to aid in preventing the line from becoming fouled in propellers and rudders.

### Maintenance

Most manufacturers of inflatable boats recommend mild detergent cleaners. Mild abrasive scrubbers will help remove serious grime. Minor cuts and abrasions can be repaired using sandpaper, cleaner, glue, and a patch. Extensive repairs should be done by a professional.

Like other boats, inflatables will grow barnacles or become coated with scum if left in the water unprotected. A special anti-fouling paint is available for them. A properly inflated RIB will be rigid in the water and will not sag or flex with the waves; the operating pressure of a properly inflated boat varies among manufacturers.

Valves should be cleaned once or twice a year, or monthly if the boat is regularly inflated and deflated. Valve cleaning should be done with mild soapy water and an old toothbrush. Check the O-rings; if cracked or pitted, they permit air leakage and should be replaced. Do not use petroleum jelly, silicones, or petroleum distillates on the valves.

## JET-DRIVE BOATS

Various boats, ranging from planing to displacement-type hulls and from small personal watercraft (PWCs) to large yachts, use water jet propulsion; see Figure 7-53. The major features of a jet boat include the following:

• Instant response in accelerating, stopping, or making any sort of turn.

• Low drag because of the lack of appendages.

• Shallow draft.

• Safety around people in the water.

• Absence of hull vibration or torque effects, which eliminates high-speed cavitation.

Figure 7-53 Jet drives are most often seen on personal watercraft (PWCs), but they are also used on small “jet boats” where the operator and passengers are inside a hull, and occasionally on large fast yachts.

The principle of operation is borrowed from aircraft jet propulsion. Rather than having a traditional propeller immersed below the hull, the water jet system draws water through an intake duct and debris screen fitted flush to the bottom of the hull. A high-performance axial flow impeller pumps high volumes of water, discharging it via a nozzle projecting through a sealed transom opening. This results in a powerful forward thrust. Steering is normally accomplished by swiveling the jet stream from side to side; occasionally, there will be a pivoting deflector blade in the jet stream. There are some models of outboard motors that have a jet-drive lower unit rather than a conventional propeller drive.

Jet-drive craft have no steering capability if there is no jet discharging. Reverse is achieved by lowering a deflector, or “clam shell,” to divert the flow of water forward. If done suddenly on a small boat, it stops the boat in its own length—a maneuver that should not be done at high speed because of possible injuries to the operator and any passengers, and/or somersault of the light craft. Because there is no gearbox, shifting from forward to reverse at any speed does not overload the engine—only the direction of the external water stream is altered in stopping or reversing. The pivot point of a light displacement jet boat can be as little as two feet forward of the jet nozzle. Without rudder or lower unit drag, sharp turns can be made; it is possible to reverse course in little more than the boat’s length. Getting into a tight space at a pier can be accomplished by using short bursts of power in forward and reverse.

Jet-drive boats with the best handling characteristics are those designed specifically for this means of propulsion. Their hulls are designed to ensure that the aerated water from the bow wave does not enter the jet, thus avoiding the creation of slip and minimizing power loss.

### Personal Watercraft

A personal watercraft (PWC) is a common introduction to boating for young people. Because such craft use the same waters as other powerboats, it is important to be informed about their use and how to avoid collision.

A personal watercraft is classified by the U.S. Coast Guard as a “Class A Inboard Boat” and is subject to the same laws and requirements as conventional boats. Under the Navigation Rules, there is no difference between operating a PWC and any other craft. You are operating a highly maneuverable boat, but you have the same privileges and obligations as the operator of any other vessel. A proper lookout all around is constantly required. With no navigation lights installed, a PWC may not be used after sunset.

Remember that both the owner and the skipper are responsible for the safety of everyone on board, as well as any damage that may occur from the PWC’s wake—an important consideration when lending or borrowing such a craft. Manufacturers recommend that no privately owned PWC be operated by anyone below the age of 14 or rented to anyone below the age of 16. There may also be state or local age restrictions.

##### PERSONAL WATERCRAFT OPERATION: DOS & DON’TS

• Do know how to swim, but always wear a PFD. Always attach the throttle safety lanyard to your vest before starting the engine.

• Do go slowly until you are in a clear area.

• Do have available an up-to-date chart of the waters where you are intending to go boating.

• Do check for, and obey, “no wake” signs.

• Do look behind you for traffic as you prepare for each turn.

• Do keep a substantial distance between your watercraft and every other person or craft in or on the water.

• Do avoid ship channels whenever possible; if absolutely necessary, cross them vigilantly and quickly.

• Do operate courteously. Showing respect to others will help maintain a high public regard for your sport. Keep in mind that only a few irresponsible operators can lead to restrictive local regulations.

• Do slow down and be extra cautious on your way home. Numerous studies have shown that fatigue caused by the glare, motion, noise, and vibration during a day on the water will reduce your reactions to nearly the same level as if you were legally intoxicated.

• Do not speed in congested areas.

• Do not speed in fog or stormy conditions.

• Do not come too close to another vessel.

• Do not engage in wake-jumping—crossing close astern of larger boats underway.

## WATERSKIING

Since every boater is likely to encounter water-skiers at one time or another while underway—or to participate in the sport—a mention of waterskiing is relevant for safety. This brief coverage of the subject is intended to help the boater anticipate dangerous situations and to respond quickly and effectively.

### The Boat

Waterskiing doesn’t require a large boat with a high-powered engine. Although tournament and show skiers use very sophisticated equipment, the average skier can use the family boat, whether outboard, inboard, or sterndrive. Although it is possible to ski behind a boat as small as a personal watercraft—and even behind an inflatable with a 20-hp (14.7 kW) engine—the normal length is 14 to 20 feet (4.3 to 6.1 m). The most important factor is the size of the engine: It must be more powerful than the required minimum to pull a skier to a standing position. Otherwise, the waterskiing can overload the motor, reducing its useful lifespan.

When pulling skiers, it is important to maintain constant speed—ideally using a speedometer and/or a tachometer to ensure that the engine won’t exceed its maximum rpm. To achieve maximum efficiency when towing skiers, using a smaller pitch propeller will help to keep the power to its maximum in the ranges of speed used. Top-end speed may be lower, but acceleration will be better. For the best steering capability, the towline for the skier should be fastened to a high point well forward of the transom on a post called a pylon; alternatively, a bridle can be attached at two points through-bolted on the stern. Never tie to one corner only, as this could cause a small boat to upset and greatly hinder maneuverability on larger boats.

Since verbal communication between the skier and the boat’s crew is difficult if not impossible, it is essential that a universally accepted group of signals be used. Using the observer as an intermediate to the driver, the skier is able to communicate his wishes by these gestures, shown on this page; see Figure 7-54.

Figure 7-54 Since verbal communication between the skier and the towing boat crew is difficult, if not impossible, it is essential that hand signals be used. It is helpful if a standardized, universally accepted system of signals is employed. Using an observer as an intermediary to the boat driver, the skier is able to communicate his status or wishes by these gestures.

### Safe Waterskiing: Dos & Don’ts

• Do learn good swimming skills. This is important for the skier and for the boat’s crew.

• Do wear a PFD that is secure, durable, and is not too bulky or awkward.

• Do familiarize yourself with safe boating procedures. Falling overboard is often considered part of the fun; be prepared with a flotation jacket or belt.

#### The Skier

• Do learn about waterskiing from a qualified instructor.

• Do make yourself visible if you fall in waters where traffic exists. Hold a ski halfway up to alert boats nearby.

• Do not put any part of your body through the bridle or place the handle behind your neck or knees. A fall in this position has the potential for serious injury.

• Do insist on having a competent observer in addition to the driver—someone who is appointed to watch the skier at all times and report to the driver of the boat. That observer should be able to physically assist the skier in case of need. Above all, the lookout should remember that objects and other boats present the greatest danger. Be aware that an observer is a legal requirement in most states.

• Do not dry-land at a dock or beach. Any error in judgment could result in an injury.

##### SAFE OPERATION OF SMALL CRAFT

A carefully matched boat, motor, and propeller, operated in accordance with the law and with courtesy, will go a long way toward eliminating many accidents and worries. But some possibility for trouble always exists; the wise boater should be prepared to act in an emergency. Much of the information listed below is of particular interest to small-boat and personal watercraft operators as well as water-skiers. Refer also to Chapters 11 and 12 for more extensive safety-on-the-water and emergency information.

###### COMMON CAUSES OF ACCIDENTS INVOLVING SMALL CRAFT

• Overloading, overpowering, and improper trim.

• High speed turns, especially in rough water.

• Failure to keep a lookout for obstructions and other boats.

• Going out in bad weather (or not starting for shelter soon enough when weather starts turning bad).

• Standing up in a moving boat.

• Having too much weight too high in the boat, such as people standing up while underway.

• Leaks in the fuel system.

• Going too far offshore.

###### SAFE OPERATING PROCEDURES

• Allow no one to ride on the bow. A person who slips over the side may be run over by the boat before the skipper can take action.

• Stand clear of hazards. Strong river or tidal currents around large objects, such as moored barges and vessels, can create a hazard for small boats, which can be pulled beneath the surface. Give such situations a wide berth.

• Slowing and stopping. Watch your own stern wave; it could overtake you and swamp your boat.

• Fuel consumption. There is no excuse for running out of fuel. Keep tanks near-full and know the fuel consumption on a per-hour or per-mile basis. Always plan for a reserve of at least one-third of your total capacity.

• Leave word behind. If you are going offshore or for a long run on inland waters, or even just fishing some distance away from home, tell someone ashore what your plans are, giving as much detail as possible (Chapter 11).

• Watch the weather. The smaller the boat, the more vulnerable it is to approaching bad weather. Take early evasive action; head for safe waters while there is ample time. Always keep an eye on the weather.

• Carry distress signals. Even though the size of your craft might not warrant the need to carry emergency equipment and flares during the day, it is nevertheless good practice to carry some in case you are delayed or stranded. Learn the proper emergency procedures.

• Watch for squalls and storms. If you get caught in bad weather, the information included in Chapter 10 is good even for small craft. The basic safety rules apply: Everyone should wear a PFD. Go slowly. Check your weight distribution. If the motor quits, keep the bow to the waves. Don’t let water accumulate in the boat.

• Know what to do if you capsize. Unless your life is threatened, stay with the boat, which is easier to spot than a swimmer alone. All small boats built after July 1973 must carry flotation to keep them upright.

• Know what to do in case of accident. If you are involved in a boating accident, you are required to stop and help if you can without endangering your boat or passengers. You must identify yourself and your boat to any person injured or to the owner of the property damaged. See Chapter 12 for information on reporting accidents and recovery procedures.

#### The Boat Operator

• Do always look ahead. Plan your speed and turns according to the skier’s ability.

• Do return quickly to a fallen skier.

• Do not drive on any course that could jeopardize the skier’s safety.

#### Both Skier & Boat Operator

• Do check equipment regularly, especially before skiing; skis with nicks could cut or scrape skin. Make sure ski lines are free of tangles, loops, and knots.

• Do not ski in shallow water—water less than about 6.5 feet (2 m) deep.

• Do not ski at night (established as being from one hour after sunset until sunrise).

• Do not ski near boats, docks, or swimming, scuba diving, sailing, and fishing areas. Also avoid close proximity to the shore, stationary objects, narrow channels and harbors, and busy areas.

• Do not prevent people on shore, or other boaters, from enjoying the peacefulness of open waters and beaches. Noise carries farther over the water than on land, particularly when it is otherwise quiet. Remember that early morning and late afternoon are times when many boaters value quiet most. When waterskiing or operating PWC at high speeds, stay away from anchorages, shoreline areas with homes, campgrounds, and other places where people go for peace and quiet.

##### KILL SWITCHES

Personal watercraft and outboard engines of low horsepower intended for use on dinghies and other craft that are susceptible to throwing the operator overboard are equipped with a kill switch that will stop the engine or put it in neutral gear. This is connected to the operator by a short lanyard, which should be attached to the operator’s PFD or clothing. If an engine is not so equipped, it may be possible to add this safety feature.

Sailing is an old and complex art—sailors can spend a lifetime at it and still find that there is more to learn. It is also a simple and enjoyable activity. A beginning sailor can have a fine time in a sailboat on his or her first day out, provided a few precautions are observed regarding the weather and safety on the water.

Experienced powerboat people, as well as those new to water sports, are taking up sailing in increasing numbers. While most of the seamanship and piloting chapters in this book apply equally to sailboats and powerboats, there are terms used specifically on sailboats and special equipment used to accomplish many sailing seamanship maneuvers.

## HOW A BOAT SAILS

The art of sailing, one of the oldest studies in the world, has been joined by the science of sailing, with its complex laws of physics and the lofty mathematics that describe them. Fortunately, along with the wind tunnels, sensing devices, and computers that confront us with all of sailing’s complexity, there has come technology that has broadened the methods and materials we use to build and sail boats. The improvement in construction and safety of sailboats is obvious—and no less so the ability of modern sailors to take advantage of it—but both the art of sailing and the science of sailing are very much works in progress.

While sailors can take heart that the underlying physical phenomena can be used without being completely understood, it should be noted that sailing has been studied assiduously for centuries. The interaction of the wind, water, hull, sails, and keels—to say nothing of the involvement of sailors—is complex, often simultaneous, and, indeed, at times invisible and even intuitive. But each progression in its understanding has led to easier and faster ways to sail.

Keep in mind that while the following discussion of how and why a boat sails is broken into sections so as to be intelligible, the elements that are discussed in isolation are in fact seldom isolated. On a sailboat, little happens that doesn’t have an effect on everything else.

### Bending the Flow

Sails extract energy from a flow of air (the wind) by bending it as it goes by. This is true of every kind of sail, ancient or new, and it is true whether the sail is moving across the wind or being blown along with it. As they create a driving force, or lift, from the wind, sails also create a small amount of drag—the smaller the better.

The underwater surfaces of a boat, meanwhile—whether the carefully shaped hull and highly efficient foils of a racing yacht or the broad and bulky underwater expanses of an old-fashioned cargo hull—bend the flow of water that passes over them. The interesting thing about sails (“airfoils”) and keels and rudders (“hydrofoils”) is that, while they operate in very different fluids, the principles that govern them are the same.

### Push Equals Shove

A sailboat hull, driven by aerodynamic forces, accelerates until resistance from various forms of drag, both aero- and hydrodynamic, equals the driving forces. At that moment, the sailboat stops accelerating and travels at a constant speed—constant, that is, until something changes. This equalization of driving and dragging forces may be short-lived as the boat sails into a changing wind, is buffeted by waves, or alters the delicate flow patterns through the actions of its crew. The crew, of course, hopes to alter the equalization in favor of the driving forces, causing the boat to accelerate. When the crew is successful, a larger drive is soon countered by a larger drag and, once again, the boat settles into a “steady state”—but at a higher speed.

### Airfoils vs. Hydrofoils

Sailboats and airplanes bear some kinship because both depend on a careful use of fluid motion over curved surfaces. But a sailboat operates within two fluid media—air and water—whereas an aircraft operates in only one. The airplane’s airfoils (wings) pull in one direction—upward.

The sailboat’s foils pull in nearly opposite directions—the sails to leeward and the keel to windward; see Figure 8-01, left. Each depends on the other to make the sailboat work—to make it move. Sails could not extract energy in any useful way without the work of the keel, and the keel could not do its work if the boat were not being pushed; see Figure 8-01, right.

Figure 8-01 The sails and underwater surfaces of a boat both act as foils. The sails bend the flow of air over their surfaces, converting some of its energy into forward and lateral motion (lift), and some into drag. At the same time, water flowing past the hull and its appendages produces lift to windward, as well as drag.

Historically, the airfoils on a sailboat (its sails) have received a lot more attention than the hydrofoils. Designers have developed complicated ways to make them more efficient over a range of wind speeds by changing their shapes and their angles to the hull. On the other hand, hydrofoils have been left pretty much on their own while the boat is underway. But this is changing. Designers are now finding ways to modify the shapes of keels, including the addition of trailing edge flaps like those used on aircraft wings.

### Bernoulli’s Discovery

In the early 1700s, the Swiss scientist Daniel Bernoulli established that changing the velocity of flow of a fluid, such as air or water, at a specific point brings about a consequent inverse change in pressure at the same point. Bernoulli’s law led to its application in the venturi effect—such as when the flow of a fluid in a tube is constricted, resulting in increased velocity and decreased pressure—and the development of the curved foil. The most convincing demonstration of the venturi effect is easy to perform in the kitchen. First, run a stream of water from the faucet. Then, dangle a soupspoon by the tip of its handle and move its convex surface slowly toward the stream. Rather than being pushed away, as your intuition might suggest, it is pulled into the stream.

#### Action of Flow Over Foils

The most familiar practical application of the venturi effect is seen in the behavior of an airfoil, such as an airplane wing. As the aircraft moves along a runway, the induced airflow (from the plane’s motion) separates as it strikes the leading edge of the wing. The velocity of the airflow forced to travel over the airfoil’s convex upper surface increases because it spans a greater distance than the air that travels beneath the wing.

Following Bernoulli’s law, the increased velocity on the upper surface of the wing is accompanied by a decrease in pressure relative to that on the wing’s under surface. Since a region of high pressure will try to push into one of low pressure, a force is produced. Aviators began calling this force lift, and we use the same term when talking about boats. (The term “lift” also has another meaning, discussed later in this chapter.) Depending on the shape of the surface, the speed of the flow, the angle at which the foil meets the airflow, and other factors, more or less lift is produced. The faster an aircraft’s forward motion induces airflow across its wings, the greater the pressure differential and the greater the lift. Ultimately, the high-pressure area beneath the wing, in attempting to displace the increasingly lower pressure area above it, lifts the wing—and the aircraft to which it is attached—upward and off the ground.

An asymmetrical airplane wing, curved on the upper surface and almost straight on the lower surface, can produce some of its lift even when it is pushed in a line parallel with the oncoming airflow—that is, with no angle of attack. The sails on a sailboat, acting as a vertical wing or airfoil, ordinarily don’t have thickness the way an airplane wing does. Lacking thickness and asymmetry (because they have to produce lift alternately on both sides), sails must be presented to the flow of air at an angle; see Figure 8-02, upper. This is why sailboats lose their drive, or end up in irons, when they are steered too close to the wind.

Figure 8-02 A thin foil, such as a sail (upper), must be presented to the wind at an angle of at least 30 degrees (called the “angle of attack”) in order to create a low-pressure area across its leeward surface. The sail tries to move into that low-pressure area, producing forward and lateral movement of the boat. Similarly, a keel or rudder (lower) must be presented to the water flow at an angle in order to create high- and low-pressure areas and lift. This angle of attack should only be 2 or 3 degrees..

When a sail is set at an efficient angle, air flows across its leeward surface at greater velocity than across its windward surface, and a low-pressure area is created to leeward. The sail tries to move into it, impelled by the relatively higher pressure on its windward side. This driving force created by the sails is transmitted to the hull through the mast, sheets, and sail attachments. The boat begins to move, but not necessarily in the right direction—not yet.

#### Drag

As a sail creates lift, it is also creating unwanted drag, an unavoidable byproduct of friction and turbulence along the sail’s surface and at its edges. Boats rely on the flow of the wind—relatively slow compared to the much faster airflow generated by an engine-powered aircraft. They are severely limited in the amount of energy they can exploit. When resources are scarce, skills are challenged even more. Being able to change the sail’s shape and the angle at which air flows over it to suit varying wind strengths and directions is critical to extracting the required lift from the available wind energy and to minimizing the inevitable drag.

If there is no corresponding hydrofoil already at work, the result of this careful sail trimming is just unresisted sideways motion, resulting in slower airflow, resulting in less speed—in other words the boat slides aimlessly. You have probably seen this happen when a sailing dinghy leaves the pier with its centerboard up.

#### Underwater Foils

The addition of underwater fins—a keel or centerboard, and a rudder—vastly increases lateral resistance. Again, unlike most airplane wings, a sailboat’s foils are symmetrical (because they have to work the same way on both sides). Hydrofoils, like sails, must therefore meet the oncoming flow at an angle, called their angle of attack, before they develop any lift. Since most keels are rigidly attached to their hulls, the whole boat has to be aimed a couple of degrees to windward of the course it travels; see Figure 8-02, lower. This isn’t something the helmsman has to think about; rather, it happens naturally, because all sailboats make a bit of leeway (i.e., they sideslip) when sailing on the wind. A modest amount (2 or 3 degrees) of leeway isn’t a flaw that should be corrected; it’s essential for developing the hydrodynamic lift that allows the boat to sail to windward.

As the dinghy sailor lowers the centerboard, he or she might also allow the sail to aim its effort in a more forward direction by letting it out just a little. Now the airfoil and hydrofoil get down to work—against each other. As each begins to encounter faster flow (we are dealing in less than walking speed here, so “fast” is a relative term) each foil begins to produce lift. The centerboard produces lift to windward as well as drag, while the sail produces lift to leeward and slightly forward. It’s the “slightly forward” that makes things happen.

Creating more lift (and causing less drag) is the ultimate objective of high-performance sail and keel design. (This also explains why there are now designers who specialize in “appendages,” keels and rudders, and others who design hulls—both separate from the people who design sails.) Of course, they have contrived a whole set of labels and rules to talk about it. Two important labels in this discussion are center of effort (CE) and center of lateral resistance (CLR). These are really just two sides of the same coin, because both centers involve foils—“effort” for the sails, and “lateral resistance” for the keel and rudder; see Figure 8-03.

Figure 8-03 The center of effort (CE) is the position of the sum of all the lift and drag forces produced by the sails. The center of lateral resistance (CLR) is the equivalent position of all forces produced by the hull and its appendages. When the two centers are balanced against each other, the boat travels in a straight line (upper). When they are out of balance, the boat turns. Changing the rudder angle (lower) shifts the combined CLR aft so that the boat turns to leeward.

Now that computers are able to analyze the contribution of every carefully shaped square inch of foil surface, the center of effort and its twin, the center of resistance, are much easier to find. Both centers are simply the sum of all of the lift and drag forces at work anywhere on the foil. If you had to attach a string somewhere on the sail and another on the underwater surface, and pull the boat along by these two strings—creating the same force and balance as a particular strength and direction of wind—the center of effort is the place where you would attach the sail’s string, and the center of lateral resistance is the place you would have to attach the underwater string.

### The Balancing Act

Both centers (CE and CLR) are constantly changing with boat motion and sail adjustment. Unfortunately, the net effect of lift and drag that the CE represents does not pull the boat straight ahead. (Remember that we said the boat would start to move, but not in the desired direction.) The force acting at the CE on the sails pulls partly forward but mostly to leeward, and the forces acting on the CLR of the hull, keel, and rudder act to windward and slightly aft. These forces are in balance when the boat is traveling in a straight line. When they are out of balance, the boat turns; refer to Figure 8-03.

Keeping in mind that a boat sails fastest when its keel and rudder are presented to the water flow at a slight angle, designers place the sails on the hull in such a way that, if no steering force were applied with the rudder, the boat would turn itself gently toward the direction of the wind (weather helm). When the boat is sailed, a straight course is achieved by the gentle application of 2° or 3° of rudder angle in the opposite direction; see Figure 8-04. In a well-trimmed boat, the keel will have an angle of attack of 2 or 3 degrees by virtue of leeway, and the rudder’s angle of attack might be 4 to 6 degrees by virtue of leeway plus the slight rudder angle required to counteract weather helm. However, you can have too much of a good thing. An excessive imbalance between CE and CLR, one that requires more than a slight rudder correction, causes the rudder to develop drag commensurate with the greater lift it is being forced to create. The boat decelerates—slower speed means less drive from the sails—and things settle back into the drive-drag equilibrium at a slower speed.

Figure 8-04 The keel (or centerboard) must be presented to the water at a slight angle of attack (ideally 2° to 3°) in order to create maximum lift, and the rudder will need 2 or 3 degrees of deflection to counteract weather helm. Thus, the rudder’s overall attack angle will be 4 to 6 degrees.

In moderate wind (up to 10–14 knots), a sailboat that is properly balanced exhibits a weather helm—a tendency to turn into the wind. This is counteracted by pulling the tiller slightly to weather (the direction of the wind) or turning the wheel away from the wind. A sailboat that acts in this way is considered safer because in the event of gear failure or lack of attention to the helm, it will round up (head into the wind) rather than fall off into a possibly dangerous jibe (pronounced with a long “i” as in “ice”). Weather helm should decrease as wind strength abates.

A lee helm is the opposite of weather helm, a tendency for the boat to wander off to leeward; many sailboats develop a slight tendency for lee helm in light air. Acceptable in very light winds, lee helm is undesirable in stronger winds. A straight-line course can only be achieved when the rudder is turned to create a force pulling to leeward (so the bow is pushed to windward). This means that no windward lift is being created by the rudder, so all of it has to be created by the keel. The keel then ends up at a more extreme angle of attack to produce this lift, and in the process creates more drag. The boat makes more leeway and slows down.

It should be noted that all of these differences in balance are important to the cruising sailor as well as the racer. Though they are difficult to perceive—3° is hard to see and often difficult to feel in the helm—they produce substantial differences on almost all points of sail. The racing sailor may lose a race, but the cruising sailor may make serious errors in navigation by failing to account for large leeway angles that result from excessive imbalances.

Incidentally, keels and rudders can be a lot smaller in area than sails because they operate in a denser medium. In addition, when they are pushed through the water at greater speeds, they can produce sufficient side forces with less area—that’s why the crews of fast, planing catamarans often reduce drag by pulling up their foils (usually daggerboards) a few inches at high speeds, even though they are sailing upwind.

Conversely, if there is no speed at all, there is no flow and neither the keel nor the rudder can do its job. A boat that has no way on cannot be steered, which is why steerageway is so important. Skippers will often do whatever they can to get a boat settled down and underway so as to create some flow past the keel and rudder before they worry about what precise direction they’re going.

### Outsailing the Wind

For most novice sailors, the idea that a boat can sail faster than the wind is questionable at best. Even the less ambitious claim—that a boat can receive more power from the wind as the boat picks up speed—seems contrary to common sense. After all, there is no source of power other than the wind.

#### The Effect of Apparent Wind

But it’s true, and an understanding of apparent wind, the stronger wind partly created by the boat’s own speed, is crucial to sailing. Let’s look at two extreme examples—a very slow boat and a very fast boat.

The slow boat is a Spanish galleon. It has no separate keel and, by modern standards, inefficient sails. It sails most effectively with the wind behind it, and even then it doesn’t sail very fast. If the galleon were just getting underway, and if the wind were exactly on its stern and blowing at 10 knots, the wind felt by someone standing on deck would be 10 knots. As the galleon picked up speed, the wind felt on deck (the apparent wind) would decrease, because the ship would be moving along with it. The effect of the wind on the moving sails would also decrease. At somewhere around 2 knots of vessel speed through the water, the decreasing force created by the sails would exactly balance the increasing resistance of the hull (discussed later), and the galleon would stop accelerating and settle down for a long trip to its destination. Vessel speed would be 2 knots, wind speed 10 knots, apparent wind speed 8 knots.

Now take the fast boat—an iceboat—in a similar situation. With almost no hull resistance to overcome, the iceboat picks up the same 10 knots of wind from directly astern and, within seconds, the skipper is aware of a rapidly decreasing apparent wind. His boat reaches a balance between the decreasing force of the wind and the increasing resistance of the iceboat at, for example, 9 knots (boat speed 9 knots, wind speed 10 knots, apparent wind speed 1 knot).

Now, 9 knots would be pretty exciting in a Spanish galleon, but in an iceboat, it’s not worth chilly feet. So the iceboat skipper turns his boat so that it begins to travel on a line perpendicular to the wind. He does this without losing any speed, so his initial speed, after the turn, is still 9 knots. At that instant, the iceboat skipper feels the full force of the 10-knot wind, because he’s no longer traveling away from it. He also feels the force of a 9-knot wind, just as if he were on a bicycle pedaling at 9 knots. These two vectors, at right angles to each other, can be added (vector addition is discussed in Chapter 17), the result being an apparent wind of about 13.5 knots flowing into the iceboat at an angle of about 47° off the bow.

The Spanish galleon, still traveling at 2 knots, also turns so that it is sailing on a line perpendicular to the wind. The new wind across its decks is also a vector sum of the 10-knot wind and the 2-knot boat speed. The result is a less-than-impressive 10.3 knots at an angle of about 79° off the bow. The galleon responds to this slightly stronger apparent wind (which is still hitting at an angle wide enough for its square sails to make use of) by accelerating. Again, the force on the sails is balanced by the increasing resistance of the hull, and things settle down again—at 2.5 knots.

However, aboard the iceboat, things start to happen. Its highly efficient sail and almost-zero hull resistance respond to the new, stronger wind. It begins to accelerate again. The first one-knot increase in boat speed, to 10 knots, brings a new apparent wind, 14.1 knots, at a new angle of 45 degrees. This angle is still no problem for an iceboat sail, so it responds to the new apparent wind strength by gaining another knot. Now the apparent wind is very close to 15 knots and the angle is still comfortable—producing more acceleration.

Where does it all end? Well, this is not perpetual motion (though, in an iceboat, it can often feel that way!). Things start to level off when the apparent wind goes so far forward that the sail begins to point too directly into the wind. It can no longer achieve a useful angle of attack, and it luffs. At this point the iceboat is probably experiencing an apparent wind of almost 45 knots and is doing almost 40 knots of boat speed—pretty good for a wind strength of 10 knots. In fact, with strong winter winds and cold, dense air, iceboats routinely travel at speeds of more than 50 knots. At that speed, their sails are strapped in tight regardless of what direction the “real” wind is blowing—their apparent wind is far more important, and it’s blowing from almost straight ahead; see Figure 8-05.

Figure 8-05 Apparent wind is the direction of the wind as it appears to a person on board. Both boat speed and the boat’s angle to the true wind affect the direction and strength of the apparent wind. In the vector diagram shown here, the yellow arrow is the wind from the boat’s motion, and the white arrow is apparent wind. Apparent wind is greater than true wind when the boat is sailing at an angle of 90 degrees or less from the true wind.

The effects of apparent wind on most sailboats are far more dramatic than aboard the galleon and far less than aboard the iceboat. Even a heavy racing sloop might increase its speed by 25 percent as a result of a stronger apparent wind. Sailboats that are less limited by their weight can easily double their speed with careful use of apparent wind.

There are some fundamental rules about apparent wind:

• Except when sailing directly downwind, apparent wind will always come from “farther ahead” than the true wind does.

• Sailing on any angle ranging from perpendicular to the wind to an angle quite close to the wind, apparent wind will always be greater than the true wind.

• As wind strength increases, the angle of the apparent wind moves farther aft; conversely, as wind strength decreases, the apparent wind moves farther forward. A strong gust of wind is usually welcome because it provides more power applied from farther aft.

### Heeling

For the most part, boats sail most efficiently in an upright position so that aerodynamic and hydrodynamic lifts are converted into forward motion. But the same dynamic forces that pull the boat forward also try to push it over.

The sails, which have their CE at about 40 percent of the height of the mast, and the keel with its corresponding CLR well below the water, both act as levers with the hull in the middle as their fulcrum.

In general, there are two ways to counter these forces and prevent them from pushing the boat over and capsizing it. These are weight and width; see Figure 8-06. Both have disadvantages. Energy extracted from the wind is partly absorbed in the work of moving weight, especially if that weight begins to move up and down through waves, so any extra weight robs speed. Width makes a hull harder to push through the water (unless the boat is separated into two hulls, or three, that are spread apart).

Figure 8-06 In these illustrations, B is the center of buoyancy and G is the center of gravity. Sailboats can use either weight (left) or width (right) to remain upright against the force of the wind. A hull stabilized primarily with weight has a very small righting moment as it begins to heel, but that increases steadily as the craft heels farther over. Such boats are initially “tender” and ultimately “stiff.” As the wind increases, a ballasted hull will lean over, increasing the righting moment, but the wide, unballasted hull has already achieved its maximum righting moment and is becoming increasingly unstable as the angle of heel increases.

Most sailboats use both weight and width to stay upright. The width of the hull is the first line of defense because buoyancy begins to provide substantial righting moment (it pushes back) as soon as the hull begins to heel. Fixed ballast gains in importance as the hull heels farther over.

Different sailboat designs rely more heavily on one or the other method. The classic heavy, narrow “meter boats,” such as the 12-meter class formerly used in America’s Cup competition, were intended to balance at a substantial angle of heel sailing close to the direction of the wind. Designers shaped their hulls in such a way that they would have greater potential speed when heeled than when upright. The basic method is explained on this page in the discussion of form resistance.

Most recent racing designs, such as the J-24, rely more on a wide, shallow hull. With this hull type, crew weight becomes even more important, especially because crew weight can begin to provide righting moment even before the hull begins to heel. That’s why the best-sailed dinghies sail through gusts of wind without heeling—their crews move into position in perfect synchronization with the changing aerodynamic forces, converting every increase in power into forward acceleration rather than heeling.

As the boat begins to heel, several factors combine to rob it of forward speed. The force created by the sails is now aimed partly downward (instead of parallel to the water), thereby helping to immerse the hull into the water rather than pulling it forward. Less sail area is exposed to the horizontal movement of the wind. A corresponding deterioration takes place underwater, where the flow of water across the keel and rudder are compromised. The part of the hull that is underwater becomes asymmetrical, creating turning forces that have to be counteracted.

A more subtle change also takes place. The forces created by sails and keel are no longer acting directly above and directly below the hull—they’re both displaced sideways. The effect is similar to what would happen if you were pulling the hull with a towline. When the boat is upright, the towline pulls along the hull’s centerline. As the boat heels, the effect is as if the towline were uncleated and made fast again at the gunwale near the widest point of the beam. In this case, you would expect to fight the boat with its rudder to keep it on a straight course. When the boat heels, its propulsion forces operate away from the hull’s centerline. That’s why boats that are allowed to heel too far under the pull of a spinnaker are so vulnerable to broaching. It also explains why, when a sailboarder leans back into the wind at high speed, he must also move to the tail of his board, holding the sail well aft of the point on which the board pivots when it changes direction.

#### Achieving Stability

It’s no wonder the Polynesian solution—dividing the hull into two (or three) units and placing them far apart—is attractive. With no penalty in weight, a catamaran or trimaran achieves huge righting moment at the slightest angle of heel.

However, that’s not the whole story. When stability is achieved entirely by righting moment from hull width (or by spreading the hulls farther apart), righting moment is typically very high at small angles of heel—but decreases steadily to nothing as the boat heels farther over. In one sense, when you need it most, it’s all gone; see Figure 8-06, right.

Conversely, the righting moment provided by fixed ballast is small as the hull begins to heel, but steadily increases as the hull heels farther; in other words, the boat is initially tender and ultimately stiff. When the heel angle nears 90 degrees, the mast is almost parallel with the surface of the water and the fixed ballast is almost sideways. At this radical heel angle, righting moment is at a maximum and heeling force at a minimum.

Keep in mind that these examples are highly simplified. Many other factors, such as the wave conditions present when such extreme heeling forces are at work, have to be considered by yacht designers. For example, even though the fixed-ballasted boat may not heel beyond this extreme angle, it may be filling itself with water. Even though the powerfully rigged, unballasted multihull may potentially capsize, it is less likely actually to founder (since, being unballasted, it is generally lighter than water).

### Boat Speed

Few activities inspire participants to seek the smallest improvement in speed as sailing does. Indeed, it is the potential for almost infinitesimal improvement that is one of the joys—and at times the frustration—of sailing.

Most sailors are not particularly concerned with going faster than any other sailboat—they’re more concerned with getting the most speed out of a sailboat that has been designed with speed-limiting rules. They want to maximize the potential of a boat that has been designed to sail within a class of boats that are all very much the same, if not actually identical in performance characteristics.

This historical limitation of sailboat design has led to a paradox: While sailors have developed the art of boat preparation, sail trim, and steering to a high degree of refinement, and yacht designers have squeezed every last fraction of a knot from conventional hulls, keels, and sails, the vast majority of sailboats have remained within a narrowly defined set of basic configurations. The imaginative application of pure science and engineering has not had much impact on the activities and experience of most sailors. Nevertheless, the principles that determine how fast a sailboat can go are eagerly studied and applied with an increasing degree of subtlety.

One of the chief enemies of speed for a sailboat, as for any vehicle traveling through a fluid—whether water or the atmosphere—is drag. But sailboats encounter two kinds of drag whose relative importance varies with speed. The first and most obvious is the drag caused by the friction of air and water flowing over large surfaces that can never be perfectly smooth. For that reason, yacht designers take great pains to reduce the wetted surface of the hull. For any given volume, the shape with the least wetted surface is a sphere (that’s why soap bubbles are spherical), but a sphere is not very useful for a hull. The next best compromise might be a round tube. Many hulls are developed from that principle and have almost a circular cross section.

Drag is also caused by turbulent flow around the awkward shapes of deck fittings, rigging attachments, through-hull fittings, and even the crew themselves. While attempts are made to streamline these, there are practical and rule-oriented limitations that most sailors happily accept.

Drag from friction and turbulence is most important at low speeds—not because it diminishes at higher speed (it doesn’t) but because on a conventional sailboat another form of drag becomes even more difficult to control. This is form drag, the process of energy loss through the formation of waves.

#### Hull Speed

Imagine a sailboat moving through the water at less than a knot. Tiny wavelets stream from the hull at several points along its waterline. They don’t seem to be connected. As speed increases, the wavelets grow into waves and seem to join, the trough of one running up into the crest of the next; see Figure 8-07, upper. At this point, you could measure the boat’s speed by measuring the distance between one wave crest and the next: The speed of a surface wave is strictly related to its length. To measure the relationship, in knots, of waves in water, yacht designers use the square root of the wave length, in feet, multiplied by 1.34.

Figure 8-07 When a hull moves through the water, it produces waves that result in energy loss. The maximum speed of a conventional displacement hull (upper) is a function of the longest wave that it can make, which in turn is determined by hull length. No amount of sail can create enough power for it to go faster. On the other hand, the planing hull (lower), such as a racing dinghy and some multihulls, can carry enough sail to push it over its own bow wave and onto a plane.

Three crests along the side of the boat indicate that it is traveling at about half of its maximum speed. As speed increases, the bow wave grows in height and length, pushing the midships wave aft. As the last fraction of a knot is reached, the stern wave is almost falling behind the hull—but it can’t. As the stern wave pulls aft, the stern settles down into it. Drag increases because the hull is actually inclined upward against the slope of the bow wave. The hull is trapped.

The implication is that you should always have enough propulsion power to climb over the bow wave and convert from a floating or displacement mode of support to a planing mode. That option is available to very light boats that can carry lots of sail (racing dinghies, multihulls, sailboards, and even foil-supported boats), but it’s not available within the realm of ballasted monohulls.

Therefore the implication for conventional boats is that as long as a hull is trapped in its own wave, the vessel will never go faster than the longest wave it can make. That is the reason why longer boats are faster—and why, almost from the beginning of sailboat racing, length has been heavily factored into rating rules.

The challenge, within the limitations of rules and economics, is to make a longer wave, so that the hull has a higher potential speed when the propulsion power (wind) is available, but to do so without seriously compromising the hull’s performance when windpower is scarce.

#### Designing for Speed

One common strategy is to design a hull that has two “personalities”—a shape that is relatively narrow and fine at the ends of the waterline when upright (at low speed when form resistance is less important), and a heeled, or high-speed, shape that is full at the ends. An overhang at the stern is very useful in this regard; as the stern wave builds, the waterline becomes longer and fuller, delaying the point at which the stern begins to settle down into the wave.

Obviously, this dual personality has limitations. In fact, if the designer has made the bow and stern of the boat especially fine so that they will be easier to push through the water, the waterline will actually seem short to the wave, and the top speed will be lower. This leads to the paradox that hulls meant to travel at or near hull speed most of the time tend to be rather full in the bow and the stern, while hulls expected to travel more slowly, while making more efficient use of lighter winds, might be finer fore and aft.

If heavy winds were always available on demand, and if sailboats always traveled with large apparent winds, yacht design would, of course, be much simpler. However, maximum driving power from a sailboat rig is rarely available, and conventional hulls therefore have to be designed in order to strike the best compromises.

Some very light sailboats, such as racing dinghies, are able to provide lots of propulsion power by having their crews hike out against the power of large sails; see Figure 8-08. Since they are short, these boats reach their wave-resistance limit at a very low speed (just over 5 knots). But they have lots of propulsion power still to absorb. Without much fuss, they rise over their bow waves and plane, just like powerboats, often reaching a significant 17 to 20 knots. Of course, it takes two heavy sailors and perhaps three straining sails to do it, but that’s all part of the attraction.

Figure 8-08 This multihull racing dinghy is moving at high speed on a plane, literally leaping out of the water. Its crew must “hike out” on a trapeze to keep the boat reasonably level.

#### Multihulls

Catamarans and trimarans, with their unique stability, also have physics on their side when it comes to making waves. Because their hulls can be so much narrower than a monohull, the waves they produce are consequently much smaller. While the relationship between wave length and speed still holds, the “hole in the water” that is created by the passage of a narrow hull is much smaller. The stern of a narrow hull doesn’t have so far to settle, and drag does not increase as much or as suddenly. In one sense, the narrow hull of a catamaran or a trimaran doesn’t have to plane because it has broken the hull-speed rule.

## THE PARTS OF A SAILING RIG

Technology has contributed many innovations to the art of sailmaking, mainly in the area of sail material. The woven polyester fiber, usually referred to by the trade name Dacron, that replaced canvas and cotton remains the most common of the new fibers. Nonetheless, in the constant quest for greater strength and less weight and stretch, Dacron has been joined by fabrics made of Mylar, Kevlar, Spectra, carbon fiber, Zylon, Vectran, and nylon for light sails.

With few exceptions (such as the spinnaker, discussed separately later), a conventional triangular shape has emerged as the most popular sail configuration. The luff of a mainsail is attached to the mast, while the foresail’s luff is attached to a forestay. While some mainsails are “loose footed” and attached only at the fore and aft corners (the tack and clew), more often they are attached along the length of the boom either by a boltrope sewn into the sail or by slides. Most foresails are loose footed. See Figure 8-09 for the parts of a sail; see Figure 8-10 for a representative range of sails.

Figure 8-09 A mainsail might seem to be a simple cloth triangle, but its construction is based on a complex mix of curves that the sailmaker uses to create the proper camber (i.e., belly, or shape). Commonly made of Dacron, the sail is reinforced at its edges and corners with patches of extra material, and given stiffness in the roach by battens.

Figure 8-10 A boat may carry sails of different sizes and weights to suit different conditions of wind velocity or points of sail. Shown here are the basic sails that a ketch might have on board. The largest jib, the one whose area extends beyond the triangle formed by the forestay, mast and deck (the foretriangle), is called a genoa. Though it is the largest headsail, the genoa is made of the lightest material to catch the slightest breezes. The storm jib, the smallest sail, is made of the heaviest material to withstand strong winds. The modern trend is to replace several headsails with one roller-furling sail that can be sized to match the wind velocity.

Sails are not flat like paper. They are carefully cut and assembled so as to present a subtle shape, curving both along their horizontal and their vertical lines. The quality of these curves and their ability to be slightly altered underway are what makes sailmaking such a competitive science. Not only must sailmakers design the right curves for each boat and for a variety of wind and wave conditions, they must also design a structure that will maintain its shape despite heavy stress and the effects of violent shaking and sunlight.

The largest stress on most sails, especially mainsails, is along the leech from the clew to the head. This unsupported edge has to accept the pull of the mainsheet and must also take the pressure of the wind flowing off its windward side. On almost all recent designs, the leech also carries a deep outward curve, a roach. To counter these loads, most sailmakers lay out the sail material so that the low-stretch fibers of the weave run parallel to the leech. That design dictates panels of material that slope down from leech to luff.

But many other patterns are in use as well. Some place different materials at high-stress areas of the sail, even going so far as to stitch and weld strong fibers in elaborate elliptical curves that radiate out from the foot and luff. At the other extreme are cruising sails that can easily be rolled onto furlers and have straight, soft leeches.

Battens provide additional support at the leech of a mainsail. Traditionally, they are flexible slats of wood or plastic that slide into long pockets. But that tradition is changing too. Catamaran sailors discovered that by extending battens from the leech all the way to the luff they could have a sail that would maintain a curve at very narrow angles to the oncoming airflow. Such sails have become popular even among cruising sailors who feel that, although they add extra weight, they are easier to manage and will last longer. Full-batten mains have led to a number of additional items of sail hardware to allow the forward end of the batten to be flexibly attached to the aft face of the mast, and so slide up and down freely despite the pressure.

Most sailors attach ribbons or pieces of wool to both sides of the sail; these telltales, or ticklers, indicate the efficiency of airflow over the sail. Often sailmakers sew windows of plastic near the telltales to make the action of a leeward one more visible. Large windows are sometimes sewn into dinghy mainsails and “deck-sweeping” foresails for better leeward visibility when racing or sailing in confined conditions.

Spinnakers, in all their variations, are usually made of nylon. Since spinnakers generate their drive from the push of the wind, they can be allowed to stretch, thereby taking full advantage of the ultimate strength and lightness nylon provides. However, the architecture of spinnakers is just as complicated as it is for other sails. The goal is to produce a very full camber, but one that still stands up to the flow of air from one edge to the other—spinnakers do not simply fill with air like a balloon. Lightness is a requirement to allow the sail to set high and away from the interference of the mainsail, and to present the largest possible area to the wind. The fact that spinnakers are usually colorful is a matter of tradition more than function, but it does mean they are easier to examine against a bright sky for fine-tuning the trim.

### Standing Rigging

Standing rigging is the structure designed to support the sails and to help transmit the power they develop to the hull. In most discussions, the mast itself is considered to be the main component of the standing rigging. The idea that the standing rigging is set up permanently and should not move (hence “standing”) has given way to high-performance engineering and tinkering. It is now fairly common to find standing rigging that is substantially altered while underway, and masts that are not only allowed, but forced, to bend. The distinction between standing and running rigging has begun to blur. Figure 8-11 illustrates the major components of standing rigging.

Figure 8-11 Standing rigging supports the sails and transmits to the hull the power that they develop. The most common arrangement is a mast supported by stays and shrouds. Running rigging includes halyards for hoisting the sails and sheets for trimming them.

#### Masts

The evolution of mast making has focused on attempts to increase strength while reducing weight aloft. The challenge to make the structure lighter and stronger is complicated by the fact that for any given sail area, more power can be extracted with a tall, narrow shape than with a short, wide one. The aspect ratio of sails (the relation between height and width) is limited by the fact that they become harder to trim as they get taller; but for purposes of performance under sail, masts can never be too tall or too thin—and are often extremely expensive.

Traditional wooden masts and booms have given way to extruded aluminum tubes and, more recently, to tubes made of composites of such materials as carbon fiber and epoxy. The simplest mast for a small, single-sail dinghy (such as the Laser) is a round aluminum tube held in a simple socket in the deck. The sail is attached to the mast by means of a sleeve extending the full height of the luff.

Although free-standing masts are sometimes used on larger sailboats (some even have more than one free-standing mast and sail-sleeve attachment), a much more common arrangement uses traditional stays and shrouds as guy wires from the mast to the deck. The mast may pass through the deck to rest on a step at the keel (keel-stepped) or fit into a step or tabernacle on deck (deck-stepped).

#### Stays & Shrouds

There are almost infinite configurations for stays and shrouds, but at the forward side, there is always a forestay (also known as a headstay) running from the bow (or near it) to the top of the mast (or near it). When the forestay is attached to a point below the top of the mast (called a fractional rig), the top of the mast can be pulled backward to create a slight bow shape. (The reasons for doing this are described in the section on sail trim.) There might also be a second forestay aft of the first, either for more precise control of mast bend or for carrying a smaller inner headsail, or staysail.

On high-performance rigs there might also be a jumper stay running from the mast, over a strut (jumper strut or diamond strut), and back to the mast at the top. Tension on this stay holds the mast tip against the pull of the mainsail leech, especially in a fractional rig.

A backstay, running from the mast tip (truck) to the stern, may be a single wire for its full length, or it may split into a bridle partway down and attach to the aft deck at both quarters. Splitting the backstay makes it easy to adjust its tension, because the bridle can be pulled together with a simple block and tackle; see Figure 8-12. The configuration also allows easier access to the cockpit over the transom.

Figure 8-12 Many small cruising sailboats adjust their backstay by pulling a choker (see arrow) downward over a Y-shaped bridle. Larger vessels usually use a hydraulic tensioning system.

Additional backstays are sometimes used on high-performance rigs, and are considered part of the running rigging because they can be loosened completely when underway. In fact, one has to be loosened and the other tightened on each tack or jibe; the windward running backstay is tensioned to add to mast stability, while the leeward one is slackened to allow the mainsail to be eased out. Needless to say, the cockpit of such a craft is a noisy, crowed place on each coming about.

Smaller boats may run shrouds directly from tangs (attachment fittings) on the mast to chainplates on the hull at or near the deck. Taller masts cannot use this simple arrangement because, to get the required angle between the shrouds and the mast, the attachment at the deck would have to be outboard of the hull. Instead, struts called spreaders provide needed support by giving a wider angle between the upper shrouds and the mast. They push the shrouds outward to maintain supporting pressure on the upper mast; see Figure 8-11.

Single spreaders extend athwartships from the mast a little more than halfway to the top. They are either horizontal or have a shallow upward angle. Some are swept back slightly. Smaller rigs get extra control over mast bend by swinging their spreader tips in a fore-and-aft arc. Larger boats often have multiple spreaders with several shrouds, each to a different level of the mast.

No matter what their arrangement, shrouds and stays are meant to keep the mast standing against the forces of wind and sails, or when the mast is deliberately bent, to change the shape of the mainsail.

Stays and shrouds on most sailboats are made of 1x19 stainless-steel wire of appropriate diameter for the size of the rig being supported. Stainless-steel rod, though more expensive, has been growing in popularity because it has less stretch and more resistance to corrosion than wire. Rod diameter required to provide the same tensile strength is smaller than that of stranded wire and so has less windage (surface exposed to the wind).

Integral to the strength of any piece of standing rigging is its attachment point at the deck. Usually, shrouds and stays terminate in turnbuckles that are attached to the eyes of chainplates, which in turn are bolted directly to the hull.

Tuning the standing rigging involves careful tightening of the shroud turnbuckles until the shrouds on both sides of the mast have the same tension, and the mast remains in column vertically with no sideways bends when the boat is sailing. Once the shrouds are tuned, backstay tension is adjusted by means of tackle or hydraulic pumps to increase or relieve forestay tension (see this page) and to match mast bend or mast rake to sailing conditions—see this page.

### Running Rigging

Running rigging includes all the gear used to raise and trim sails—and sometimes there is a bewildering amount of it. Many crews resort to color-coded lines to distinguish one piece of running rigging from another. Perhaps the easiest way to understand running rigging is to go through the sequence that most crews would follow to get underway. We will assume that the boat is a 25-foot (7.6m) cruising and racing sloop with a centerboard—a fairly common type.

If it’s not already attached to the boom, the first step is to pull the boltrope on the foot of the mainsail into the groove of the boom. The clew is pulled out to the end of the boom by hand and attached to a short wire called an outhaul, which will later be adjusted. (If there are slides attached to the sail, these are slid onto and along a track on the upper side of the boom.) The tack is attached to the gooseneck (the articulated fitting that couples boom to mast) by a short pin. Above the tack is another hole (a cringle) where another short adjusting line—the cunningham—may be attached. Some items of running rigging are illustrated in Figures 8-09 and 8-11.

Now, presuming the boat is ready to be cast off, or is already underway with engine running, the mainsail can be pulled to the top of the mast. This requires that the main halyard be shackled to the headboard of the main and that the luff boltrope be slid into the groove of the mast (there might be sail slides on a track instead). The halyard runs loosely up to the truck of the mast, over a sheave (a wheel) and back down the mast to the deck. It may simply be cleated to the mast, or it may run through a block (pulley) to a cleat or linestopper near the cockpit. Part of the halyard’s up-and-down journey may be inside the mast. Before the main is raised, a check is made to ensure that none of the lines attached to it will restrict the main on its way up the mast.

When the helmsman has headed the boat into the wind and gives the word, the halyard is hauled, the head of the main rises to the top of the mast, and the end of the halyard is cleated in place. Later, small adjustments may be made. With the main exposed to the wind, the sail flaps until the mainsheet is trimmed in. The mainsheet attaches near the end of the boom and controls the in-and-out position of the boom the way your arm controls the swing of a door. Now is also the time to make initial adjustments of the outhaul (and cunningham, if used); by tensioning the cloth along the edges, the position of the deepest part of the sail’s curve is controlled. After the tail of the main halyard is coiled and stowed, it might be necessary to ease the topping lift—a line or wire that supports the boom in a level position when the boat is at rest. Now the boom vang should be checked. This line, or telescoping pole, runs from the butt of the mast to the underside of the boom and resists the mainsail’s tendency to lift up the aft end of the boom. Of course, the mainsheet has a role to play here, too.

#### Selecting & Raising the Jib

Now it’s time to raise the headsail. First, the skipper chooses which one to raise. Bigger jibs are used in lighter winds. (Increasingly, especially on cruising sailboats, one or two roller-furling, roller-reefing headsails replace multiple headsails of various sizes.)

The tack of the headsail is attached by a short pin or a shackle to a point close to the bottom of the forestay. Some boats are equipped with a foil on the forestay, which contains a groove to hold the boltrope sewn into the jib’s luff. Otherwise, the foresail is attached to the stay with a series of hanks—spring-piston hooks. The headsail itself is loosely bundled on the foredeck; it may be necessary to tie it to the lifelines temporarily. The halyard is attached to the head and made ready to haul, then sheets must be attached to the clew. Unlike the mainsheet, these are normally stowed when not in use. The headsail sheets are best tied through the clew cringle and led back, one on each side of the boat, through their sheet blocks, or fairleads, and draped over the coaming of the cockpit. It’s important not to have them catch while the sail is being raised. (Sometimes, one long line is used for both sheets, attached to the clew at its midway point.)

When the word is given, the crew hauls the halyard and the headsail rises up the forestay. It luffs noisily for a few seconds while the halyard is cleated or stopped, then one of the sheets (depending on which tack the boat takes) is hauled in. Now, minor adjustments can be made to halyard tension and position of the jibsheet leads (which are often moveable fore and aft on a track).

Now the boat is fully under sail. The engine is turned off. The centerboard, very likely, is lowered completely, perhaps using a light winch with a crank for a boat this size. Smaller boats employ a block and tackle called a centerboard tackle, and very small boats have a simple pendant. Obviously, sailboats with a keel have no centerboard adjustment to make.

#### Adjusting the Sails

From this point, most sail adjustments take place from the cockpit, using the mainsail and headsail sheets. The position of the traveler—a car that moves on a track set athwartships on the boat to adjust the angle of pull on the mainsheet—also has to be set. Depending on many variables (refer to “Basic Sail Trim,” this page), the traveler car is pulled up to windward, let down to leeward, or positioned somewhere between; see Figure 8-13. Once it is fixed in place, frequent small adjustments are made to the mainsheet to account for changes in apparent wind speed and angle. These adjustments both position the boom laterally and release or apply tension to the leech. Racing crews use the traveler tackle to move the boom in or out without altering leech tension while sailing close to the wind.

Figure 8-13 Shown here on a small sailboat, a traveler is a car that slides on an athwartship track to aid in the proper adjustment of the mainsheet.

Likewise, the headsails are frequently adjusted—some crews would say too frequently. Jibsheet adjustments are made with a winch; see Figure 8-14. On boats larger than about 20 feet (6.1 m), even if the extra mechanical advantage of a winch crank is not necessary, the winch helps by snubbing the sheet until another handgrip is taken. When the wind increases, the headsail can hardly be moved without the mechanical advantage provided by the winch’s gear ratio. (Set aside winch handles carefully; they’re expensive and they sink.) Now, many headsail winches are fitted with a self-tailer, a circular jaw that holds enough tension on the sheet to prevent it from slipping against the surface of the winch drum. As the sheet is cranked in, the tail is peeled out of the jaw automatically. This means sail trim can be accomplished by one person instead of two. For cruising, this is progress; for racing, it means less work for the crew.

Figure 8-14 On all but the smallest sailboats, winches are used to provide mechanical advantage for trimming the headsail sheets. Most modern winches are now equipped with self-tailing devices so that a single crewmember can handle the winch.

The sails on a 25-foot (7.6 m) boat are fairly easy to raise without the help of winches, but a larger boat might have a halyard winch, either mounted at the foot of the mast, or, more commonly, on the aft end of the roof of the cabin. Since winches are expensive, they are often shared among halyards and other adjusting lines. To hold one line in place while another is being winched, boats may have linestoppers—simple levered clutches that clamp onto the line without damaging it. These are arranged, one per line, in front of the shared winch.

In place of linestoppers, lines may be held by camcleats with spring-loaded jaws that permit line to run in but not out. Mainsheets, with their load-reducing block and tackle to provide mechanical advantage, are almost always held by large camcleats, but camcleats are otherwise more common on small boats or for smaller, lightly loaded adjusting lines on large boats. Line is released by lifting up and out of the jaws.

Ordinary horned cleats are also useful for sheets, although they are less and less common for running rigging. Used properly, cleats can provide perfect holding power and quick release. (Refer to Chapter 23 for more information on cleating.)

So far we have explored all the line and hardware needed to get the sails up, adjust their shape, change their angle in relation to the apparent wind, and pull the centerboard up and down. We’ve pulled on the backstay, moved the traveler car, and positioned the headsail leads. The next step—flying the spinnaker—perplexes and intimidates novices.

### Flying the Spinnaker

For this discussion, we will assume a conventional spinnaker because the other styles are simplifications of it. The spinnaker is attached at three points—the head and the clews. (Note that spinnakers have two clews, although some sailors may logically refer to the windward clew as the tack.) The head is attached to the mast by a halyard, just like other headsails. The clews are attached to the deck with sheets, just like all headsails—except that there are always two separate sheets. The uniqueness of a conventional spinnaker is that it is symmetrical, so that one sheet and one luff are on the windward side of the spinnaker on one tack, but on the leeward side on the other tack. As they change sides, they may change names.

The leeward side of the spinnaker is the simplest. A sheet is attached to the clew; it runs aft to a block on the deck and is trimmed with a winch. When the spinnaker luffs, you pull the sheet in. The windward side is more complicated. Here, the clew also attaches to a sheet that runs aft to the deck at the stern. In this position, on the windward side, the sheet is now called the guy—though it’s still the same piece of line. However, it is held away from the mast by a spar—a spinnaker pole—jutting out at right angles and attached to the mast with an articulated coupling. The outboard end of the pole has a piston hook (or a similar device) that the guy runs through. The spinnaker itself is not actually attached to the pole.

That sounds simple, except that the pole has to be held both up and down. This is done with a pole uphaul and downhaul running from the pole (or a bridle on the pole) to the mast. Both up- and downhaul need their own blocks and, sometimes, winches. The loads created by the spinnaker can be heavy and variable.

For the cruising sailor, the chief advantage of the asymmetrical spinnaker is that so much of this spinnaker gear is eliminated. Asymmetry does away with the two clews and the sheets that change names. The cruising spinnaker is really a larger, lighter headsail that is tacked and jibed much the same way as a normal headsail, but is not attached along the forestay. Instead, it flies freely away from the forestay.

The racing approach to asymmetrical spinnakers is a little different. A pole is still used, but it has become a telescoping bowsprit. The spinnaker is typically not flown directly downwind (because these new, light boats sail fastest by tacking downwind), but is flown like a headsail, even though it is as big and almost as round as a conventional reaching spinnaker.

## BASIC SAIL TRIM

With practice, and by noting the results during trial and error experimentation, helmsman and crew will develop a feel for a boat’s characteristics in different conditions and take appropriate measures to keep it “in the groove.” Sail trim is a major component of achieving that goal, whether or not you are racing. The following are some elementary aspects of sail trim on each point of sail.

### Sail Shape

To some degree, the shape of a sail is restricted to the amount of camber designed into it by the sailmaker. But the depth of the camber (draft) can be controlled, and the position of the deepest part of the draft, with respect to the luff of the sail, can also be controlled; see Figure 8-15. A more familiar, and eminently changeable, element of sail trim is the angle of attack—the angle at which the sail meets the apparent wind.

Figure 8-15 Changing the shape of a sail is accomplished by changing the depth of the draft to produce a flatter or fuller sail. The amount of draft required in different conditions varies with the point of sailing. In general, flatter sails (upper) are more efficient upwind than fuller ones (lower).

As discussed in the preceding section on sailboat parts, a host of controls is available for trimming and shaping the sails for the conditions encountered. Be forewarned, however: There are no hard and fast rules for the order or degree with which each is used. Observation of the telltales on the sails and instruments in the cockpit, ability to hold a desired course, and the “feel” of the helm all measure the success of each action or combination of actions. Moreover, actions that produce a positive response on one boat may not produce the same response on another. But if experimentation is the rule of sail trim, there are some fundamentals worth learning.

### Mainsail Trim

Changing the shape of the mainsail involves changing the depth of the draft to produce a flatter or fuller sail. Moving the mainsail’s draft forward or aft is also a factor in improving the balance of the boat. Most of the time, the ideal position for maximum draft is one-third to one-half the way back from the mast. When sailing upwind, the object is to make the sail fuller at the leading edge, to direct total lift force forward and reduce side forces. When reaching, draft position is usually farther aft. Tensioning the clew outhaul to pull the clew aft reduces draft and moves it forward. The same effect is achieved by tensioning the backstay and boom vang to bend the top of the mast aft and bow the middle of the mast forward. As the mast bows forward, it pulls the middle of the mainsail and flattens it out; see Figure 8-16. Increasing halyard tension and taking up on the cunningham are also effective measures to move draft forward.

Figure 8-16 Using the backstay to tension the top of the mast aft will bow the middle of the mast forward, and so flatten a mainsail. The effect is to reduce draft and move it forward.

The mainsheet, combined with the boom vang and traveler, controls the tension on the leech of the mainsail. Leech tension is important for several reasons, but the two principal considerations are twist and trailing-edge shape.

In general, wind flows faster with increasing height above the water. That means that the top of a sail should be trimmed to a different angle than the bottom, with the greater angle at the top—hence sail twist; see Figure 8-17. To achieve a high degree of twist, you would usually ease the mainsheet, allowing the boom to rise. You might have to pull the traveler car to windward to prevent the boom from swinging too far from the boat’s centerline. The boom vang would be slack.

Figure 8-17 Because wind speed is greater aloft than at deck level, sails need to be trimmed to a wider angle at the top than at the bottom. Sail twist is achieved by easing the mainsheet, allowing the boom to rise (far left). To remove twist (near left), trim the mainsheet in, and use the traveler to position the boom slightly farther off the boat’s centerline.

The opposite effect, removing twist, is achieved by trimming harder on the mainsheet, placing more tension up the leech, easing the traveler car to leeward to position the boom somewhat away from the boat’s centerline, and using a tight boom vang. More pressure is carried high and aft by the mainsail, and the leech “closes up”—begins to push airflow away to windward instead of just letting it flow easily aft.

While the coarse setting of leech tension might be matched to the average wind strength and the point of sail, gusts and lulls may require further fine-tuning with the mainsheet. Typically, the mainsheet is tensioned in lulls and eased (or even released) to open the leech and depower the sail in gusts. Upwind, the mainsheet usually provides most of the leech control. Off the wind or on a reach, when the main is eased, the vang controls the leech. Many sails also have a leechline and a small cleat built into them to provide fine control as an adjunct to the coarse control of the mainsheet and vang. Care must be taken that the leechline is not so tight as to hook the leech to windward.

The traveler, of course, provides a means of balancing the mainsheet’s vertical and horizontal pull on the boom. As the mainsheet is eased and the boom moves to leeward, the angle of pull on the boom becomes more horizontal, removing tension from the leech. When the traveler car is eased to leeward, the pull of the mainsheet becomes more vertical, increasing leech tension.

The traveler car can also be pulled to windward in light air so that the mainsheet tension remains more horizontal when the boom is close to or right over the centerline of the boat. This allows sufficient twist with a smaller angle of attack. However, care must be taken not to overtrim the main. A rule of thumb is to keep the batten second from the top parallel to the boom; no battens—in fact, no part of the sail—should ever point to windward.

##### THE POINTS OF SAILING

When a boat is sailing as close as it can to the direction from which the wind is blowing, the boat is said to be “close-hauled,” meaning that its sails are hauled in close to the hull. Another name for this is “beating.”

When the angle between heading and wind direction is increased, the boat begins to “close reach,” and when the angle is about 90°, the wind is on the beam, so the boat is “beam reaching.”

Further increases in angle bring the boat to a “broad reach”; with the wind almost directly aft, the boat is “running.”

The term “running” sounds fast, and in square-riggers, it may well have been. But the fastest point of sail for most modern boats is a close reach, and running is slow by comparison.

Remember that this diagram shows the relation between a boat and the true wind, while the more important factor, especially for today’s faster boats, is the relationship between a boat and its apparent wind—the wind that the sails feel. Very fast boats, like catamarans and racing dinghies, might seem to be swinging from a close reach right through to a broad reach in terms of the true wind, when they are in fact close reaching the apparent wind. Sails are trimmed to the apparent wind, not the true wind.

A sailboat cannot sail directly into the eye of the wind, but modern sailboats can sail to within 45° of the wind, or closer, when close-hauled. A reach is the fastest point of sail, with the sails eased partway out. A run is aerodynamically simpler but can be the most dangerous point of sail. The sails are extended as far out over the sides of the boat as possible and can swing across with tremendous force.

### Headsail Trim

The headsail, or jib, of many boats supplies as much drive as the main, or more. Not only are headsails often as large as the main, especially in masthead rigs with genoas, but the sail is presented to a clean airflow that is undisturbed by mast windage.

The tension on the forestay is the second most important control of the headsail shape after sheet position and tension.

A loose forestay (created by loosening the backstay) creates sag, which in turn creates a full (deep draft) headsail. Sailmakers build a degree of allowance for forestay sag into the sail shape, but increasing tension in the forestay has the same effect as straightening the mast: The sail is pulled tighter across the middle and becomes flatter.

Upwind, particularly in brisk winds, the jib halyard should be tensioned in order to keep the position of the deepest part of the draft as far forward as possible.

Key to trimming the jib, however, is the position of the clew. As the leeward sheet is eased, the clew will tend to move outboard and upward. The effect is a fuller sail. Tensioning the sheet pulls the clew aft, down, and inboard, flattening the sail and decreasing the angle of attack with the airflow.

Twist in the headsail is controlled by the position of the sheet lead (also known as the fairlead). As the lead is moved forward, the sheet pulls more on the leech—more downward. But as the lead is moved aft, the sheet pulls more on the foot—more backward.

In practice, it is often difficult to see the angle of the jibsheet accurately. But if the leech is fluttering, it indicates that the fairlead is too far aft, creating too much twist at the top of the sail; if the foot of the sail is fluttering or bellied out too far, the fairlead is too far forward, flattening the top of the sail too much.

#### Telltales

The most effective sail trim is often elusive, even for experienced sailors. Yet while no one can actually see the wind, there remains a relatively simple solution: Place pieces of ribbon or yarn about eight or nine inches long—telltales—at or near the luff on both sides of the headsail, and sometimes also on the mainsail. Their movement will reveal the action of the wind; see Figure 8-18. Jib telltales can serve to fine-tune sheet lead position and sheet tension. Although telltale positions will vary with preference, in general three telltales are placed on the jib about a foot behind the luff so that they divide the luff into four roughly equal sections. (It’s a good idea to avoid placing telltales too close to seams. It can be frustrating when they become caught on stitching in light air.)

Figure 8-18 Telltales on a sail’s luff stream aft on both sides of the sail (dashed line is to leeward) when airflow is even and smooth (upper). A lifting windward telltale when you’re sailing close-hauled (middle) indicates that you’re pinching (heading too close to the wind). A stalled or fluttering leeward telltale (lower) indicates that you’re not heading high enough.

Some sailors also favor telltales at the point of maximum draft on their mainsail, and one at each batten pocket along the leech, in addition to three telltales at the luff positioned as for the jib. Headsail luff telltales are uniquely useful because they “read” undisturbed airflow.

In general, the object when trimming a sail or steering close-hauled is to have all the telltales streaming aft at the same time, indicating that the airflow across the two sides of the sail is even and smooth. If the leeward jib telltales are lifting or fluttering, they indicate that the boat can be steered closer to the apparent wind because the airflow is hitting the edge of the sail and tipping over it, resulting in a curl. If it is not necessary or even desirable to steer closer to the wind—if the boat is not sailing upwind, but reaching—the same corrective effect can be achieved by letting the sail out. The leading edge of the sail thus meets the airflow more smoothly, and as a consequence the telltales stream aft.

Conversely, if a windward jib telltale lifts and flutters, the boat is too close to the apparent wind and must be laid off, or steered at a wider angle to the apparent wind. If a course change is not desirable, the airflow can be corrected by pulling the sheet tighter and the sail closer to the boat’s centerline.

If the telltales nearer the foot of the sail (usually the headsail) are acting differently from the telltales nearer the head, then there is something wrong with the amount of twist. The sheet lead position should be changed until the telltales all react in a similar manner to changes in steering angle or sheet tension. For example, if the upper windward telltales are lifting while the lower ones are streaming, this is an indication that the sail has too much twist and the leads should be moved forward.

Fluttering or drooping telltales on the leech of the mainsail indicate that the air leaving the after edge is curling, creating drag; this is created by loosening of the leech tension, known as opening up the leech. This drag can be reduced or eliminated by tightening the leech.

#### The Slot

The mainsail and the headsail work very closely together to shape the air that flows between them. This area between the sails is called the slot. The headsail accelerates the air across the leeward surface of the main, helping it produce lift and substantially enhancing the low-pressure venturi effect.

If the jibsheet is eased, it permits the clew to rise and go too far outboard. The slot may become too open, so that there is no accelerated flow. If the jib is sheeted too tightly, the slot closes and the jib forces airflow to curl into the back of the main—backwinding the main and destroying the low pressure that is the whole object of the trimming. (Sometimes this backwinding is acceptable if there is too much airflow and sufficient power is being taken from the headsail while the main acts to balance the pressures fore and aft to control steering.)

The jib should generally be trimmed for course and conditions first, then the main trimmed so that the twist of its leech matches that of the jib, making the slot effective. On an upwind course, jib and main are usually trimmed as close to the centerline as wind force will permit. On some boats, a second fairlead track, or barber-haul system, permits the headsail sheet lead to be positioned closer to or farther from the centerline, as well as fore and aft, with much the same effect as adjusting the mainsheet traveler.

#### Other Rigs

When measured against the relatively complex rigging of conventional sailboats, the popularity of wishbone cat rigs is easy to understand; see Figure 8-19, far right. One sail does all the work and is controlled, for the most part, by one line—the mainsheet. The wishbone boom is suspended at its forward end by a choker line that attaches to a block on the mast and leads down to the foot of the mast and back to the cockpit. At its aft end, it is suspended, like a conventional boom, by the sail. The tightness or looseness of the choker line determines the depth or shallowness of the curve of the main in somewhat the same way that a conventional outhaul does.

Figure 8-19 Very small sailboats may have a variety of rigs as shown here. Most commonly seen is the lateen rig, used on board boats such as the Sunfish, and the wishbone rig used on board sailers. The rigs shown above are in addition to the common Marconi and gaff rigs.

Very small sailboats may have a variety of rigs, as shown in Figure 8-19.

### Upwind Techniques

The closer to the wind a boat sails, the less distance it must travel to reach an upwind destination. But it also sails slower. Conversely, the farther off the wind it sails, the faster the boat moves. But it must sail a greater distance; see Figure 8-20.

Figure 8-20 Sailing upwind requires consideration of several factors, including wind speed, wave conditions, and desired level of comfort. In the example above, any of the three routes shown will lead to the same destination, but with probable different times of arrival.

The objective of sailing upwind (variously called pointing, beating, or sailing close-hauled or to weather) is to reach a specific point as quickly as possible by sailing a course that strikes the best compromise between higher speed and longer distance on the one hand, and lower speed but shorter distance on the other. The exact best compromise changes with wind speed and wave conditions.

In general, flatter sails are more efficient upwind than are full ones; refer to Figure 8-15. They also should be sheeted as close to the centerline as the wind strength will allow. The crew should be prepared to depower sails during gusts—either by easing the traveler car to leeward or by easing the mainsheet—so that excessive heeling doesn’t contribute to leeway. Positioning crew to windward and even asking them to hike over the side will also help to counter heeling, thus allowing the keel to produce more lift and less leeway.

Constant adjustment of sails is called for in alternating gusts and lulls when close-hauled. Alternatively, the helmsman can pinch up in puffs and gusts, temporarily depowering the sails and keeping the boat on its feet (albeit at a temporary loss of speed), and bear off in lulls to accelerate.

Sailing close-hauled, the helmsman must determine how well the boat is balanced. If too much weather helm is required to keep the boat sailing a straight course, the center of effort has moved too far aft or the boat has heeled too much. To balance the boat, the sails can be depowered (flattened), the mainsail leech can be opened up, the boom can be eased out away from the centerline, or all three.

To sail a windward course well, a crew must deal with several trade-offs. Factors such as wind strength, the possibility of a wind shift, sea conditions, strain on the boat, and crew comfort (and in a race, how the competition is doing) must be weighed in order to set a course that efficiently and economically moves the boat toward the target.

##### TACKING

Since a boat cannot set a direct course to a destination to windward, it must tack upwind. Each new tack will be more or less perpendicular to the previous one, so the helmsman can calculate ahead of time what the compass heading of the new tack is likely to be.

A well-crewed boat should be able to tack smoothly. In preparation, the helmsman announces “Ready about,” and bears off the wind a few degrees to add speed. The windward headsail sheet, which is not yet in use, is prepared with a clockwise turn or two around the windward winch, while the leeward sheet, which is under load, is uncleated but kept on the winch, ready to free. The winch handle should be at hand. If the traveler car is to windward, the crew member assigned to the mainsheet readies the car to be moved.

Once the boat and crew are readied, the helmsman announces, “Helms a’lee” or “Coming about” and smoothly turns up into the wind, ensuring that the rudder is not cranked over so hard as to stall the boat.

When the headsail begins to luff, the leeward sheet is cast off. As the bow turns through the eye of the wind, the headsail trimmer keeps the slack out of the new working sheet but does not trim it too hard or too much while the headsail is still luffing across the foredeck. As the turn continues and the bow falls off toward the new tack, the new leeward sheet is hauled in by hand until taut, then wrapped two more times around the winch. The winch handle is inserted for final trimming. The helmsman stops the turn about 95 or 100° from the previous heading, then lets the boat gather speed as the mainsheet trimmer moves the traveler and trims the main to complement the trim of the headsail. The baseline heading on the new tack will be about 90° from the previous one, and 45° to the true wind on the new windward bow. But the helmsman should allow the boat to accelerate slightly off the wind before sails are trimmed perfectly and the boat is steered up to the desired heading.

The boat begins to tack at the bottom figure. Sails begin to luff as the bow heads into the wind. Momentum carries the boat onto the new tack (in this case, the starboard tack), and the sails are then trimmed.

#### Reaching Technique

Bearing away from a close-hauled course onto a reach puts most boats onto their fastest point of sailing. But caution must be taken whenever this maneuver is put into practice—continued care is required in order to maintain the boat’s balance. Weather helm, as the boat tries to round up into the wind, is usually strongest on a close reach, because an over-trimmed main will tend to keep the center of effort back and to twist the boat into the wind.

Moving the main traveler to leeward will change the mainsail’s angle of attack and ease heeling. But while main and jib should be trimmed for the course and wind strength, care must be taken that the main isn’t eased so far that wind strikes its lee side too directly and stalls the boat. In centerboard boats, it helps to raise the board slightly to move the center of lateral resistance aft and more in line with the center of effort. A skilled crew might wish to cope with gusts by alternately easing and sheeting sails. But the helmsman should bear in mind that the rule that applied when close-hauled is now the opposite: When reaching, bear off in gusts and head up in lulls. It is essential to bear off because, as boat speed increases, the apparent wind moves forward. In a light boat, a quick jab to leeward will also help to “put the hull under the sails” and stabilize it momentarily.

In order to keep the rudder “biting” when reaching in heavy weather, crew weight should be aft and to windward. This is especially important in a following or quartering sea, because waves moving under the hull from behind can lift the stern and rudder out of the water, causing the boat to yaw with a momentary loss of steerage. But a helmsman who learns to steer the waves can often surf down them and exceed theoretical hull speed, one of the most exhilarating experiences in sailing. The boom vang should be used to adjust the curve of the leech and control the boom.

Reaching in very light conditions calls for different tactics. Moving crew weight forward and to leeward induces heel, making the sails “fall” to leeward and giving them a better airfoil shape to utilize what little airflow exists.

#### Offwind Technique

Sailing off the wind can be a pleasant respite after a long beat or reach. More sail may be carried because the apparent wind is not as strong. On the other hand, downwind sailing is not usually as fast as other points of sail, and unless caution is taken it can be the most dangerous point of sail; see sidebar, “Jibing,” this page.

Bearing off a reach onto a straight downwind course, ease the main as far out as possible. If possible, ease tension on the backstay (and the leeward running backstay, if so equipped) for a fuller shape in the headsail. Sufficient tension on the upwind running backstay may be applied to give extra support to the mast. Most sailors prefer to broad reach downwind, jibing toward the target rather than sailing dead downwind. This is usually preferable for a light, fast boat. But even broad reaching, the narrowest angle toward the target may be best. And unless the wind comes slightly over one quarter, a jib will become blanketed by the main’s wind shadow. To put the headsail in clear air, it can be jibed across to the other tack so the boat is sailed goosewinged (wing-and-wing), with the lee side of both sails 90 degrees to the wind.

Maintaining steady wind on a boomless headsail when goosewinged is often a problem. The remedy is a whisker pole extended from a fitting on the mast to the clew of the headsail—the precursor of the spinnaker pole. Some long-distance sailors, if sure that the wind won’t shift, and reluctant to deal with the extra care a spinnaker requires, go so far as to fly two boomed headsails at once, one on each side, often with the main reefed or furled altogether.

Whenever the boom is outboard of the boat (sometimes when reaching and always when running), the mainsheet has less downward pull. In heavier weather downwind, waves may cause the boom to rise and fall as the boat rolls. Tightening the boom vang will help steady the boat. The mainsail may be at right angles to the centerline of the boat, but if the boom is allowed to move too far forward, the boat will be sailing by the lee (see “Jibing,” opposite page).

#### The Dangers of Jibing

If there is a danger that the wind might catch the leech of the main and cause a flying jibe (uncontrolled), a preventer can be rigged. The mast attachment of a tackle type of boom vang can be moved farther outboard, toward the toerail. In heavy seas, however, care must be taken that the boom, which is held down by the vang, doesn’t dip into the water as the boat rolls. Furthermore, too much tension on the vang may result in over-flattening the mainsail. To maintain sail shape, the topping lift and vang can always be adjusted in concert.

While a vang attached to the toerail will partially prevent the main from filling on its leeward side and jibing accidentally, it may also cause damage to the rigging if you do jibe uncontrollably. A better, perhaps safer, preventer can be rigged from the clew of the main to a block on the foredeck and led to the cockpit, where it can be eased if necessary.

In general, crew weight when sailing off the wind should be amidships fore and aft, and as far outboard as possible on both sides. In fresh conditions (17-21 knots) when a following sea is lifting the stern of the boat, moving weight aft is a measure that will help maintain steerage.

When sailing downwind, it is important to remember that wind strength is greater than it seems. Before hardening up to a reach, sails should be tended accordingly, perhaps even changed or reefed if the boat will be over-canvassed for the new point of sail.

### Spinnakers

Sailors who wish to achieve maximum speed when sailing off the wind most often turn to a spinnaker. Perhaps no sail has as many variations as the spinnaker (often called “chute” or “kite”). Sails that fall into the category are often called flying sails, as they are attached to the boat only at their three corners and do not have the stabilizing support at the luff that other headsails do; refer to Figure 8-21.

The chute is constructed of lightweight material (usually nylon) that fills easily, packs in a small launching bag or box, and is cut to billow with a full shape and curved luff and leech. Contrary to popular view, a spinnaker does not merely catch wind from behind to “push” the boat. Rather, air passing over its leeward side from luff to leech creates a mini low-pressure area into which the sail moves.

For the most part, spinnakers fall into one of two categories: conventional and asymmetrical. A conventional symmetrical spinnaker (luff and leech are of equal lengths and interchangeable) is more efficient directly downwind than asymmetrical models.

Before it is launched, care must be taken that the spinnaker has been properly packed with no twists, and that the head and two corners of the foot of the sail are accessible, preferably color-coded for port (red) and starboard (green).

Assuming that the spinnaker is being launched on the port side, clip the inboard end of the spinnaker pole to the mast eye, with the pole sticking out the starboard (windward) side. Adjust the mast end to the height at which it is anticipated that the pole will be held when the sail is set.

The guy is run forward from its turning block near the cockpit, outside the starboard shrouds, through the pole end (still on deck or lower than the pole end attached to the mast) and around the forestay, then clipped to the green-patched (starboard) spinnaker clew. The sheet is attached to the red-patched port clew, then led outside the port shrouds and aft to its turning block on the port quarter. The halyard is attached to the head of the sail by means of a swiveling shackle. The spinnaker should be flown from a mast block that is above and ahead of the forestay.

Raise the spinnaker pole using the pole uphaul lift until it is at right angles to the mast. Take up the pole downhaul and cleat it, leaving just a little slack.

Before raising the sail, ensure that the pole is a few feet from the forestay and pay out some of the sail so that the tack is allowed to reach the end of the pole as the guy is tensioned and cleated.

Finally, hoist the spinnaker and cleat the halyard. If the headsail is still flying, it is now lowered and secured on deck (or roller-furled). As the spinnaker fills, trim the sheet and guy, first positioning the guy (and the pole with it) according to the apparent wind angle. The pole should be (very roughly) at a right angle (90°) to the apparent wind; see Figure 8-21.

Figure 8-21 “Flying” a spinnaker off the wind can be a breathtaking experience. This powerful sail demands skill and constant attention.

##### JIBING

Uncontrolled jibes are to be avoided, as they are hard on gear and a fast-moving boom is potentially dangerous to personnel on deck. A controlled jibe, however, should be a normal part of sailing and is not something to be feared. When ready to jibe, the helmsman announces “Prepare to jibe” and steers slightly off the wind. The mainsheet trimmer hauls the sheet in and cleats it as other crew release the leeward headsail sheet and haul in the windward sheet.

The helmsman then resumes the turn until the boom swings across the boat and is held by the cleated mainsheet. The mainsheet is then eased to the new windward side as the headsail is trimmed for the new course.

In the diagram at right, the boat is already sailing goosewinged (also called wing-and-wing), with the mainsail on the port side and the jib to starboard. The helmsman prepares to jibe the mainsail, turning the stern into the wind (bottom). The wind then catches the mainsail and whips it across the boat (middle), under control of the mainsheet. The boat can continue with the jib still to starboard (top), or the jib can be winged-out to port.

If the wind were coming over the port quarter rather than the starboard quarter of the boat in its initial position with mainsail set to port, the boat would be sailing by the lee, which can allow the wind to get behind the sail and slam it forcefully across the deck—an uncontrolled jibe. A helmsman must guard against this danger when sailing downwind.

#### Sailing the Chute

The primary rule of spinnaker sailing is to keep the luff from curling and the pole as square as possible to the wind. The closer the course is to dead downwind, the farther aft the pole is pulled and the more the sheet is eased to add to sail fullness. In some cases, the halyard may be eased slightly as well to permit the spinnaker to move forward, out of the disturbance from the main.

To reach, allow the pole to move forward, and trim the sheet. Care must be taken that the pole doesn’t rest on the forestay; the power of a spinnaker is such that forestay damage is possible. A spinnaker is also capable of heeling the boat dramatically. The helmsman must bear off in gusts and “keep the hull under the chute.”

To jibe the chute, begin by swinging the main boom across the centerline. Next, unclip the pole at the mast and, using the remote line to open the pole-end fitting, clip the former mast end over the sheet, which is to become the new guy. The final maneuver consists in attaching the former outboard pole end to the mast eye and trimming the former guy, which at this point becomes the sheet.

An alternative “dip-pole” jibe requires either a pole that fits inside the forestay or one that can be retracted in such a way that allows it to do so. Throughout, the mast end remains attached to the mast. During the jibe, the guy is released by the remote trip line, the pole is retracted if necessary, and the pole topping lift is released in order to permit the pole to be dipped below and behind the forestay. Finally, the pole end is then clipped onto the former sheet, which now becomes the new guy, and the new sheet (which formerly was the guy) is hauled in and trimmed.

#### Dousing the Chute

The surest way of bringing down (dousing) the spinnaker is first to depower by steering so that the spinnaker is blanketed by the main when the guy is eased forward. The foredeck crew unclips the guy from the pole using the remote trip line, and the guy is eased. The sail, now held by the halyard and sheet, essentially becomes a large flag. Taking care not to let the sheet or guy fall into the water, one crewmember eases the halyard while another gathers the sail by the leech, under the main boom. With practice, it is possible to gather it directly into the storage “turtle,” leaving the two lower corners and head exposed and ready for rehoisting.

#### Cruising Spinnakers

From the foregoing, it isn’t hard to see why conventional spinnakers are often eschewed by cruising sailors who sail short-handed. But all sailors seek to improve downwind performance, and the asymmetrical spinnaker, often called a cruising chute, is viewed by many as the cruiser’s answer. For reaching in particular, asymmetrical spinnakers, distinguished by a luff that is shorter than the leech, are also gaining favor with racers.

In the cruising form, a line at the tack is led through a block at the stemhead and run back to the cockpit cleat or stopper. The sheets are usually run outside the forestay. Sailing under a cruising chute is much like reaching, though easing the sheets by easing the tack line, and perhaps the halyard, brings the sail forward and free of the main’s shadow.

Jibing a cruising chute inside the forestay as one would a conventional foresail risks wrapping the halyard around the forestay as well as damaging the large sail on foredeck fittings. Consequently, a cruising chute is usually jibed by letting the sheet go as the stern comes through the wind. The clew of the sail is allowed to fly free around the front of the headstay, and the new sheet on the opposite side is taken up so that (unlike a conventional spinnaker) the reverse side of the chute is now the leeward side.

The asymmetrical chute’s effectiveness decreases as the boat sails more downwind. Only in very light conditions should it be poled out like a genoa. However, it is often better than a symmetrical spinnaker for close reaching. A growing trend among larger racing yachts, including those in the America’s Cup competition, has been adapted from racing dinghies such as the International 14 class. This system features a permanently mounted pole that can be extended forward through the hull at the bow to become a long sprit (like a bowsprit). Attaching the asymmetrical chute to the pole end means effective exposure to the wind when reaching.

Yet another variation on the spinnaker theme is the so-called gun-mount spinnaker system, which features a pole mounted at its middle on the fitting of a reinforced pulpit. The sail is tacked at both ends of the pole and the pole acts as a boom. Sheets to each end of the pole are used to trim the sail according to the course.

## BOAT HANDLING UNDER SAIL

In most, but not all, situations a sailboat will be under auxiliary engine power when maneuvering in close quarters, such as leaving a berth and coming back in, anchoring, or picking up a mooring. But if for any reason mechanical power is not available, a skipper must be able to carry out the required maneuver under sail power alone.

The wind that propels a sailboat can also be used to put on the brakes. That’s why a skipper who wants to slow down or stop will begin by spilling the wind from the boat’s sails (letting them out), then will point the bow of the craft into the direction from which the wind is coming. The whole rig, acting as windage, will slow the boat down, stop it, and eventually force it backward.

### Docking & Undocking Under Sail

In most instances a day’s sail will begin and end at a pier or wharf, or perhaps from a berth in a slip. The first situations are not too great a problem; departing from a slip can be more difficult.

#### Departing a Pier Under Sail

Frequently, the wind and current will permit a straightforward departure from a pier even under sail. When everyone is on board and all gear is stowed, sails should be readied for hoisting, with the halyards attached.

If the wind will help move the boat from the pier, it is a simple matter to take in the dock lines and raise the first sail. This is usually the mainsail. The boat will be maneuverable as soon as the sail is hoisted and sheeted properly, provided there is sufficient wind; steerageway may be gained by a shove-off or along the pier. Other sails may be raised later, when clear of the pier; see Figure 8-22.

Figure 8-22 Leaving a pier under sail power alone must be done with due caution. Here the crew is about to unfurl and then sheet in the jib, and the boat should gather way and begin to sail. Care should be taken that the boat does not drift back into the pier.

If the wind or current is pushing the boat onto the pier, departure may be more difficult. In extreme conditions, when it is rough or windy and therefore impossible to position the boat for a safe departure from the end of a pier, then either another boat or an anchor set to windward will be needed to pull the boat away from the pier.

#### Coming into a Pier Under Sail

Using the wind to slow down and eventually stop a sailboat is a technique that is useful for landing at a pier or wharf; see Figure 8-23. Providing that you can choose an “approach path” that heads the boat into the wind, you can sail across the wind, round up, and, as the boat slows, guide it gently into position for docking.

Figure 8-23 Arriving at a pier under sail requires practice to prevent crash landings. In the light breeze shown here, the mainsail can be left up and allowed to luff completely. Usually, however, it is wiser to douse all sails just before reaching the pier, in case an unexpected puff of wind comes up to fill the sails.

In stronger winds, everything is noisier and more exciting, but the braking action is also greater. It can be further strengthened if the crew pushes the boom outward against the wind as the boat is headed up. This is called backing the main.

Careful crew work and a little practice will allow a skipper to judge just how far the boat will carry on as the braking force of the wind is applied. Some skippers claim that they can even back down into a slip but, in a marina, this maneuver should be reserved for emergencies.

When approaching a pier or wharf for a landing under sail, the jib may be dropped some distance away, according to the skipper’s judgment. This will slow the boat’s speed but keep maneuverability. Lines and fenders should be prepared and ready to use, just as they would be for a landing under power.

The skipper must have an idea of how far the boat will coast after the last sail is lowered or allowed to luff and before the boat loses maneuverability. This can be learned in open water by heading the boat up into the wind and allowing the sails to luff, observing how far she carries her way. A lightweight centerboard boat will stop in the water almost immediately, while a heavy keelboat may travel for several boat lengths before stopping, depending on wind and sea conditions; see Figure 8-24.

Figure 8-24 As the boat approaches the wharf, the helmsman steers off the wind, and the main and jib sheets are eased way out. The helmsman then steers across the wind with sails luffing and uses the boat’s remaining momentum to round up into the wind at the desired berth. The distance that the boat will coast under such conditions must be gauged by experience; additional braking force, if needed, can be supplied by backing the main against the wind. The jib is often doused at the beginning of this maneuver to clear the foredeck for handling dock lines and to prevent the jib from backwinding and forcing the bow away from the dock.

When the boat is judged to be the right distance from the dock, she is brought into the wind with the sheets freed, sails luffing. The boat coasts in, still with maneuverability. The right distance will vary with each boat and in each set of wind and sea conditions.

Ideally, the boat should lose way and come to a stop of her own accord within arm’s reach of the pier, then lines can be neatly placed ashore and the boat secured.

Don’t Be Embarrassed to Try Again If the landing looks bad, the skipper should not hesitate to use the last of his maneuverability to turn away from the pier. This allows the boat to get away and make a fresh approach.

### Anchoring Under Sail

When anchoring a sailboat, the skipper must, of course, remember that most sailboats require more water than most powerboats, and he must be mindful of his draft when selecting an anchorage. Furthermore, it is important to remember that because of their keels and their lofty rigging, sailboats are affected differently by wind and current than are powerboats. When anchored too close together, a sailboat and a powerboat will swing differently, and may collide. For this reason, and because of their greater draft, sailboats tend to anchor together in deeper water (see Chapter 9, this page).

The procedures for setting and retrieving an anchor from a boat with only sail power are generally similar to those for setting and retrieving an anchor under engine power. However, it can be difficult to set the anchor properly without using an engine in reverse to back down on it and dig it into the bottom.

#### Setting an Anchor Under Sail

Approach the chosen anchorage under reduced sail, perhaps under mainsail alone. Experiment with your boat and find out what is best.

Follow the recommendations given in Chapter 9, Anchoring. Instead of backing down in reverse gear while paying out scope, however, it is necessary to back down under sail. (See this page for discussion of scope.)

Backing down is best done by backwinding the mainsail firmly and allowing the wind to catch it and back the boat down. If the boat spins and will not back down in a straight line, straighten it up by pushing the boom out to the other side. This can be a tricky maneuver because the boat will start to sail away and may not back down properly. It may be necessary to drop all sail, settle back to full scope, and then raise sail again, briefly, to apply pressure on the anchor to set it.

#### Raising an Anchor Under Sail

To raise the anchor without the use of power in a small boat is as simple as pulling up the anchor line, then pulling up the anchor hand over hand. The sail should be already up and luffing, or ready to raise as soon as the anchor is up; see Figure 8-25.

Figure 8-25 This anchor is being raised while the mainsail is already raised and allowed to luff. When the anchor has been secured in place, the boat will drift backward in irons, and must be skillfully handled to get off on the proper tack. Take care not to drift back onto other boats while getting underway.

In larger craft that might be too heavy to pull upwind while bringing in the anchor line, other measures will be necessary. The anchor line can be brought in on a windlass, or the boat can be sailed in short tacks up to the anchor, with the crew bringing in the rode by hand as the boat travels over it until the anchor is at short scope. Then the crew must cleat the anchor line promptly, and the momentum of the boat will break out the anchor. It can then be raised by hand.

### Using a Mooring Under Sail

The use of a mooring by a sailboat without mechanical power is much like the process of anchoring. The primary difference is that when picking up a mooring, the point of action is more precisely defined; boat handling in the final moments must be much more carefully done.

#### Departing a Mooring

Leaving a mooring under sail is just as simple as leaving under power, perhaps simpler because there is less worry of fouling the mooring in the propeller. The mainsail may be hoisted before casting off the mooring pennant, but the jib is often hoisted later, to keep the foredeck clear for the person throwing off the pennant.

Getting Off on the Right Tack By waiting for the natural swing of the boat, by backwinding a sail as discussed on the previous page, or by holding the pennant far out to one side (and perhaps moving aft a bit while holding the pennant out), the person releasing the mooring can send the bow of the boat off in a chosen direction, to port or to starboard, allowing the mainsail to fill on one side and the boat to pick up speed.

Caution must be taken that the pennant is not released when the boat is exactly head to wind, because it is then “in irons” and may drift backward “in irons” without steerageway. It may continue to drift without any wind in the mainsail until she fetches up on a boat moored astern or in the shallows near shore.

#### Picking Up a Mooring Under Sail

When picking up a mooring under sail, the skipper’s knowledge of the particular boat is called upon. Again, wind, current, and sea conditions must be considered, and practice will pay off.

As the boat nears the mooring, station a crewman forward to pick up the pennant, or be prepared to go forward quickly yourself if you are alone. Turn the boat directly into the wind, and let the sails luff while the boat is still a few boat lengths away from the mooring buoy. It should have sufficient momentum to keep going ahead and stop with her bow just at the pennant, but this takes practice; see Figure 8-26. Just how many boat lengths to allow is part of the skill involved, and the distance will change from day to day, depending on the wind and current, and from boat to boat.

Figure 8-26 To pick up a mooring under sail, a slow approach is made with a crewmember stationed forward. The boat must not approach too fast, but must have enough speed to maintain steerage. When the mooring pennant has been picked up and secured, the sails should be dropped promptly. Practice is required, and a good sailor makes it look much easier than it is.

As with coming into a pier for a landing, if the maneuver isn’t working right—just head the boat around, trim the sails, and try again.

## SAIL HANDLING & STOWAGE

Sails are expensive—ask any sailboat skipper/owner! The proper handling and stowage of sails will do much to extend their life and reduce overall costs. Some variations may be necessary on different craft, but the general procedures that follow will cover most situations.

### Headsails

Roller furling for headsails is one of many innovations that promote simplified, convenient handling of sails; not surprisingly the system has been growing steadily in popularity. The furling mechanism typically consists of a headfoil that is fitted over the forestay. The headsail halyard is attached to a swivel that can slide up and down the foil as well as swivel around on it. A furling line is wound around a reel-like drum fixed to the base of the foil, with the line led back to the cockpit to a point convenient to the crew. Some models feature a continuous line around the reel that is led aft on blocks; see Figure 8-27.

Figure 8-27 A typical sailboat roller furling system for a headsail uses a reel-like drum to contain the furling line. The furling line can be controlled from the helm position.

To raise the sail, the head is attached to the swivel and the boltrope fed into the groove of the foil. The tack is attached to the drum. The halyard on the swivel pulls up both the swivel and sail. When the furling line is hauled aft, the drum and foil turn around the forestay, rolling the sail around it as well. The furling line is cleated to store the sail furled on the forestay. To protect the sail from ultraviolet deterioration, a sacrificial protective strip is often sewn along the leech and foot. To set the sail, the furling line is released. Tension on a sheet unrolls the headsail, assisted by the wind once the aft part of the sail begins to fill.

A roller-furled headsail can be reefed by furling it partway, thus enabling two or three headsails of different sizes to be replaced by one roller-furling one. To maintain proper angle of the sheets when the sail is reefed, jib fairleads must be moved forward on their tracks.

### Mainsails

Roller furling systems exist in a number of variations for mainsails as well. Some feature an in-mast or behind-the-mast furler that begins by winding the luff of the sail, pulling the clew forward. The disadvantage of such systems is that they preclude the use of battens, often require a loose-footed main, and add weight aloft.

In-boom furling systems that furl the foot of the sail on an internal roller are actually a refinement of older roller reefing systems that worked by wrapping the sail around the boom itself. In practice, the boom is usually supported by the topping lift or a solid vang while the halyard is released and a handle winds the roller in the boom. The customary difficulty of getting a proper sail set, which used to affect older systems, has been eliminated on many modern versions.

A more commonly employed (and distinctly less expensive) means of reefing is a jiffy, or slab, system that makes use of cringles at two or three reef points on the luff and leech. Reefing lines are fastened to the boom, led up through the cringles on the leech and down to a sheave at the boom end, and then forward to the gooseneck. To reef, the boat is taken head to wind, and the topping lift is tensioned in order to take the weight of the boom. The halyard and outhaul are then eased off, and the reef cringle at the luff is hooked onto a tack hook. As the halyard is tensioned, the appropriate reefline is taken up to pull the new clew down and aft, and the topping lift is eased. The new foot of the sail is then secured, either by means of permanent lines on the sail or with sail ties led through cringles spaced between the leech and luff reefing points.

As unwieldy as all this sounds, with a certain amount of planning, a reef using a jiffy reefing system can usually be taken in or let out in less than a minute, and the resulting shortened sail can be set well.

### Spinnakers

The lack of luff support makes spinnakers more unstable and more difficult to launch, jibe, and douse (take down). Some new designs are equipped with a reinforced patch and a cringle in the center to which a “retriever,” or “take down,” line is attached to assist in dousing the sail, and sometimes for pulling the sail through a tubular launcher incorporated into the hull with a funnel-like outlet on deck. The retriever is then led through the tube to the cockpit. The doused sail, which is now stored in the tube, is ready to be redeployed whenever it is needed.

Another technique for hoisting the spinnaker entails careful packing beforehand. The sail is pulled through a funnel-like device equipped with elastic bands stored on its narrow end. As the head of the sail is pulled out the narrow end, bands are placed around it at intervals. The spinnaker is rigged and hoisted with the bands in place. When the sheet and guy are trimmed, the bands break and let the sail fills.

A tubular sleeve with rings at each end (variously called a sock, sally, or chute scoop, etc.) may also be used. The spinnaker is stored inside the sleeve and attached to it. The sleeve is hoisted on the spinnaker halyard.

A line running the length of the sleeve is threaded through a block at the halyard end, and from there is attached to the ring at the bottom. The sock is hoisted fully with the sail inside, and then the line is pulled in such a way that it will slip the sleeve upward. Wind filling the bottom of the sail usually helps to move the bottom ring and sock toward the halyard until the spinnaker billows and fills. The sleeve, meanwhile, remains at the head of the spinnaker while it is flying, and the line from the sleeve is cleated on deck. To douse the spinnaker, the sheet and guy are eased and the line attached to the sock’s bottom ring is hauled in so as to pull the sock down over the sail. In addition to being useful in dousing, a sock also can be used to control the sail while jibing whenever the boater is sailing short-handed. The sock is merely pulled down over the sail, set up on the opposite tack, and pulled again to set the sail.

Figure 8-28 To store a lowered mainsail, pull the sail aft from the leech, flaking it on opposite sides of the boom as you go.

### Storing Sails

Headsails not stored on a roller system should be dry and flaked—folded accordion-style—before being bagged. Though not always the easiest thing to do in rough weather, the crew can control a hanked-on sail as it comes down on the side deck by moving forward and pulling aft on the leech, securing the sail to the rail as they go. Ideally, another crewmember, sitting back-to-bow in the bow pulpit, can control the luff to assist with flaking. If the flaked sail is to be bagged, the sheets are untied, and it is rolled neatly from the clew forward, ready to fit in the bag opening.

Hanks can be left on the headstay until the sail is stored. Sails that fit into a headfoil present a difficulty, since they are controlled only by the halyard and tack when dropped. Care must always be taken to ensure that the sail does not fill on deck and then blow overboard.

An elongated bag—aptly referred to as a sausage bag—is often used in place of a conventional sail bag whenever using headsails constructed from new sail materials, such as Mylar or Kevlar, which can be damaged if they are folded too tightly. The zipper on the bag is opened lengthwise and clipped to the lifelines before the sail is dropped to the deck. Then, once the sail is dropped and flaked in the open bag, the full-length zipper is closed to enclose the sail.

A number of systems exist to help control the mainsail. lazy jacks—ropes or wires running from mid-mast to the boom—keep the sail on the boom when it is dropped; see Figure 8-29. Another system, called a Dutchman, features vertical lines running from the topping lift (or a similar line), through cringles on the sail and down to the boom. When the halyard is released, the vertical lines hold the sail in line with the boom.

Figure 8-29 Lazy jacks, shown here, are designed to help control the mainsail as it is dropped by cradling it on the boom.

To store the lowered mainsail on the boom, begin at the leech and pull the sail aft, flaking it on alternating sides of the boom; see Figure 8-28. Ties can be used at intervals to lash the sail to the boom. As soon as possible, the sail should be covered to prevent ultraviolet deterioration. Lazy jacks or a Dutchman may require a special sail cover.

## NEW SAILBOAT TYPES

Sailing is undergoing another major step in its evolution. Techniques explored by sailboarders, multihull sailors, and racing dinghy sailors have found their way into the mainstream of sailing. In addition, techniques rooted in pure science and aircraft speed engineering—such as rigid wings and hydrofoils—are finding practical, if not widespread, application.

Several factors are making sailing a faster and more exciting sport. One is the simple fact that most North Americans enjoy speed. Yet the cost of moving across the water at speed is very high. Many recreational boaters just can’t afford to run a fast powerboat. For them, the thrill of a catamaran or sailboard at high speed, not to mention the challenge of handling it, is an affordable choice.

Another factor is the availability of strong and light materials. In fact, many of the designs we consider recent and new have been around in slightly different forms for most of the last 100 years or so. For example, extremely light, flat-hulled racers with lots of sail area and asymmetrical spinnakers are very like the “sandbaggers” that were raced in New York Harbor late in the nineteenth century.

What’s different now is that light, highly stressed designs can be built of strong materials, making ownership by mainstream sailors possible. Sandbagger sailing, on the other hand, was semi-professional and certainly not for the family man—just as America’s Cup sailing today is very distant from family-oriented racing.

### Multihulls

The most obvious “new” sailboat type is the catamaran or trimaran. In fact, the idea is ancient and was tried out as a racing design also in the nine-teeth century.

Multihulls first gained acceptance in the 1960s as light and fast recreational boats, but began to be seen as a practical (and even potentially safer) solution to long-distance cruising. Their high construction cost (at least in a production setting) and the general conservatism of the North American market kept them in the background through the 1960s and ’70s. However, in the ’80s, European and some exceptional North American sailors successfully sailed multihulls in the open transoceanic competition offered by such races as the Single-Handed Transatlantic Race.

There are now many successful builders of production multihulls in Europe and North America, and their superiority for delivering flat-out speed has been well demonstrated in various professional-level ocean races as well as Dennis Conner’s famous defense of the America’s Cup in 1988. Multihulls also hold many of the world’s offshore speed records, including the round-the-world speed record, which was lowered to just over 45 days by the maxi trimaran Banque Populaire V in 2012, then lowered again in 2017 to just under 41 days by the maxi trimaran IDEC 3.

Along with the huge stability provided by two or three separate hulls, multihull designers have introduced such innovations as the rotating mast and the full-batten sail. By allowing the mast to rotate on a vertical peg at the step, catamaran sailors are able to point the mast into the airflow and to induce the least amount of drag. By “over-rotating,” they can more precisely control the shape of the full-batten sail. A rotating mast can also be built with a lighter and stronger section, because its wider surface can be regarded as sail area rather than parasitic drag.

### Rigid-Wing Sails

The wide rotating mast and very stiff, full-batten sails of catamaran competition eventually led to the rigid-wing sail. Arguably the most famous wing of all—and certainly the largest—was the 220-foot wing on the 113-foot trimaran USA 17, which won the 2010 America’s Cup. Wing sails have since become an integral part of Cup competition. Wings have also long been integral to C Class catamaran racing and are making inroads in other cutting-edge classes, such as the Moth 11-foot dinghy class.

Although rigid-wing sails still belong almost exclusively to the realm of extreme catamaran competition, a number of forward-thinking designers are developing wing designs appropriate for more general use. A company called Harbor Wing Technologies, for example, has teamed up with the West Coast design firm of Morrelli & Melvin to create a wing that rotates 360 degrees and includes “tails” that control the amount of lift generated. A single sailor can control the wing using a joystick and sail-by-wire computer technology. Possible applications include those aboard everything from cruising boats to unmanned defense and marine research vessels.

Figure 8-30 By canting its keel dramatically to windward, the VOR 70 Groupama creates additional righting moment, which allows it to carry a far greater press of sail than would otherwise be possible.

### Planing Hulls

Sailboats have been planing since the early 1900s, but it is only in the last 30 years that light, high-powered sailboats have become extremely popular. Boats with wide, light hulls are common, and many of these are equipped with trapezes that allow their crew (sometimes both skipper and forward hand) to suspend themselves horizontally over the surface of the water on the windward side.

The enormous increase in stability that trapezing allows is exploited by very large sail areas in relation to the weight of the boat and crew. Planing a boat of this type is possible even in gentle winds of only 12 or 13 knots.

Trapezing is only practical on boats no longer than about 20 feet (6.1 m). At this size, the complexity of crew work and the number of trapeze artists required takes such boats out of the realm of recreation and into the realm of pure sport.

However, even without trapezes, there are many light, but ballasted, keelboats that are capable of planing in heavy winds. While such planing episodes can be brief (and are often assisted by a following sea that induces surfing), these light, flat-keel boats nevertheless achieve speeds well beyond the normal limit of the speed of a wave length equal to their displacement waterline.

### Keels & Ballast

One of the refinements that has made it possible for a ballasted boat to sail beyond displacement hull speed is the use of very deep, and consequently narrower, fin keels.

A given volume of lead ballast, if stretched downward, acts on the hull with a longer lever arm and can, therefore, provide more righting moment for the same weight. There are practical limits to the extent of draft, however, that have to do with the mechanical stresses placed on a lifting surface like a fin keel, especially when it is swung violently by wave action at the surface (not to mention shallow water).

To further increase the righting moment for a given keel depth, or “span,” many grand-prix racers now employ swing keels with heavy lead bulbs on their tips. Pivoting the bulb to windward dramatically increases the lateral distance between a boat’s center of gravity and center of buoyancy, increasing the amount of sail it can carry. Some boats can even rotate their keels entirely up and out of the water, in which case daggerboards are used to keep the boat from drifting to leeward. The downsides to these kinds of systems are their expense, complexity, and vulnerability to breakage. In a number of cases, racing boats have had to withdraw from competition because the hydraulic rams controlling their keels have failed.

The quest for greater righting moment without the penalty of weight has also found expression in the use of movable and expendable water ballast. There are two common approaches. In the most obvious method, water is taken on board and held in tanks at the extreme beam of the hull. If the boat is working to windward on starboard tack, for example, its water ballast is pumped into the starboard tank, where its weight provides the best righting moment. As or before the boat tacks, water is transferred by pump or gravity to the port tank, ready for the new tack. Of course, great care must be taken that the boat is not completely disabled should the ballast end up on the wrong side in heavy winds. The amount of water ballast carried relative to the boat’s fixed stability has to be carefully calculated by the designer. Obviously, racing boats, especially single-handed ocean racers with the most to gain, take greater calculated risks.

Another type of water ballast has nothing to do with racing or risk-taking. Several small, trailerable cruising sailboats have a different kind of water ballast, which allows them to be light enough to tow behind a car but heavy enough to achieve good stability. A long, internal water tank is built into the hull at the lowest part of the bilge. A hole allows water to flow freely into and out of the tank. When the dry boat is launched, the tank fills up, adding a couple of hundred pounds at the lowest and therefore most advantageous part of the hull.

When it’s time to go home, the (heavy) boat is pulled onto the trailer and, as it begins to rise above its load waterline, the ballast tanks begin to empty. By the time the boat is at the top of the ramp, it’s losing weight rapidly.

Figure 8-31 Oracle Team USA 17, an America’s Cup 50 (AC50) catamaran, is shown here practicing in Bermuda Sound prior to the 2017 competition for the Cup. Class specifications limit AC50 boats to no more than 49 feet, 3 inches long, 27 feet, 9 inches wide, and 5,362 pounds in weight. The semi-rigid wing main is hinged in the middle to control camber. An AC50’s hulls can ride clear of the water on its rudder and daggerboard foils, reducing drag and making speeds of 50-plus knots possible.

### Sailboards, Kiteboards, and Hydrofoils

Currently, the fastest sailboat in the world is hardly a boat at all—it is a kiteboard. An offshoot of the sailboards that came to prominence in the 1970s, a kiteboard is a very sophisticated device with a lightweight planing hull and a large “sail” that flies high above the water, where the winds are stronger than at sea level.

Another technology at the cutting edge of sailboat design is hydroplanes. At the smaller end of the scale are “foiling” Moths, the latest incarnation of the developmental Moth dinghy class. The key to winning in these hyper-competitive boats is keeping the entire hull clear of the water so that it is supported by a pair of hydrofoils, one at the bottom of the rudder and another at the bottom of the keel—even during tacks and jibes. These diminutive vessels regularly reach speeds in the high 20s.

The radical foiled trimaran Sailrocket 2 set sailing speed records over distances of 500 meters (65.45 knots) and one nautical mile (55.32 knots) in 2012. In 2017, Frenchman Alexandre Caizergues set a 500-meter record for kitesurfers of 57.97 knots while sailing in more than 50 knots of wind.

# CHAPTER9

ANCHORING

Types of Anchors • Anchor Lines • Anchoring Techniques • Special Anchoring Situations • Permanent Moorings

Of all the skills involved in seaman ship, the art of anchoring is one the boater must master if he is to cruise with an easy mind. Perhaps you have been getting by with inadequate gear and bad practices acquired in home waters. Sooner or later, carelessness and lack of technical know-how will lead to difficulty—probably inconvenience, possibly danger.

The essence of successful anchoring is to “stay put,” without dragging, whenever the anchor is set. And don’t forget the need to respect the rights of nearby boats that could be fouled or damaged if your anchor drags.

Though anchoring skill may not be learned from printed pages alone, this chapter should help the beginning skipper to get off to a good start and the seasoned boater to verify or update his technique.

In quiet anchorages and familiar surroundings, ground tackle (the gear used) and the methods employed are seldom put to a test. But strange waters, inadequate shelter in an exposed anchorage during a hard blow, and unexpected variations in wind and current will surely take the measure of both tackle and technique.

Successful anchoring requires having the right gear on board and knowing how to use it.

## GROUND TACKLE

Anchors have evolved over centuries from a simple stone fastened to a crude rope to modern designs that have been carefully engineered to achieve the greatest holding power with the least weight. It did not take long for mariners to realize that what was needed was an anchor that would dig in and hook the bottom, rather than merely a weight that might drag across it. Simple wooden hooks were first added, later changing to iron. Still later a stock was installed perpendicular to the plane of the hooks so as to put them in a better position to get a bite of the bottom. Holding power in softer bottoms was improved by adding broad flukes to the hooks. Now, anchors have highly engineered designs that enable them to quickly and deeply bury themselves in the bottom, thus achieving the maximum holding power for the least weight.

#### Some Terms & Definitions

To prevent confusion in the use of terms, refer to the labeled illustration of the parts of an anchor, Figure 9-01, and the definitions in the sidebar on this page (also refer to Appendix F for further definitions). A popular version of the classic anchor was chosen to illustrate the parts. Subsequently we shall see how the proportioning and placement of parts have varied with the introduction of later designs.

Figure 9-01 Anchor parts are identified here on a traditional kedge anchor, but many of the terms are the same for most modern types. The kedge (described on this page) is perhaps better known as a Fisherman or Yachtsman anchor, these being two familiar kedge designs.

The anchoring system is all the gear used in conjunction with the anchor, including the line, chain, shackles, and swivels. The anchor line, including any chain, is often called the rode.

### Types of Anchors

Scan a marine hardware catalog and, without experience, you may be confused by the diversity of anchor designs. What you should be buying, essentially, is holding power; sheer weight is no index of that. On the contrary, scientific design is the key to efficiency, and a modern patented anchor, if properly manufactured, stands at the top of the list on a holding-power-to-weight basis.

#### Lightweight-type Anchors

The lightweight-type of burying anchor introduced just prior to World War II was developed by R.S. Danforth. Its efficiency in service was so high that it permitted the retraction of deliberately grounded amphibious vessels during assaults on enemy-held beachheads. After that war, models were developed specifically for small craft, and these are now widely used. The term “Danforth,” although the trade name belonging to one manufacturer, is often used generically for all anchors of this general design.

Although refinements by a number of subsequent manufacturers have led to minor changes, the Danforth design remains generally the same as the original. The lightweight anchor’s high holding-power-to-weight ratio (the ultimate measure of an anchor’s desirability) makes it a standard piece of equipment on many recreational vessels.

In this type of anchor, pivoting flukes are long and sharp so that heavy strains bury the anchor completely; see Figure 9-02. It tends to work down through soft bottoms to firmer holding ground beneath, often burying part of the line as well; see Figure 9-03. On some designs, the angle between the flukes and stock can be varied for improved performance on soft or hard bottoms. In place of a stock through the head, the lightweight type has a round rod at the crown end to prevent the anchor from rolling. This placement of the stock does not interfere with the shank being drawn into the hawsepipes of larger craft for stowage. (Many skippers place protective rubber tips over the stock ends to prevent scarring the boat’s topsides and the bringing up of mud and sand from the bottom if the stock is a hollow rod.)

Figure 9-02 Lightweight-type anchors are the most widely used type. The lowered anchor will initially come to rest on one of the crown plates (red arrow), positioning the fluke tips to dig into the sediment when the rode comes under strain.

Figure 9-03 A lightweight-type anchor lands with its flukes flat against the bottom (A). A strain on the anchor line causes the flukes to penetrate the bottom (B). Further strain on the rode causes the flukes, and sometimes the entire anchor and part of the rode, to be buried (C).

In use, a lightweight-type anchor at first rests flat on the bottom. A forward pull with a slight upward angle on the shank turns its broad, pivoted flukes downward so that their sharp points dig into the bottom. The stock at the crown prevents the anchor from rolling and disengaging one or both flukes. A key element in the high performance of lightweight-type anchors is the design of the crown. The two flat plates position the thin, sharp flukes to dig into the bottom and penetrate deeply. The surfaces of the crown are well separated from the flukes to help reduce clogging with mud, grass, or bottom debris that might otherwise interfere with the penetration of the anchor and its holding power.

After the initial strain placed on the line, and thus on the shank, has buried the flukes into the bottom, subsequent pull on the line continues to bury the anchor until the force of the pull and the resistance of the anchor’s broad flukes are balanced against each other; refer to Figure 9-03.

Compared to other anchors, this popular type is easy to handle and stow. Its holding power is most effective in favorable bottoms such as sand, mud, or clay; on a rocky bottom, the flukes may or may not catch. Where there are weeds or grass, this type of anchor will often skip across the bottom without digging in; if it does set, it may be in grass or weeds that will then pull out with a complete loss of holding power.

A number of manufacturers produce anchors of the lightweight, burying type. In selecting an anchor, remember that all manufacturers have their own design variations, and “look-alikes” do not necessarily hold similarly. Be sure to check both design and construction integrity. Variations in the fluke-to-shank angle from one anchor of a given size and model to the next may indicate that the manufacturer has failed to exercise adequate quality control. Pay special attention to hinges or pivot pins. Carefully inspect all welds—if the anchor breaks in use, its holding-power-to-weight ratio becomes meaningless.

Lightweight-type anchors are also made of aluminum under the trade names of Fortress and Guardian. As a result of careful engineering, these anchors have shown even greater holding power than steel anchors of comparable size, plus increased ease of handling from their significantly lighter weight. These anchors can be disassembled and stowed as a flat package. Another desirable feature of Fortress anchors is their ability to be assembled in either of two ways for different fluke angles in order to maximize holding power in normal or soft mud bottoms; see Figure 9-04. One drawback is that these anchors have a tendency to plane or fly off in the water as they are lowered.

Figure 9-04 The Fortress anchor, made of aluminum alloy, has high holding power per pound of weight. It does best in softer bottoms and performs poorly in grass and weeds. The shank angle can be adjusted to the type of bottom.

##### ANCHORING TERMINOLOGY

• Anchor Device designed to engage the sea bed, lake bed, or river bed, and through its resistance to movement, to maintain a vessel within a given radius.

• Vertical load The downward force placed on the bow of the vessel by its anchor rode.

#### Plow Anchors

The plow anchor is quite different from the lightweight type. It was invented in England by Professor G.I. Taylor of Cambridge University; he called it the CQR (which stands for coastal, quick release). Its most distinctive feature is a shank that pivots longitudinally on a hinge; this reduces its tendency to break out from the bottom when the boat swings and the direction of pull changes; see Figure 9-05. Similar models have since been developed and manufactured in the United States and other countries. It has found wide acceptance because of its demonstrated efficiency in a variety of bottoms. Opinions vary as to its effectiveness in heavy grass or weed, which is not surprising in that many weed growths resist penetration by any anchor.

Figure 9-05 The plow anchor gets its name from the shape of its single deep-burying fluke pivoted at the end of the shank.

When a plow anchor is lowered, it first lies on its side on the bottom; see Figure 9-06. Then when a pull is put on the line, it rights itself after moving a short distance, driving the point of the plow into the bottom and finally burying the anchor completely if the bottom is soft. Suggested weights for CQR anchors may vary from 15 pounds (6.8 kg) for a 25-foot (7.6 m) boat to 60 pounds (27.2 kg) for a 60-foot (18.3 m) craft, with heavier sizes available for larger vessels. For best performance, the manufacturer recommends a minimum of 18 feet (5.5 m) of chain between the anchor and a fiber line.

Figure 9-06 A plow or similar burying anchor normally lands on the bottom on its side (A). A strain on the anchor rode causes it to turn more upright and quickly bite into the bottom (B). Further strain on the line results in the anchor burying itself in the bottom (C).

Because of the pivoting feature of its shank, the plow anchor tends to remain buried over moderate changes in direction of pull on the line caused by wind or current shifts. There is no projecting fluke to foul the anchor line, and the plow breaks out easily when the pull is vertical for raising the anchor. Plow anchors do not stow well on deck and are usually hoisted to a bow roller fitting, where they are secured.

As with lightweight types, plow anchors are produced by a number of manufacturers, and their effectiveness may vary. Forged models are stronger than cast versions. A variation of the plow, the Delta anchor, has a solid, nonpivoting shank, but otherwise the same basic design; see Figure 9-07. It is weighted so that the pointed fluke is ready to dig in as soon as it reaches the bottom. This anchor design is also somewhat easier to stow on a bow roller, as it does not have the bulky hinge.

Figure 9-07 The Delta anchor is similar to the CQR plow, except that it is one piece, eliminating the swivel joint between the shank and fluke. Its holding power is said to be slightly superior to other plow types.

#### The Simpson Lawrence Horizon Claw Anchor

Another anchor from the United Kingdom is the Horizon Claw. The anchor is similar to the Bruce anchor, originally developed for use with offshore oil- and gas-well drilling rigs; see Figure 9-08. The Simpson is a single piece of high-grade steel casting and is available in sizes ranging from 2 to 66 pounds.

Figure 9-08 The Bruce anchor is shaped so that once it has been set, should it pull out from a wide change in direction of pull, it will reset almost immediately. Intentional breakout, however, is easy on a vertical pull. The anchor is said to work well in sand and mud, and is strong enough to be used in rocks.

A burying-type anchor, the Simpson is designed to right itself no matter how it lands on the bottom while digging in within two shank lengths; it breaks out easily with a vertical pull. The design is particularly focused on quick resetting should the anchor disengage from the bottom after a change in direction of pull. The anchor is available in mirror-polished, precision-cast 316 stainless steel.

The SuperMax is a similar design that has a larger fluke area; see Figure 9-09. Recommended sizes for these anchors are roughly the same as for plow anchors.

Figure 9-09 The SuperMax anchor’s greater holding power seems to come from the extra-large fluke. The adjustability of the shank allows the angle to be set for use in varying types of bottoms.

#### Kedge Anchors

In discussing kedge anchors it is important to distinguish between the more massive, ancient types and the later versions designed for small boats. In glossaries, “kedge anchors” are often defined as light anchors (of any design) carried out from a vessel aground to free her by winching in on the rode. Here, however, we refer to the kedge as an anchor with the more traditional type of arms, flukes, and stock, as distinguished from newer, lighter types.

Kedge anchors are not widely used on modern recreational boats, but they do have their place in special applications. Some models have relatively sharp bills and small flukes to bite better into hard sand bottoms; see Figure 9-01. Others have broader flukes on heavier arms for greater holding power in softer bottoms and greater strength when hooking into rocks or coral heads. A kedge anchor is normally an excellent choice for bottoms with heavy growths of grass or weeds—one arm will penetrate the vegetation and dig into the bottom beneath. Typical designs are the Herreshoff, Fisherman, and Yachtsman, all varying in small details.

Kedge anchors are not of the “burying” type, as the shank lies on the bottom and one arm remains exposed. On the other hand, a kedge’s “hook” design recommends it, probably above all other types, on rocky bottoms where one fluke can find a crevice. Retrieval, with proper precautions, is not too difficult. (More about this later; see this page.) Modern kedge designs have a diamond-shaped fluke to lessen the risk of the anchor line fouling the exposed arm, but this possibility must be considered if a change in direction of pull of a half-circle or more occurs.

Stock & Stockless Types The plow and Bruce anchors are of the stockless type. Others are classified as being of the stock type, although the stock, as we have seen, may be at either the ring or crown end. Those with the stock at the crown end, such as the lightweight type, have a fixed stock. On nearly all designs where the stock is at the ring end, such as the various kedge anchors, the stock is loose and can be folded for better stowage. Frequently, a key is required to pin the stock of a kedge in its open position when set up ready for use; the key is lashed in its slot to hold it in place.

#### Anchors of Special Design

The northill is an anchor with a unique design. At its crown end, two arms with sharpened flukes extend at right angles to the shank and two arms without flukes act as a stock. In some versions, all four arms can be folded flat against the shank for stowage.

Several manufacturers around the world sell anchors with proprietary designs and unique names. Among these new anchor patterns are the Barnacle, Bullwagga, Hans C-Anchor, Spade, Vetus, Rocna, and Manson Supreme. Some of these may disappear from the market, and new ones, promising technological breakthroughs, undoubtedly will be developed. Some, particularly the Rocna and the Manson Supreme (see Figure 9-10), have performed well in independent tests. Both of these new patterns differ from more traditional anchors in their prominent roll bars, which are designed to make the anchors self-righting and thus able to set in the proper attitude in a variety of seabeds. Both anchors set quickly and hold firmly in mud, grass, and rock and coral bottoms. They also hold after a significant wind shift. Another advantage of the roll bar is that it results in a larger blade area for each anchor. These anchors and others, including the Spade and the SuperMax, are sometimes called scoop anchors due to their concave upper blade surface (which distinguishes them from plows) and their single large blade (which distinguishes them from a claw type like the Bruce). The Manson Supreme is unique in that it has twin slots in the shank so it can be set in a variety of sea bottoms; you would use the longer one for anchoring in rock and coral; the shorter one for grass and mud. The idea is that if the anchor is fouled in a rocky bed, for example, the shackle will slide and lift forward so that you don’t have to set a trip line. The Manson Supreme is approved by Lloyds Register of Shipping, a significant endorsement. Although both the Rocna and Manson Supreme offer superior performance, the roll bar can make them difficult to stow. Before buying one of these anchors, be sure it will fit on your bow roller.

Figure 9-10 The Manson Supreme anchor’s roll bar is designed to right it when capsized, ensuring that the blade is properly oriented to dig into the seabed. Holding power derives from blade area, not weight, enabling a light anchor. Stowage is inconvenient in the absence of a properly sized bow roller.

#### Other Anchor Types

Another design of anchor is frequently referred to as navy type. Inexperienced boaters, when seeing them on large ships, sometimes conclude that they are best for all vessels, including small boats—this is simply not so. Ships use them because such stockless anchors can be hauled up into hawsepipes. The ratio of holding power to weight for these anchors is so small that, if weight is held within reason for a small boat, holding power is far below safe limits.

Grapnels, though used by some commercial fishermen, are not recommended for general anchoring service aboard recreational boats. These are also stockless models with, as a rule, five curved, sharp-billed, claw-like prongs symmetrically arranged around the crown end of the shank. Eyes may be cast in both ends of the shank—at the head in lieu of a ring for attachment of a rode (if used as an anchor) and at the crown end for a buoyed trip line (see this page). By dragging a small grapnel back and forth, a boater may grapple for a piece of equipment lost on the bottom; see Figure 9-11.

Figure 9-11 This grapnel might be used to recover a mooring chain. With a trip line rigged to its crown end, it can be used to anchor a boat on a rocky bottom.

Folding anchors are those which allow all parts to fold against the shank into the smallest possible space for the most convenient stowage—at some sacrifice of holding power and strength. In one stockless type, there are two pairs of flukes at right angles to each other, almost in the manner of a grapnel. In rocky bottoms they hook readily and may be rigged to pull out easily, crown first. Such anchors are often excellent in bottoms with heavy growths of grass or weeds, as one or two arms penetrate the vegetation to get a bite into the bottom. They typically have less than desirable holding power in loose sand or soft mud due to small fluke area.

Mushroom anchors are principally used in conjunction with permanent moorings, and are discussed in more detail under that heading; see this page. Modified versions of the mushroom are sold for small craft such as canoes and rowboats, but their holding power is so slight as to be almost nonexistent.

#### Sea Anchors

All the anchors under discussion in this chapter are designed to keep a boat from drifting by engagement with the bottom; sea anchors do not fall in this category. These are intended to float at or just below the surface, serving merely as a drag to hold a boat’s bow (or stern) up toward the oncoming seas so as to prevent her from lying in the trough. Sea anchors are primarily used on seagoing sailboats, and then only in the heaviest weather offshore, where there is room to drift to leeward. See this page for a discussion of sea anchors and their use in rough weather.

### The Anchor Line

All of the gear, taken collectively, that lies between a boat and her anchor is called the rode—whether it is synthetic fiber (like nylon), chain, or a combination of the two.

#### Twisted Nylon

Nylon, in three-strand twist or double-braid form, is by far the most widely used material for anchor lines; other synthetics, such as Dacron, polypropylene, and polyethylene, have less desirable characteristics. Chain makes a good anchor rode, but its weight, while desirable for anchoring, may necessitate your having a winch or other mechanical assistance on board to hoist it. On a small boat, the weight of an adequate length of chain, stowed in the bow, may be too great for proper trim.

For anchoring, nylon’s greatest asset is its characteristic of stretching under load; it has a working elasticity of 15 to 25 percent. When a boat surges at anchor in steep seas, there is a heavy shock load on fittings and ground tackle—unless provision is made to absorb it gradually. Nylon’s elasticity does exactly that.

Some boaters unwittingly lose part or most of the advantage inherent in nylon by using too large a line. Within the limits of safe working loads, the smaller the diameter the greater the elasticity for given conditions. A practical limit is reached when small diameters, though rated high enough for breaking strength, are inconvenient to handle. Some experienced boaters use nylon as light as ⅜ inch (10 mm) in diameter on the working anchors of their 30- to 40-foot (9–12 m) craft. Nylon line—as also discussed in Chapter 23 on marlinespike seamanship—is highly resistant to rot, decay, and mildew but can be damaged by rust from iron fittings or a rusty chain. Nylon line should be stored out of direct sunlight to prevent a gradual deterioration from ultraviolet rays.

#### Braided Synthetic Line

Most nylon used for anchor lines is laid up by twisting three strands. Synthetics can, however, be laid up by braiding. For anchoring (as well as mooring or towing), a braided outer cover of nylon surrounds a braided inner synthetic core—this is commonly called “double-braided” or “braid-on-braid” line. The result is a line of exceptional stability with no inherent tendency to twist because of the nature of its lay. Consequently, it can be fed down into an anchor locker without fear of kinking.

When braided nylon is handled on deck, it is advisable to fake (or flake) it down in a figure-eight pattern, rather than the conventional clockwise coil used with twisted fibers. Because of the relatively smoother surface of braid, with more fibers to take the wear, chafing is less of a problem than it is with a twisted three-strand lay. Braided nylon retains an adequate degree of elasticity (14 percent at working loads, as against 25 percent for twisted nylon).

#### Chain

As the size of the vessel increases, so does the required diameter of nylon anchor line. For yachts 65 feet (20 m) or more, nylon would run to diameters up to ¾ inch or larger. This is getting to a size that is difficult to handle; the alternative is chain.

It should not be inferred from this that chain is unsuitable for use on smaller craft. Boats that cruise extensively and have occasion to anchor on sharp rock or coral often have chain; in some cases it is regarded as indispensable—it stands chafing where fiber won’t.

In larger diameters, the weight of chain makes a sag in the rode (called a catenary) that cushions shock loads due to surging from wave action on the boat. Once the slack has been taken up, however, the shock on both boat and anchor is very much greater than with nylon. You must thus be sure to use adequate scope with chain, as discussed below. Shock loads can be further mitigated by using a snubber—a short length of nylon line. After the anchor is set, one end of several feet of nylon line is hooked into a link in the chain between the boat’s deck and the water surface; the other end is made fast on deck. Then the tension on the chain is slacked off so that the load is carried by this short length of stretchable nylon line.

The three kinds of chain most used as anchor rode are “BBB,” “Proof Coil,” and “High Test.” Chain is designated by the diameter of material in the link, but the various types have links differing slightly in length. It is necessary to match the chain to the pockets of the wildcat (a pulley designed for use with chain, also called a gypsy) of the anchor windlass; see Figure 9-15. The differences in link length are slight, but they are enough to cause trouble if there is a mismatch. (Most windlasses have a capstan for line and a gypsy for chain, but special models are available where the gypsy can handle both.)

Any type of chain may be used for anchoring—BBB is slightly stronger than Proof Coil; High Test is significantly stronger than either. The selection of a chain type and size for your boat involves several factors, the first of which is adequate strength. A safe standard to use is a working load—figured from the size of the boat and the conditions to be encountered—at 20 percent of the chain’s breaking strength when new. But you must also consider weight. The chain must be heavy enough to provide a proper sag to cushion shock loads, but the length required for normal anchoring depths must not be so heavy, when stored on board, that it affects the boat’s handling characteristics or even its safety. The weight factor may dictate a combination of chain and line. Refer to Table 9-1.

Table 9-1 The sizes above are suggested for use under moderate conditions of wind and waves, with good holding ground and a scope of 5:1. For less favorable conditions, increase anchor size by one bracket and increase scope. For a “lunch hook” under good conditions with a person remaining on board, one bracket smaller can be used.

#### Nylon & Chain

In current practice, the consensus appears to be that for most craft in average conditions, the ideal rode is a combination of nylon line with a short length of chain between the line and the anchor. The chain length should be at least ½ foot per foot of boat length; longer is desirable.

One effect of chain in this combination rode is to lower the angle of pull, because chain tends to lie on the bottom. Of equal or perhaps greater significance is that modern lightweight anchors often bury completely, taking part of the rode with them. Chain tolerates the chafe, and sand has less chance to penetrate strands of the fiber line higher up. Sand doesn’t stick to chain, and mud is easily washed off. Without chain, nylon gets very dirty in mud.

Chain used in this manner varies from ¼ inch (6 mm) in diameter for 20-foot (6 m) boats up to 7/16 inch (11 mm) for 50-foot (16 m) craft; see also Table 9-1. It should be galvanized to protect against rust. Neoprene-coated chain is an added refinement, as it will not mar the boat, but such coating has a limited life in active use; corrosion may occur under the coating.

### Securing the Rode

The complete anchor system consists of the anchor and the rode, usually made up of a length of line plus a length of chain. Each element of the system must be connected to its neighbor in a strong and dependable manner.

#### Eye Splice, Thimble & Shackle

There are various methods for securing the rode to the anchor ring. With fiber line, the preferred practice is to work an eye splice around a thimble and use a shackle to join the thimble and ring; see Figure 9-12. With nylon line you can use a plastic thimble, one of galvanized metal, or one of stainless steel; be sure to keep the thimble in the eye of the line. A tight, snug splice will help, and seizings around the line and the legs of the thimble, near the V, will keep the thimble in the eye splice when the line comes under loads that stretch the eye; see this page. Some plastic thimbles have the throat partially filled in so as to keep the shackle in place; see Figure 9-13.

Figure 9-12 A shackle and an eye splice with thimble (arrow) are commonly used to secure the anchor line to the anchor ring, or better, to a short length of chain between the line and the anchor. The shackle in this photo has not yet been inserted through the thimbled eye splice.

Figure 9-13 Some plastic thimbles may have a web partially closing the throat near the pointed end. This is helpful in keeping the pin of the shackle at the far end of the thimble.

Where a shackle is used, it is a good idea to put a bit of silicone spray or waterproof grease on the threads of the shackle pin to keep it from seizing up over time; a good practice is to turn the pin all the way in tight, and then back it out a quarter- or half-turn. Be sure to safety the pin to prevent its working out accidentally; stainless steel wire can be used, but a nylon cable tie is easier to work with (use a black one, they better withstand prolonged sunlight exposure); see Figure 9-14. Watch for corrosion if different metals are used in thimbles, shackles, and rings. Cut out and resplice in a new thimble if the line becomes rust-stained.

Figure 9-14 This shackle, used to attach a short length of chain to another shackle on the anchor, is secured by running a nylon cable tie through the eye of the pin and around the side of the shackle. Stainless-steel wire can also be used for this.

A thimble and shackle provide a ready means for including, if desired, a length of chain in your rode, shackling the chain in turn to the anchor ring. Shackles should be large enough not to bind against the ring, and at least as strong as the chain itself. It is good practice to make the shackle one size larger than the chain (e.g., a 5/16-inch shackle for ¼-inch chain).

Figure 9-15 This vertical windlass has a smooth drum on top for line plus a gypsy for chain beneath it; they can be operated independently. The anchor chain passes around the gypsy and through a deck opening to the chain locker below. The smooth drum can be used with a dock line to warp the boat into a berth.

#### Anchor Bends & Bowlines

Some skippers would rather fasten their line directly to the ring using an anchor bend, seizing the free end to the rode. Others use a bowline with an extra turn around the ring, see Figure 9-16. In either case, these procedures make it easy to turn the line end-for-end occasionally, or to remove the line from the anchor for easy handling when stowing.

Figure 9-16 An anchor bowline, above, with its extra turn around the ring, is a secure way to attach the rode to the anchor, or to a mooring buoy as shown here. The loose end (arrow) can be seized to the adjacent line (see Figure 23-11).

Turning a line end-for-end greatly extends its useful life. The lower portion of the line that has carried the load for each anchoring, and the lower end that has chafed on the bottom, becomes the inboard portion seldom used with normal scope. Eye splices may be placed in both ends of the rode initially, or added as necessary when the rode is turned.

Even if the working anchor is kept made-up with line and chain, you should know how to bend a line directly to an anchor. This is often the handiest way to drop a light anchor for a brief stop or to make up a second anchor when a bridle or stern anchor is needed.

Use shackles to secure chain rode to the anchor; stout swivels are a desirable refinement. As swivels are a weak point, they must be large. On an all-chain rode they are essential. Swivels, however, should not be used with twisted soft-laid synthetic lines; a hockle (kink) may result. Double-braided synthetic lines will not hockle even when subjected to very heavy strains.

#### At the Bitter End

To guard against accidental loss of the anchor system, the inboard end of the rode—often called the bitter end—should be made fast to some part of the boat. You may do this by leading the line below, perhaps through a deck pipe, and securing it to a built-in eye or an eyebolt through a strong structural part. On sailboats you can secure it to the foot of a mast. On small boats where the entire length of rode is carried on deck, you can have an eye splice in the bitter end to attach to a securely fastened ring or eyebolt. In any case, make sure the bitter end is fastened, but always have handy some means of quickly cutting the anchor line in an emergency.

### How Many & How Heavy?

The number of anchors you should carry depends upon several things: the size of your boat, whether it is used only in sheltered waters or cruises extensively to many harbors, and, to some extent, the type of anchor.

Some small boats like runabouts and utilities have only a single anchor, but this cannot be considered adequate. Even discounting the possibility of fouling one anchor so badly that it cannot be retrieved, there are occasions when it is desirable to use two. Further, one anchor heavy enough for extreme conditions could be a nuisance in ordinary weather.

Many boats carry two anchors, with the weight of the heavier one about 1.5 times the weight of the lighter one. For cruising boats, three are undoubtedly better. This allows two to be carried on deck—a light lunch hook for brief stops while someone is aboard, and a working anchor capable of holding the boat securely overnight. The third, a storm anchor, chosen for its ability to hold securely in severe wind, current, and sea conditions, may be stowed below, accessible and ready to be attached to its rode under extreme conditions of wind and weather.

#### Anchor Size & Holding Power

Down through the years there have been repeated attempts to reduce anchor weights to a simple formula or table based on boat length or tonnage. Recommendations have varied widely, gradually becoming lighter as more modern designs replaced old-fashioned kedge anchors. With the development of patented designs, however, came the problem of minor variations between manufacturers of anchors of the same general type. Thus any table of anchor size vs. boat size, such as Table 9-1 can only be a broad recommendation, to be modified for individual craft and local situations.

### Stowage

A boater’s seamanship skills can be evaluated by the attention he gives to stowing his craft’s ground tackle. Exactly how he goes about it depends to some extent on the kind of boating he does, the size of his boat, and the way it is equipped. In any case, unless his deck is uncluttered—with gear ready for immediate use, yet secured so that it cannot shift—he will never rate high as a seaman.

Ordinarily a cruising boat will carry one, sometimes two, anchors on deck, made up and ready for use. On some small boats, where it is not feasible to leave anchors on deck at all times, or in cases where lines are stowed below at the home berth, at least one anchor and line should be prepared and made ready before getting underway from your slip or mooring. If your boat lowers its anchor from a windlass, power to that device should be on. Engines and steering systems do fail, and when they do it’s likely to be at an embarrassing moment, with wind or current setting you down on a shoal or reef. It’s too late then to think about breaking out gear that should have been ready at hand.

An anchor lying loose on deck is a potential hazard. If the boat happens to roll or pitch, it may slide across the deck, leaving scars in its wake and damaging equipment. Conceivably it could go over the side, taking the rode with it and fouling the propeller. Every anchor on deck should be stowed in chocks (available at marine stores to fit most anchors). Lashings hold the anchors in the chocks. Hardwood blocks, properly notched, can be used in lieu of metal chock fittings.

As an alternative to chocking, anchors carried aboard sailboats may be lashed to bow rails or shrouds, off the deck, where there is no risk of their getting underfoot and less risk of their fouling running rigging; see Figure 9-17. Many boats with bowsprits or pulpits have a roller at the outboard end, providing convenient and secure stowage for the working anchor; see Figure 9-18. Some larger yachts have provision for hauling the anchor into a hawsepipe fitted into the topsides forward.

Figure 9-17 Anchors are normally stowed in fitted chocks on the foredeck, but working space can be gained if they are hung from the rail as shown above.

Figure 9-18 Many boats, both power and sail, have short bowsprits that have a roller at the outer end. The anchor line passes over this roller, and the anchor can be drawn up tight against it.

#### Stowing the Storm Anchor

As the big spare storm anchor is used only on rare occasions, you can carry it in some convenient location below, or in a lazarette or stowage space below a cockpit deck, accessible through a hatch. Chocks here should be arranged to ensure that the anchor is held in place securely. If the big anchor gets adrift, it could easily cause substantial, even critical, damage. Some anchors, such as the Fortress, can be disassembled and stowed in a box or fitted bag; they can be assembled in only a few minutes with two ordinary wrenches.

While it’s desirable to stow the storm anchor in a secure, out of the way location, it must always be immediately accessible without having to move other stores. The anchor’s value will be determined not only by how well it can hold in a blow but also by how quickly it can be attached to its stored, previously prepared rode and deployed over the bow.

Lunch hooks are small and seldom needed without warning, so there’s justification for stowing them in some convenient locker. Keep them away from the compass, however, as they can be a potent cause of deviation (except, of course, for aluminum anchors).

#### Rope & Chain Lockers

Although small craft often carry their lines coiled on a forward deck or in an open cockpit, many cruising boats have a rope locker in the forepeak that can be used. Nylon dries quickly and can be fed down into lockers almost as soon as it comes aboard. Lockers must be well ventilated and arranged to assure good air circulation at all times. Dark, damp lockers are an invitation to rot and mildew. A vented hatch over the rope locker will permit exposure to a good flow of air.

The rode should always be ready to run without fouling. Line is often passed below through a deck pipe whose aft-facing slot permits it to be capped when needed to minimize the amount of water that finds its way below. Some cast mooring bitts are made with an opening on the after face through which line can be passed.

Chain won’t soak up moisture and is easy to stow in lockers. Where weight of chain in the bow of a small offshore cruising boat is objectionable, it can be overcome by splitting a long rode into two or three shorter lengths, stowed where convenient, and shackled together as necessary. An all-chain rode should be shackled to a length of nylon rope secured to a holdfast in the chain locker and long enough to be accessible on deck so that in an emergency the rope can be cut to jettison the chain and anchor.

### Scope

Once you have chosen an anchor of suitable design and size to provide adequate holding power, you must consider scope. It is a major factor that determines whether your anchor will, in fact, hold or drag. Too short a scope can destroy the efficiency of the best anchor.

Although some books use the term “scope” to refer to the length of anchor rode in use, most often it is recognized as the ratio of the length of the anchor rode to the height of the bow above the bottom of the body of water, as shown in Figure 9-19. Note two important factors: the height of the bow chocks above the surface, and the range of the tide.

Figure 9-19 Scope, the ratio of rode length L to the distance D, from the bow to the bottom (1), is critically important to safe anchoring. At (2) the rode length is twice the distance D, but the angle of pull tends to pull the anchor free. At (4), with L four times D, the anchor can dig in, but there is still too much upward pull on the rode. At (8), scope 8:1, the short length of chain at the anchor lies flat on the bottom, and any pull acts to pull the anchor in deeper.

Let’s assume you anchor in 10 feet of water with 60 feet of rode paid out. At first glance, this is a reasonable scope of 6:1. But if your bow chock is 5 feet above the surface, the ratio is immediately cut to 4:1 (60:15). Six hours later the tide has risen another 5 feet and now you have an actual scope of 3:1 (60:20), exactly half the planned ratio and much too slight for safety.

#### What Is a Proper Scope?

Under favorable conditions using nylon line, 5:1 might be considered a minimum; under average conditions, 7 or 8:1 is regarded as satisfactory. Tests show that proper scope ratios range between 5:1 and 10:1, the latter for heavy weather. Even in a very hard blow in an exposed anchorage, you will probably never need a scope of more than 15:1 with an anchor of suitable holding power. Effective scope for given conditions varies with the type of anchor. In our hypothetical example above, allowing for the range of tide, the length of rode paid out should have been 140 (7:1) to 160 (8:1) feet; 100 feet (5:1) might be regarded as a minimum.

With all-chain rodes, a scope from 3:1 to 5:1 is adequate for all normal conditions.

For maximum efficiency, all anchors require a low angle of pull—preferably less than 8° from the horizontal. With short scope, holding power is reduced because the angle of pull is too high, tending to break out the anchor. As the pull is brought down more nearly parallel with the bottom, flukes dig in deeper with heavier strains on the line. Surging, as a boat pitches in a sea, throws a great load on the anchor, particularly on a short scope. With long scope, the angle of pull is not only more horizontal at the anchor, but the elasticity of a long nylon line cushions the shock loads significantly.

#### Marking a Line for Scope

Granting that we know how much scope is required, how do we know when we have paid out enough? Estimates are risky. Plastic cable markers (see Figure 9-20), come in sets to mark various lengths, such as 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, and 200 feet (or corresponding metric lengths), and are attached by inserting them under a strand or two of the line. In daylight such markers are fine, but in the dark, the traditional markers of strips of leather, bits of cotton or flannel cloth, and pieces of marline with knots are easier to “read” by feel. Plastic markers have the further disadvantage of being rapidly chewed up by anchor windlasses.

Figure 9-20 Numbered plastic markers can be inserted in laid line to indicate the amount of rode let out. Alternatively, colored rings can be painted on the rode.

For all practical purposes, five or six marks at intervals of 20 feet (6 m) (say from 60–140 feet; 18–42.6 m) should be adequate. One practical method is to paint wide and narrow bands of a red vinyl liquid called Whip-End Dip at significant points, calling wide bands 50 feet (15.2 m), narrow ones 10 (3 m). On chain rodes, as a measure of scope, some boaters paint links white at intervals.

If you anchor frequently in the same harbor areas, you may want to put a whipping—wrapping the line with twine or thread—to prevent chafe at two or three predetermined places on the rode; see Chapter 23, this page.

## ANCHORING TECHNIQUES

Thus far we have discussed equipment and ground tackle. Let’s now consider technique—the art of anchoring. Before you can think about how to anchor, however, you must decide where you will anchor, and here, as in all phases of seamanship, a little foresight pays off handsomely.

### Selecting an Anchorage

There will be times when you will stop briefly in open water, for lunch, for a swim, to fish, or perhaps to watch a race—but more often the challenge in finding an anchorage comes down to choosing a spot where you will feel comfortable anchoring for the night when no one will be on watch. You will want a spot where there’s good holding bottom, with protection from the current and forecast wind and waves, in water of suitable depth.

Types of bottoms vary widely, and there are good (though perhaps not “best”) types of anchors for each bottom. Since it is impractical to carry the optimum anchor for every type of bottom, it is necessary to select an area that best fits one of the anchors that you do have on board.

#### Using a Chart

A chart is the best guide in selecting a suitable location. Alternatively, cruising guides for many boating areas often name anchorages that have been used and found suitable. Sometimes you will be able to find a harbor protected on all sides, regardless of wind shifts. If not, the next best choice would be a cove offering protection at least from the existing direction of the wind or the quarter from which it is expected to come. As a last resort, anchorage may be found under a windward bank or shore—that is, where the wind blows from the land toward the boat. In these latter two cases, watch for wind shifts, which could leave you in a dangerous berth on a lee shore.

Anchorages are sometimes designated on charts with an anchor symbol. Areas delineated on the chart by solid magenta lines, perhaps with the water area marked with yellow buoys, may be designated (U.S. inland waters only) as special anchorage areas, where anchor lights are not required on vessels less than 65.6 feet (20 m) in length; see Figure 9-21. Never anchor in cable or pipeline areas (indicated on charts by broken magenta lines) or in channels.

Figure 9-21 There are “special anchorage areas” in U.S. inland waters where anchor lights and shapes are not required on vessels less than 65.6 feet (20 m) in length. These are shown on charts; the boundaries may or may not be marked by buoys.

Adequate but shallow depths are preferred for an anchorage, because a given amount of rode will then provide a greater scope for better holding. A depression or slope in the bottom will allow the anchor to be set so it is an uphill pull, increasing the holding power. You must consider the range of tide, however, so that a falling level does not leave you aground or bottled up behind a shoal with insufficient depth to get out at low water. You also must be alert to the special problems of reversing tidal currents, if such exist where you are anchoring.

#### Characteristics of the Bottom

The character of the bottom is of prime importance. While the type and design of anchor flukes have a direct bearing on its ability to penetrate, it may be stated broadly that mixtures of mud and clay, or sandy mud, make an excellent holding bottom for most anchors. Firm sand is good if your anchor will bite deeply into it; loose sand is undesirable. Soft mud should be avoided if possible. Rocks prevent an anchor from getting a bite except when a fluke is lodged in a crevice. Grassy bottoms, while they provide good holding for the anchor that can get through to firm bottom, often prevent a fluke from taking a hold on anything but the grass, which then pulls out by its roots.

Sometimes bottoms that would otherwise provide reasonably good holding are covered with a thick growth of vegetation that positively destroys the holding power of any anchor. Even if you happen to carry one of the fisherman’s sand-anchor types, with its thin spidery arm and small flukes, expect it to pick up half a bushel of this growth. All you can do is clean it off and try elsewhere.

Characteristics of the bottom are normally shown on charts; see Figure 9-22. Abbreviations for some bottom characteristics are shown in Table 9-2.

Figure 9-22 Aids to navigation, preferably fixed, not buoys, or any pair of charted objects that form a range are useful in selecting an anchorage spot and as a means of checking to make sure that the anchor is not dragging. An ideal anchoring spot is at the intersection of the two improvised ranges shown above.

Table 9-2 Knowledge of the character of the bottom is important in anchoring. Charts provide this information by the use of abbreviations, some of which are shown above.

### How to Anchor

Having selected a suitable spot, run in slowly, preferably on some range ashore selected from marks identified on the chart, or referring your position to visible buoys and landmarks to aid you in locating the chosen spot. Use of two ranges will give you the most precise positioning; refer to Figure 9-22. Later these aids will also be helpful in determining whether you are holding or dragging, especially if the marks are visible at night and it begins to blow after dark.

If there are rocks, shoals, reefs, or other boats to consider, give them all as wide a berth as possible, keeping in mind a possible swing of 360° about the anchor with wind shifts or current changes.

Remember, too, that large yachts nearby may swing to a much longer scope than you deploy—and, conversely, that you may swing much farther than a smaller craft nearby lying on shorter rode. A vessel anchored by chain will normally have a lesser scope and thus a smaller swinging circle. A boat on a permanent mooring will have the smallest movement of all. Observe how the boats that will be your neighbors are anchored or moored, visualize how you will swing with your intended scope, and don’t get into a situation of overlapping swinging circles.

The risk of fouling a neighboring boat is aggravated when, in a current, a deep-draft vessel holds her position while a light-draft boat swings to a shift of wind not strong enough to influence the other. Keel sailboats may lie one way in a light current, powerboats in another way.

A boat that has already established her location in an anchorage has a prior claim to the spot and can’t be expected to move if you later find yourself in an embarrassing position. Consequently, allow room enough so that you can pay out more scope if necessary in case of a blow, without being forced, perhaps at night, to change your anchor spot.

The way other boats lie, together with the set of nearby buoys, will help to determine how you should round up to the chosen spot. Estimate the relative effects of wind and current on your own boat and come up slowly, against the stronger of these forces—in other words, heading as you expect to lie after dropping back on the anchor. Running through the anchorage, take care that your speed is reduced to a point where your wake will not disturb other boats.

#### Letting the Anchor Go

These preliminaries disposed of, you are ready to let go the anchor. Unless you are boating single-handed, station one person on the forward deck. (Never anchor a small boat by the stern—the freeboard is less and swamping is much more likely to happen.) Enough line should be hauled out of the locker and coiled down so as to run freely without kinking or fouling. If previously detached, the line must be shackled to the ring, and the stock set up (if of the stock type) and keyed. Many an anchor has been lost for failure to attach the rode properly. Rodes, too, have gone with the anchor when not secured at the bitter end. Most modern anchors are always ready for use and do not have to be set up, but always check to see that the shackle is properly fastened.

Despite what may be seen all too often, an anchor should not be lowered when your boat has any headway at all. In a motorboat or a sailboat under power, the bow should be brought slowly up to the spot where the anchor is to lie, and headway checked with reverse power. Then, just as the boat begins to gather sternway slowly in reverse, the anchor is lowered easily over the side until it hits bottom, crown first. (Anchoring under sail only is covered on this page.)

Never stand in the coils of line on deck, and don’t attempt to “heave” the anchor by casting it as far as possible from the side of the boat. Occasionally, with judgment, a light anchor in a small boat can be carefully thrown a short distance if such action is required—taking care that it lands in its holding position—but the best all-round rule is to lower it as described. That way the possibility of fouling is minimized.

#### Setting the Anchor

An anchor must be “set” properly if it is to provide its full holding power. The best techniques for setting an anchor will vary from type to type; only general guidelines can be given here, and you should experiment to determine the best procedures for your boat, your anchors, and your cruising waters.

With the anchor on the bottom and the boat backing down slowly, pay out line (sometimes spoken of as veering) as the boat takes it, preferably with a turn of line around the bitt. When the predetermined length has been paid out, snub the line promptly and the anchor will probably get a quick bite into the bottom. A lightweight, burial type like a Danforth or Fortress is frequently set with a scope as short as 3:1 or 4:1, especially in a soft bottom. Anchors such as a kedge or plow or Bruce seem to set better with a scope of 5:1 to 8:1.

Sometimes the anchor may become shod with a clump of mud or bottom grass adhering to the flukes; in these cases, it is best to lift it, wash it off by dunking at the surface, and try again.

After the anchor is set, you can pay out or take in rode to the proper length for the anchorage, and for the prevailing and expected weather conditions. Scope must be adequate for holding, but in a crowded anchorage you must also consider the other boats.

When you must work single-handed, get your ground tackle ready to let go long before you arrive at the anchorage. Bring the boat up to the chosen spot and then lower the anchor as the boat settles back with wind and current, paying out line as she takes it.

Regardless of the type of anchor, after you have paid out full scope, reverse your engine to apply a back-down load in excess of any anticipated strains. This is particularly important if your boat is to be left unattended.

You must make a positive check that the anchor is holding, and not dragging. If you cannot see bottom, select two objects on the beam that form a natural range and watch for any change in their relationship—if none occurs, your anchor is holding. Another trick is to put your hand on the anchor rode; if it is vibrating, the anchor is dragging. An even simpler method is possible if you are using a buoyed trip line from the crown of your anchor (see this page). When you are applying reverse power to test the anchor’s holding, the float on this line should continue to bob up and down in one spot unaffected by the pull on the anchor rode. If you see the float making a path through the water, you can be sure that your anchor is dragging. In warm, clear tropical waters, it is an excellent practice to put on a mask and fins and “swim to the anchor,” checking visually how well it is buried.

#### Making Fast

After the anchor has gotten a good bite, with proper scope paid out, make the line fast and shut off the motor.

On boats with a forward bitt (or samson post), an excellent way to secure the anchor line is to make two to four full turns around the bitt, and then finish off with a half-hitch around each end of the pin through the bitt. The bitt takes the load and the pin secures the line; this way, the line is more easily taken off the bitt than with a clove hitch or any other hitch. Do not depend on the brake of a windlass to carry the load of an anchor rode.

Where a stout cleat is used to make fast, take a turn around the base, one turn over each horn crossing diagonally over the center of the cleat, and finish with a half-hitch around one horn; see Chapter 23, this page.

The fundamental idea in making fast is to secure in such a manner that the line can neither slip nor jam. If the strain comes on top of a series of turns on a cleat, then you will find it nearly impossible to free the line if you want to change the scope; you must first take the strain off it.

If you must shorten the anchor line, first clear the bitt or cleat of old turns and hitches. Do not place new turns over old ones.

A trick worth using when the sea is so rough that it is difficult to go forward on deck—especially if you are single-handed—is to set up the anchor in the aft cockpit, and lead the line forward on deck through a closed chock and then back aft to the cockpit. (If there are stanchions for lifelines, the lead of the rode from chock to anchor must obviously be outside them.) When you’re ready to let go, the anchor can be dropped on the weather side from the cockpit, with the line running through the bow chock and secured on a cleat at the cockpit.

#### Hand Signals

For anchoring, as for docking, it’s a great help to have another hand on board. Communication between the person on the foredeck and the skipper at the helm can be a challenge, however. With engine and exhaust noise or a howling wind, it’s difficult for the skipper to hear, even though the man on deck can. A helmsman handling the boat from a flying bridge can usually hear better and, from his higher position, can see the trend of the anchor line.

In any case, it helps to have a prearranged set of hand signals. There is no need for standardization on this, as long as the helmsman clearly understands the crew’s instructions. Keep the signals as simple as possible. Motion of the hands, calling for the helmsman to come ahead a little or back down, can take the most obvious form; pointing ahead or aft will do it. Simply holding up a hand palm out—a traffic policeman’s signal—may be used to indicate a “stop” to whatever action is then taking place.

### When the Anchor Drags

Let’s assume that you have anchored with a scope of 7:1, have inspected the rode, and have taken bearings, if possible, as a check on your position. Though the wind has picked up, you turn in, only to be awakened near midnight by the boat rolling. Before you reach the deck you know what has happened: the anchor is dragging, and the bow no longer heads up into the wind.

This calls for instant action, not panic. A quick check on bearings confirms what the roll indicated: You’re dragging, with the wind abeam. Sizing up the situation swiftly, you note that danger is not imminent; there is still plenty of room to leeward and no boats downwind to be fouled. Otherwise you would have to get underway immediately or be prepared to fend off.

The first step in trying to get the anchor to hold is to let out more scope. Don’t just throw over several more fathoms of line; pay it out smoothly, with an occasional sharp pull to try to give it a new bite. If you’re dragging badly and can’t handle the rode with your hands, take a turn around the bitt and snub the line from time to time. If this doesn’t work, start the engine and hold the bow up into the wind with just enough power to take the strain off the rode. This gives the anchor a chance to lie on the bottom and perhaps get a new bite as you ease the throttle and let the boat drift back slowly. If you haven’t held when the scope is 10:1, get the anchor back aboard and try again with your larger storm anchor or in another spot.

#### Sentinel or Buoy?

Suppose, now, that you have no spare storm anchor to fall back on. Can anything be done to increase your holding power? Here we enter an area of controversy with something to be said for two quite different techniques. One has the objective of lowering the angle of pull on the anchor line, and the other the lessening of shock loads on the anchor or on the boat itself. We’ll consider both procedures in turn.

For generations, cruising boaters have used a device known as a sentinel (sometimes called a kellet); see Figure 9-23. In principle, the sentinel is nothing more than a weight sent approximately halfway down the rode to lower the angle of pull on the anchor and put a greater sag (i.e., catenary) in the line that must be straightened out before a load is thrown on the anchor. Working with what comes readily to hand, boaters have shackled or snapped their light anchor to the main anchor line and sent it down the rode with a line attached to its ring, to be stopped at a suitable distance. A pig of ballast or other weight would do as well, provided it could be readily attached. Commercially made devices are available that do this easily and neatly. On the other side of the picture, if a sentinel is to be used, it should be done with ample scope, and every precaution taken to avoid chafing the main rode.

Figure 9-23 A sentinel (kellet) is a weight, typically about 25 pounds (11.3 kg), suspended from the rode to help keep the pull on the anchor as horizontal as possible to prevent dragging in rough weather.

The other school of thought would use a buoy, see Figure 9-24, rather than a weight, claiming that, properly used, the buoy can carry most of the vertical load in an anchoring or mooring system, limiting the baseline load on the boat to the horizontal force required to maintain the boat’s position. The argument is advanced that the buoy permits the boat’s bow to ride up easily over wave crests, rather than be pulled down into them with excessive loads on both rode and anchor.

Figure 9-24 A buoy on the rode helps to act as a shock absorber as it allows the boat’s bow to easily ride up wave crests without excessive strain being transmitted to the anchor.

If a buoy is used, it should be of the type found in a permanent mooring system; see Figure 9-25. Its connection into the anchoring system should be as for a permanent mooring (as discussed on this page), with all strain carried by the rode—this ensures that there is no “weak link.” A proper buoy should be carried on board rather than trusting to a makeshift device improvised under the stress of severe weather.

Figure 9-25 A plastic foam buoy usually transmits the strain through the buoy by a solid rod. There are some models that have the two connecting rings at the same end of the buoy.

#### An Alternate System

The chain and sentinel techniques can be combined. Carry a boat-length of substantial chain and a 25-pound (11.3-kg) pig of lead with a ring bolt cast in it. Stow them away somewhere in lieu of ballast. When the chips are down, with breakers to leeward, shackle the chain to your biggest and best anchor, and the chain in turn to your best and longest nylon rode, with the ring of the pig lead shackled in where chain and nylon join. It cannot be anything but an improvement over the same long scope of nylon without benefit of the extra length of chain and added weight. This would seem to eliminate the twin problems of chafe (at the sentinel) and any tendency to hold the boat’s bow down in the surge of pitching seas.

### Getting Underway

When you are ready to weigh anchor and get underway, run up to the anchor slowly under power, so that the line can be taken in easily without hauling the boat up to it. Ordinarily the anchor will break out readily when the line stands vertically. If your craft is equipped with an anchor windlass, do not use it to pull the boat forward, use it only to take in anchor rode as it becomes slack.

As the line comes in, you can whip it up and down to free it of any grass or weeds before it comes on deck. If the anchor is not too heavy, wash off mud by swinging it back and forth and dunking it up and down near the surface as it leaves the water. With care, the line can be snubbed around a bitt and the anchor allowed to wash off as the boat gathers way, preferably sternway. Two things must be watched: don’t allow the flukes to hit the topsides, and be careful that water flowing past the anchor doesn’t get too good a hold and take it out of your hands.

Although nylon anchor line will not be harmed by stowing without drying, it is undesirable to carry this additional moisture below decks. Coil the line loosely on deck and allow it to dry, but expose it to sunlight no longer than necessary.

In all anchor handling, try to avoid letting the anchor hit the hull at any time. Whether your boat is made of fiberglass, metal, or wood, some gouges, dents, or nicks may result. Guests are often eager to “help” by getting the anchor up, but unless they have had some experience, it’s better to handle this part of the job yourself. Handle and stow lines carefully. If a bight or end of line slips over the side it is certain to run back under the bottom and get fouled in the propeller.

In a boat under sail alone, have your mainsail up before you break the anchor loose. Proceed as above. There is no motor to help, but it is possible to use your sails to assist. See this page for details.

If you have been anchored for a day or two in a brisk wind, the anchor may be dug in deeply. Don’t wait until you’re ready to get underway; 20 minutes or so before departure, shorten the scope—but keep a sharp watch. The boat’s motion will tend to loosen the anchor’s hold and save a lot of work when you finally go to break it out and raise it.

#### Clearing a Fouled Anchor

If an anchor refuses to break out when you haul vertically on the line, snub it around the bitt and go ahead with the engine a few feet. If the anchor doesn’t respond to this treatment, it may have fouled under some obstruction. First try pulling on the line from the opposite direction with moderate scope, about 2:1 or 3:1; see Figure 9-26. If this doesn’t free it, try making fast to the bitt and running slowly in a wide circle on a taut line. Changing the angle of pull may free it, or a turn of line may foul an exposed end of the stock or a fluke (if it’s a kedge) and draw it out.

Figure 9-26 If your anchor fouls on a rocky bottom, your first attempt to free it should be by reversing the original direction of pull (left) with moderate scope, to draw it out (right).

Probably the best way to break out of a fouled anchor is with a buoyed trip line—if you have been wise enough to rig one beforehand. Use a light line, but one that is strong enough to stand the pull of a snagged anchor—⅜-inch (10-mm) polypropylene (which floats) is a typical choice. Attach this line to the crown of the anchor (in some models an eye is provided for this; a hole can be drilled in one of the crown plates of a Danforth or similar anchor). The trip line should be just long enough to reach the surface in waters in which you normally anchor, with allowance for tidal changes. Pass the line through a wooden or foam float (you can even use a plastic disposable bottle if it has a handle) and end the line in a small eye-splice that can be caught with a boathook. If the anchor doesn’t trip in a normal manner, pick up the trip line and haul the anchor up crown first.

If you haven’t rigged a trip line, sometimes you can run a length of chain down the anchor line, rigged so that another boat can use her power to haul in a direction opposite that in which the anchor line tends, thus changing the angle of pull 180°. With kedges, if one fluke is exposed, a chain handled between dinghies can usually be worked down the rode to catch the upper arm and draw the anchor out crown first.

If the anchor is not fouled in something immovable but merely set deeply in heavy clay, you can generally break it out by securing the line at low water and allowing a rising tide to exert a steady strain. Or, if there is a considerable ground swell, snub the line when the bow pitches low in a trough. There’s some risk of parting the line this way, in case the fluke is fouled worse than you think.

There is a type of anchor in which the ring is free to slide the full length of shank. Properly rigged, it is claimed to be virtually snag-proof; see Figure 9-27. If the anchor should snag, the theory is that when the boat is brought back over the anchor, the sliding ring can slip down the shank so the anchor will be drawn backward. There is, however, some risk; if there should be a near-180° shift of wind or current, the anchor might pull out when you wanted it to hold. Some models have an eye at the end of the shank separate from the slot; if the anchor line is attached there, the anchor functions in the normal manner.

Figure 9-27 On the Hooker Quik-Set anchor, the rode is attached to a ring that slides in a slot in the shank, allowing the anchor to be drawn out backward if necessary. For use when snagging is unlikely, the rode can be shackled directly to the eye at the end of the shank.

### Using Two Anchors

For increased holding power in a blow, two anchors are sometimes set. If your working anchor drags, you can run out your spare storm anchor without picking up the working anchor. The important thing to remember is to lay them out at an angle, not in line, to reduce the risk of having one dragging anchor cut a trough in the bottom for the other to follow; see Figure 9-28.

Figure 9-28 If two anchors are set out ahead of a boat, it is best to have the rodes at a wider angle, as at A, rather than nearly in a line, as at B, to reduce the possibility of their fouling each other as the boat swings to wind or current.

Special care is necessary for a boat with two anchors out if she is subject to extreme wind shifts, as might occur with the passage of a squall line. A change of pull on the anchor lines of 180°, more or less, can bring the two rodes into contact with each other in such a way that neither anchor will hold or reset if pulled out. In some situations, one anchor is actually safer than two!

When setting two anchors, make the rodes fast separately to two bitts or cleats. Do not put one rode on top of the other, in case you have to make adjustments later.

#### To Reduce Yawing

Deep-draft sailboats usually lie reasonably well head to the wind, but many motorboats and some fin-keel sailboats “tack” back and forth at anchor, which is called yawing. Skiffs, with high freeboard and little draft forward, are among the worst offenders in this respect.

You can lessen yawing by laying two anchors, lines leading out from either bow, making an angle of about 45° between them. To do this, let one anchor down first and have a crewman tend the line carefully as you maneuver the bow off to one side before letting the other go. Then you can settle back on both lines, adjusting scope as necessary.

With skillful handling, you can get two anchors down single-handed. The easiest way is to settle back on one anchor, making fast when the proper scope has been paid out. Then power ahead slowly, with the rudder over enough to hold the line out taut so you can keep an eye on it at all times. When the line stands out abeam, stop your headway, go to the foredeck and let the other anchor go, then drop back, snub the line to set the anchor, and finally, adjust the lines to equal scope.

If a dinghy is available, the second anchor can be carried out in it; the coiled anchor line should be in the stern of the dinghy so that it pays out freely as you move away from your boat. If an attempt were made to pay out the line from the deck of the boat, the dinghy might well become unmanageable when conditions include a wind or strong current. Both rodes should be adjusted as required after the two anchors are set.

#### Guard Against Wind or Current Shifts

Sometimes you will need to anchor where the tidal current reverses, or wide wind shifts are likely. Here it is wise to set two anchors as security against an anchor breaking out and failing to set itself again.

The anchors are set 180° apart with the bow of the boat at the midpoint between them; see Figure 9-29. With both lines drawn up tight, the bow remains over essentially the same spot, and swinging is limited to the boat’s length. This “Bahamian moor” works best for a reversing tidal current with the wind blowing across the current so as to keep the boat always on one side of the line between the two anchors. When setting a second anchor for such a mooring, set the up-current anchor in the conventional way and then back down until double the normal scope is out. After the down-current anchor is set, adjust the scope at the bow chocks by powering forward until both are equal. When going ahead with a rode tending aft, take care not to foul the propeller.

Figure 9-29 When anchoring in a narrow waterway with reversing tidal current, two anchors should be set from the bow in a “Bahamian moor,” as shown. Adequate scope should be used on each anchor, with the rodes adjusted so that there is no slack in one when the other is taut.

If the two-anchor technique is used in a crowded anchorage to limit your swinging radius, remember that other nearby boats may lie to one anchor only. Since your swing will not be in sync with theirs, the risk of having their swinging circles overlap your limited swing is increased.

#### Stern Anchors

In some anchorages, boats may lie to anchors bow and stern. The easiest way to get these down is to let the bow anchor go first, and then drop back with wind or current on an extra long scope, drop the stern anchor, and then adjust the scope on both as necessary, taking in line forward. In tidal waters, just as with a single anchor, make allowance for increasing depth as the tide rises. The value of this arrangement is generally restricted to areas where permanent moorings are set explicitly for this purpose, as in narrow streams, or on occasions where there is no risk of getting a strong wind or current abeam. Under such conditions, the strain on a vessel’s ground tackle could be excessive.

Sometimes a stern anchor will be useful if you seek shelter under a windward bank. Let the stern anchor go from aft, carefully estimating scope as it is dropped, and pay out more scope as you run up toward the bank or beach. Bed a second anchor securely in the bank, or take a line to a structure or tree ashore. The stern anchor will keep the stern off and prevent the boat from ranging ahead. But, again, watch that stern line while the propeller is turning!

#### At Piers & Wharves

Docking on the windward side of a pier or wharf is undesirable, as considerable damage can be done to a boat pounding heavily against piles, even with fenders in place. Anchors can help to ease the situation in a case where such a berth is unavoidable. Keeping well up to windward, angling into the wind as much as is practicable, have someone drop an anchor on a long scope off the quarter (the port quarter if you’ll lie starboard side to the pier). As this line is paid out, run ahead and get another anchor off the port bow, judging positions of both so you can drop down to leeward toward the pier on equal scope, with lines tending off at a 45° angle. Properly executed, this maneuver will prevent your vessel from hitting the pier, and the lines you then carry ashore will be needed only to prevent the boat from moving ahead or astern. Have your fenders out well in advance and be alert to relocate them as required.

Figure 9-30 In rafting, only one boat should be anchored. The other boats are made fast to it so that all will move as a unit. Raft only in light breezes and in calm water.

#### Rafting

At a rendezvous, several boats frequently lie to a single anchor. Sometimes as many as ten or more boats raft together (rather too many for safety even in a quiet cove). After one boat is anchored, the second pulls alongside with plenty of fenders out on both. Stay six to ten feet away from the anchored boat and heave bow and stern lines. If this can’t be done, run up to the anchored boat’s bow at an angle of about 45° and pass a bow line first, then your stern line. Make sure you have no headway when lines are passed. As soon as the bow line is across to the anchored boat, stop your engine so that there will be no chance of going ahead, breaking the anchor out.

For a powerboat—but not a sailboat—you would allow your boat to drift astern until transoms align. Because of the dangers of spreaders tangling in a rocking situation, it’s best to line up rafting sailboats so that the rigging is clear at all points aloft. Then let the bow swing off and pull the sterns in close so it will be easier to step from one boat to another. To keep the boats in line and fenders in position, run a spring line from the stern of the arriving boat to a point well forward on the anchored boat. A second spring line in the opposite direction is useful.

If a third boat makes fast, the anchored boat should be in the middle; if more tie up, always alternate them port and starboard of the anchored boat. Each succeeding boat should use the same technique, always with a spring from the stern of the outboard boat forward to the one next inboard. Keels of all boats in the group should be nearly parallel. For safety, boats should raft only when there is little wind and a relatively smooth surface. When four or more are tied together, it is a good precaution for the outboard boats to carry additional anchors out at a 45° angle.

Before darkness sets in, the raft should break up and each boat anchor separately.

### Special Situations

Although the foregoing sections have covered nearly all the problems in anchoring, there are still a few that might be termed “special situations.”

#### Anchoring at Night

When anchoring after daylight has passed, if you have no ranges to check your position (or if those you have are unlighted), you can rig a drift lead (the lead line will do). Lower it to the bottom, leave some slack for swinging, and make fast. If it comes taut, you’ve dragged. Don’t forget to pick it up before getting underway. Many electronic navigation systems include an “anchor alarm” that will sound if your boat moves from the designated location by more than an amount that you have preset.

In general, vessels anchored at night must show an anchor light, two lights if the vessel is over 50 meters (164 ft) in length. Anchor lights are not required, however, for vessels under 20 meters (65.6 ft) in a “special anchorage area,” or for craft less than 7 meters (23 ft) when not in a channel, fairway, or where other vessels normally navigate. See details, this page.

#### Requirements for “Anchor Ball”

With the same exceptions as noted above for anchor lights, a vessel anchored during daylight hours must hoist a black ball shape where it can best be seen. This shape must be not less than 0.6 meter (23.6 in) in diameter for ships, but may be of lesser size for small craft; see this page.

#### Rocky Bottoms

Earlier, certain steps that could be taken to clear a fouled anchor were discussed. Avoid rocky bottoms or those with coral heads; they are hazardous at best, regardless of the type of anchor used. Before leaving a boat unattended, apply a test load to the anchor well in excess of any expected load.

If you normally anchor in rocky bottoms or suspect that the bottom is foul in the area where you must anchor, it is better to forestall trouble. One time-tested device is the buoyed trip line described on this page.

An alternate scheme is to scow the anchor by attaching the rode to the crown, leading it back along the shank, and stopping it to the ring with a light lashing of marline; see Figure 9-31. With sufficient scope, the strain is on the rode and not on the lashing. When hove up short, the strain is on the lashing. When this parts, the anchor comes up crown first.

Figure 9-31 When “scowing” an anchor, the rode is attached to the anchor crown, led back along the shank, and lashed at the ring. If the anchor becomes snagged (A), an upward pull (B) breaks the lashing and the anchor can be drawn out crown first (C).

#### Kedging off a Shoal

The term kedging is applied to the use of a light anchor (not necessarily a kedge-type) carried out to deep water in a dinghy to haul a stranded boat off a shoal. If you ever have to resort to this, make sure the line is in the dinghy rather than on deck. See also Chapter 10, this page.

#### Anchoring for a Sailboat

The procedures used for selecting and approaching an anchorage are the same for a sailboat skipper as for the operator of a powerboat. There are some differences in lowering and setting the anchor; these are covered in Chapter 8, this page.

### Some Cautions

Take great care to avoid chafe on fiber lines. Wherever the line comes in contact with chocks or rails and rubs back and forth under continuous strain, outer fibers may be worn to such an extent as to seriously weaken the line. Mooring pennants are particularly susceptible to this, as are dock lines.

When lying at anchor, you can “freshen the nip” by paying out a little more scope from time to time, or protect the line at the point of chafe with strips of canvas wrapped around it.

Modern chafing gear is available in the form of plastic or rubber sleeves that can be snapped over the line, centered in a chock, and seized with thongs on either side to prevent shifting; see Figure 9-32. Chafing gear also comes in the form of lacing line or a white waterproof tape, to be applied around the line at bitts, chocks, and other points of contact.

Figure 9-32 Split plastic tubing can be used to cover a line where it passes through chocks to protect it against abrasion.

The increasing use of relatively light anchor rodes of small diameter (as small as ⅜ inch) points up the necessity of preventing chafe. Chafe that a ¾-inch line could tolerate might render a ⅜-inch line unsafe.

#### Chocks, Bitts, Cleats & Other Fittings

Chafe is aggravated wherever a fitting has a rough surface to accelerate abrasion of the fibers. Even small nicks and scratches in a chock can damage a line by cutting fibers progressively, one at a time. Serious weakening of a line develops when it is forced to pass around any fitting with relatively sharp corners, such as a square bitt with only a minimum rounding of the edges, especially when the bitts are too small for their job. Theoretically, the ideal bitt or samson post is round and of generous diameter. The best chocks are those of special design with the largest possible radius at the arc where the line passes over it.

Mooring bitts especially must be fastened securely. The best bitt is the old-fashioned wooden bitt, long enough to have its heel fastened solidly to the boat’s keel. If a cast fitting is used on deck, it must be through-bolted and the deck below reinforced with a husky backing plate; see Figure 9-33.

Figure 9-33 Two substantial, well-rounded samson posts are shown on either side of the deck forward of an electric windlass. Note the horizontal norman pin that keeps the line from slipping up and off.

#### Protection from Ultraviolet Ray Damage

The outer layers of all types of rope are subject to some degree of damage from ultraviolet rays that are part of the normal spectrum of sunlight. With nylon line of relatively large diameter (upward of ¾ inch), such damage is probably negligible. As the diameter decreases, the problem becomes proportionately more serious; in ⅜-inch nylon it is an important factor because so much of the line is in the outer fibers. Take special care to shield such lines from unnecessary exposure to direct sunlight. Often the rode can be fed down into a locker. If it must be carried on deck, shade it or periodically replace it and assign the old line to less critical uses.

## PERMANENT MOORINGS

Permanent moorings, as distinguished from ordinary ground tackle, consist of the gear used when boats are to be left unattended for long periods, such as at yacht clubs or municipal anchorages. The traditional system often consists of a mushroom anchor, chain from the anchor to a buoy, and a pennant of stainless steel or nylon from the buoy to a light pick-up float at the pennant’s end; see Figure 9-34.

Figure 9-34 In this diagram of mooring practice recommended by the Lake Michigan Yachting Association, total scope is the combined length of heavy chain, light chain, and pennant. Minimum space between adjacent moorings should be 1.25 times the total scope plus the length of any boat likely to use the mooring. Be sure the chain or rod running through the buoy is of sufficient strength. Otherwise, connect the pennant directly to the light chain below the buoy.

Mushroom anchors, especially the type with a heavy bulb cast in the shank, can, through suction, develop great holding power under ideal conditions if they have enough time to bury deeply into bottoms that permit such burying; see Figure 9-35. Unfortunately, ideal bottom conditions are not always present. Often large cast-concrete blocks, similar to those used by the Coast Guard to moor buoys, are put down in lieu of mushroom anchors.

Figure 9-35 Mushroom anchors can develop great holding power under ideal conditions if they have enough time to bury deeply.

Complicating the problem is the fact that anchorages are becoming increasingly crowded so that boats cannot have adequate scope because of overlapping swinging circles. Add to this the threat of abnormally high hurricane tides, which reduce scope to a ratio allowing no safety factor, and you have contributing factors to the devastation wrought by several hurricanes along the Atlantic Coast.

### Typical Mooring Systems

The problem faced by the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club at Port Washington, NY, was typical. Here about 200 boats were to be moored in a limited space. If each boat could use a length of chain equal to 5 to 7 times the depth of water (maximum 20 feet), safety would be assured, but this would require a swinging radius of several hundred feet for each boat, which was not feasible. After exhaustive study, the Manhasset boaters prepared a set of recommended standards, given in Table 9-3. A generally similar system was adopted by the Lake Michigan Yachting Association; refer to Figure 9-34.

Table 9-3 Specifications for mooring system used at the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club.

#### Guest Moorings

Often a cruising skipper will find guest moorings available at yacht clubs and municipal anchorages and at some marinas. The dockmaster or launch operator will know which of those not in use for the night are heavy enough to hold your boat. As a rule, it’s easier and safer to pick up such a mooring rather than anchoring. In most places, a charge will be made for the use of the mooring, and for launch service if desired.

#### Mooring Buoys

To comply with U.S. Coast Guard regulations, mooring buoys should be white with a horizontal blue band. Buoys used in any mooring system should be of a type that transmits strain directly through the buoy, using chain or rod of acceptable strength; refer to Figure 9-25. Buoys perform a useful function in removing much of the vertical load; the pennant is under a more nearly horizontal load, and the boat’s bow is freer to lift to heavy seas.

Stainless-steel pennants are often preferred because of failures traceable to the chafing of fiber pennants. When fiber is used for the pennant, protect it with chafing gear, especially if there is a bobstay against which it can saw; refer to Figure 9-32.

#### Annual Inspection Necessary

Because ordinary moorings often need a period of time for silting-in before achieving their full holding power, annual inspection of chain, links, shackles, and pins should be made early in the season—never pick up for checking just about the time storm warnings are issued. On the other hand, it is also wise to give the pennant from buoy to boat a double-check in mid-season, just before the August-September months when hurricanes most often strike along the East Coast.

#### Screw-in Moorings

Recent technology has been developed for permanent moorings, promising greater security for craft exposed to the forces of hurricanes and other major storms. In lieu of a heavy anchor or sinker on the bottom, a helical anchor is literally screwed into the bottom much as a cork-puller is screwed into the cork of a wine bottle. Tests have shown that a helical anchor provides three to five times the holding power of a typical mushroom anchor or concrete block. They are particularly useful in situations where the bottom is rocky or too hard to let a mushroom anchor bury itself, or where the bottom is too soft for a mushroom anchor to develop enough holding power.

Typical helical anchors are made of 1¾-inch galvanized steel rod fashioned into helices of 8-, 10-, 12-, or 14-inch diameter. These anchors are installed using special machinery mounted on a barge, and both skill and experience is required for proper installation. Measurements of the force required to screw the anchor into the bottom can be used to predict the holding power; additional sections can be added if it is necessary to force the anchor down deeper. Smaller helical anchors for small boats can be installed by a diver.

### Picking Up & Leaving a Mooring

Approach a mooring buoy in the same manner as you would an anchorage spot, as previously described in this chapter—slowly and into the prevailing wind or current, whichever has the stronger effect on your craft. A person on the bow will need a boathook with which to pick up the pennant streaming from the buoy. Typically, this line will have an eye that can be placed over the forward bitt or samson post. Often, however, the pennant is a polypropylene line (so that it will float on the surface) that has accumulated considerable marine growth—this can be quite messy on the crew’s hands and on the foredeck. A solution is to use a short length of braided nylon line with an eye in one end. Place the eye of this line on the bitt, and, when the pennant is hauled up to deck level on the boat hook, pass the other end of the braided line through the eye of the pennant and then back to a bitt or forward cleat—this allows the fouled pennant to drop back down clear of your boat.

Departing a mooring should be no problem; just keep clear of the mooring buoy that you are leaving and other nearby craft. The person on the bow can lift the eye of the pennant off the bitt and drop it overboard; if an additional line has been used as suggested above, the free end can be uncleated and pulled back, dropping the pennant. It is best to just let the wind or current carry you away from the buoy, but a touch of reverse engine power may be used if necessary; the person on the bow can signal the helmsman as to the location of the mooring buoy until it can be seen from the helm.

Picking up a mooring, or getting away from one, with a sailboat is covered on this page.

##### GROUND TACKLE MAINTENANCE

A boat’s ground tackle includes all the anchors, anchor rodes (nylon line or chain), and shackles that are used to connect components together into an anchor system. Adequate ground tackle is essential to the safety of a vessel of any size. Unfortunately, time and use take their toll. Proper inspection and care are required to get the greatest possible life out of any component of an anchoring system.

At least once a year, every set of ground tackle should be hosed clean, and the chain and rode should be checked for any deterioration. All shackles (and swivels, if used) should be closely examined. All pins should be safetied with stainless wire or nylon cable ties to keep them from working loose; replace each safety tie once a year.

The rope/chain locker should be cleaned out. Ensure that the bitter end of each working anchor rode is securely fastened to prevent the accidental loss of the anchor and rode.

###### FIBER LINES

Keep fiber lines free from sand and grit. Use a low-pressure hose to wash off grit, or slosh the line overboard, tied in a loose coil. Don’t use a high-pressure nozzle—it may force grit deeper into the line.

Make sure that lines are straight before any load is applied. Placing a strain on a kinked line can damage or break the fibers. To a lesser degree, sharp bends are harmful; blocks should always have sheaves of adequate diameter; see this page.

Inspect all lines regularly. Check the effect of abrasion, cuts, rust on nylon, broken or frayed yarns, variations in strand size or shape, burns, rot and/or acid stains, and fiber “life.” Nylon line may fuzz on the surface although the yarns are not broken. This seems to act as a cushion, reducing further outside abrasion.

Compare the line to new rope. Untwist and examine the buried strands; they should be clean and bright as in new rope. If powder or broken fibers appear, the line has been overloaded or subject to excessive bending. Nylon may be fused or melted, either inside or out, from overloads.

Check any splices. All splices should have absolute integrity. (For complete safety, the only splice in an anchor rode should be the eye splice connecting the rode to the chain near the anchor.)

Most chafe and wear comes on the anchor end. Periodically, lines in regular use should be turned end-for-end. If you use one size for all anchor and mooring lines, you can put a new spare anchor line aboard each spring, put the former spare into regular use, and make the oldest anchor line into dock lines after cutting out any damaged sections.

Become familiar with the special techniques that are required in working with nylon line, as when making up eye splices or even unreeling it from a coil. These techniques are covered in detail in Chapter 23.

###### ANCHORS & CHAIN

Consider the appearance of your anchors. Galvanized anchors are usually coated by the hot-dip process that leaves a tough protective finish, and normally require no care except washing off mud. You can buy a spray coating that is heavy in zinc, a “cold galvanize.” This coating will temporarily improve the appearance of anchor and chain that are starting to rust, but it has poor wearing qualities when compared to hot-dip galvanizing.

Don’t store a dirty anchor chain. If it comes up fouled with mud, give it a thorough cleaning. Some larger yachts have a faucet and hose near the bow connected to a fresh- or salt-water pressure system for this purpose. You will find a long-handled brush helpful for this procedure.

###### PERIODIC INSPECTION

Check the entire length of each rode for signs of deterioration. Does the galvanizing on the chain need to be renewed? A chain pitted by rust can become unsafe. Check all thimbles, shackles, and especially swivels for security. If necessary, replace the safety wiring. Be sure the bitter end of the anchor rode is securely fastened to a strong point in the anchor locker. If the rode is chain, use a length of rope long enough to reach the deck so it can be cut in an emergency.

### A Multiple-Anchor System

One hurricane that ravaged the North Atlantic Coast swept through an anchorage in the New York area and tore almost every boat from her moorings. Only two survived. What these two had in common was an “unconventional” mooring system—multiple (3) anchors bridled to a common center, with chain and pennant leading from that point to the boat.

The obvious advantages of the system are shown in Figure 9-36. Regardless of how the wind shifts, the boat swings through a small circle, despite the advantage of a relatively long total scope from the boat to the anchor. The short rode up from the three-way bridle minimizes any “tacking” tendency. Always there will be one or two anchors to windward, the strain tending in the same direction. Using modern lightweight anchors instead of mushrooms, the greater the load, the deeper they bury. Mushrooms often need a relatively long period to bed-in securely, but lightweight anchors will dig in almost immediately. Next to each anchor, use a heavy chain with a length one and a half times the maximum depth of the water—the objective is to have a three-anchor system with a holding power equal to the design holding power of a permanent mooring for the same size craft.

Figure 9-36 A modern permanent mooring system designed to be an improvement over the single mushroom anchor uses three lightweight-type anchors bridled 120° apart. A relatively short rode limits swinging.

SPECIAL SEAMANSHIP TECHNIQUES

Boat Handling Under Adverse Conditions • Running Aground • Assisting & Towing Other Vessels

While boaters would all prefer to be out on the water in pleasant conditions, experienced skippers recognize that sometimes there will be bad weather, they may run aground, or they may need to assist another vessel in trouble. They may encounter emergencies such as a man overboard, fire, or the need to abandon a sinking boat. Every skipper should be thoroughly familiar with the special seamanship techniques presented in this chapter, which are required to safely cope with these conditions. The particulars of specific serious situations aboard, such as man overboard, fire, and abandoning ship, are covered in Chapter 12, “Emergencies Underway.”

## BOAT HANDLING UNDER ADVERSE CONDITIONS

Perhaps the most important test of a skipper’s abilities comes in how he handles his boat in adverse weather conditions. Boat size has little bearing on seaworthiness, which is fixed more by design and construction. The average power cruiser or sailboat is fully seaworthy for normal conditions in the use for which it is intended. Which means: Don’t venture into waters or weather conditions clearly beyond what your boat was designed for. Remember also that what a boat will do is governed to a great extent by the skill of its skipper; a good seaman might bring a poor boat through a blow that a novice could not weather in a far more seaworthy one.

#### Rough Weather

“Rough weather” is a relative term, and what might seem a terrible storm to the fair-weather boater may be nothing more than a good breeze to an experienced, weather-wise skipper.

On large, shallow bodies of water like Long Island’s Great South Bay, Delaware Bay and River, or Lake Erie, even a moderate wind will cause uncomfortable steep waves with breaking crests. Offshore or in deeper inland water, the same wind force might cause moderate waves or slow, rolling swells and would be no menace to small craft; see Figure 10-01.

#### Know Your Boat

Boat handling under adverse conditions is an individual matter, since no two boats are exactly alike in the same sea conditions. When the going gets heavy, each hull design reacts differently—and even individual boats of the same class may behave differently because of factors like load and trim.

Each skipper must learn the particulars of his boat to determine how best to apply the principles covered in the following sections. Reading this book and taking courses are important first steps. You can learn basic good seamanship by absorbing facts and principles, but you’ll have to pick up the rest by using your book and classroom learning on the water when the wind blows.

Even when conditions do not force you to undertake special seamanship techniques, involve yourself with theoretical situations. Ask yourself and your crewmembers how to handle various difficulties. While cruising along on a calm day, for example, ask what each person should do if the boat suddenly ran aground. This not only makes for interesting conversation, but also provides a good basis for practicing procedures.

### Head Seas

The average well-designed power cruiser or larger sailboat should have little difficulty when running generally into head seas. If the seas get too steep-sided or if you start to pound, slow down by easing the throttle or shortening sail. This gives the bow a chance to rise in meeting each wave instead of being driven hard into it. (A direct consequence of driving hard into a wave could be that the force of the water hitting the superstructure would break ports and windows.)

##### PREPARATIONS FOR ROUGH WEATHER

In anticipation of high winds and rough seas, a prudent skipper takes certain precautions. No single list fits all boats or all weather conditions, but among the appropriate actions are those listed below. Storms can be a tremendous test of the knowledge, endurance, courage, and good judgment of the skipper and crew. A well-prepared craft and its crew are more likely to survive a storm.

• Keep your boat’s fuel tank or tanks clean. Rough seas can resuspend sludge from the tank bottom, which could clog your fuel filters and kill your engine just when you need it most.

• Break out life preservers and have everyone on board, including the skipper, wear one before the situation worsens; don’t wait too long.

• Secure all hatches; close all ports and windows. Close off all ventilator openings.

• Pump bilges dry and repeat as required.

• Secure all loose gear; put away small items and lash down larger ones, on deck and especially below.

• Break out emergency gear that you might need—hand pumps or bailers, sea anchor or drogue, etc.

• Make sure that navigation lights are working. Hoist the radar reflector if it is not already rigged. Check batteries in flashlights and electric lanterns.

• Get a good check of your position if possible, and update the plot on your chart.

• Make plans for altering course to sheltered waters if necessary.

• If towing a dinghy, bring it on board and lash it down securely.

• If under power, check the engine room, especially fuel filter bowls.

• If sailing, prepare all reefing lines; set up the storm jib and trysail (see this page) if this can be done independently from the mainsail and headsails. Be ready to change to storm sails quickly. If running before the wind, rig a strong preventer that can be released from the helm. Wear your safety harness at all times; it should fit snugly over your clothing. Especially offshore or at night, a jackline or jacklines should be rigged—see this page. That way, in heavy weather, every crewmember on deck can at all times be attached to padeyes, other strong deck hardware, or a jackline via his or her safety harness tether, even (especially!) when working on the foredeck. Being tethered can be inconvenient, but it’s far better than being washed overboard by a boarding sea. Charge your batteries and avoid unnecessary drains on them until the weather improves.

• Remember that being cold can affect a person’s judgment. Have everyone put on appropriate clothing. Choose clothing that will keep you warm even when wet—wool or polypropylene.

• Give all hands a good meal while you have the opportunity; it might be a while until the next one. Prepare some food in advance; put coffee or soup in a thermos, and store something that can be eaten easily and quickly—perhaps sandwiches—in a watertight container.

• Get out the motion sickness pills; it is much better to take them before you get queasy.

• Reassure your crew and guests; instruct them in what to do and not to do, and then give them something to do to take their minds off the situation.

#### Match Speed to Sea Conditions

If conditions get really bad, slow down until you’re barely making headway, holding your bow at an angle of about 45° to the waves. The more you reduce headway in meeting heavy seas, the less the strain on the hull and superstructure and the less the stress on the persons onboard.

#### Avoid Propeller “Racing”

You must reduce speed to avoid damaging the hull or engine if the seas lift the propeller clear of the water and it “races.” This sounds dangerous—and it may be. First, there’s a rapidly increasing crescendo of sound as the engine winds up, then excessive vibration as the propeller bites the water again. Don’t panic—ease the throttle and change your course until these effects are minimized.

Keep headway so you can maneuver your boat readily. Experiment to find the speed best suited to the conditions.

#### Adjust Trim

You can swamp your boat if you drive it ahead too fast or if it is poorly trimmed. In a head sea, a vessel with too much weight forward will plunge rather than rise. Under the same conditions, too much weight aft will cause it to fall off. The ideal speed will vary with different boats—experiment with your craft and find out its best riding speed.

Change the weight aboard if necessary. On outboards, shift your tanks and other heavy gear. In any boat, direct your passengers and crew to remain where you place them.

#### Meet Each Wave as It Comes

You can make reasonable progress by nursing the wheel—spotting the steep-sided combers coming in and varying your course, slowing or even stopping momentarily for the really big ones. Just as you adjust your speed when driving a car on a winding road, you must vary your boat’s speed to get through waves. If the person at the helm can see clearly and act before dangerous conditions develop, the craft should weather moderate gales with little discomfort. Make sure the most experienced person aboard acts as helmsman, with occasional breaks in order to stay sharp.

### In the Trough

If your course requires you to run broadside to waves or swells, bouncing from crest to trough and back up again, your boat may roll heavily, perhaps dangerously. In these conditions in a powerboat it is best to run a series of “tacks,” much like a sailboat.

#### Tacking Across the Troughs

Change course and take the wind and waves at a 45° angle, first broad on your bow and then broad on your quarter; see Figure 10-02. You will make a zigzag course in the right direction, with your boat broadside to the trough only briefly while turning. With the wind broad on the bow, the boat’s behavior should be satifactory; on the quarter, the motion may be less comfortable, but at least it will be better than running in the trough. Make each tack as long as possible to minimize how often you must pass through the trough.

Figure 10-02 This U.S. Coast Guard utility boat is taking waves at a 45° angle to its stern. With skillful use of power and helm, it will remain under control despite the breaking seas.

To turn sharply, allow your powerboat to lose headway for a few seconds, turn the helm hard over, then suddenly apply power. The boat will turn quickly as a powerful stream of water strikes the rudder, kicking you to port or starboard without making any considerable headway. You won’t be broadside for more than a minimum length of time. This is particularly effective with single-screw boats. With twin-screw powerboats, the engine on the side in the direction of the turn may be throttled back or even briefly reversed.

### Running Before the Sea

If the swells are coming from directly behind you, running directly before them is safe if your boat’s stern can be kept reasonably up to the seas without being thrown around off course. But in heavy seas, a boat tends to rush down a slope from crest to trough, and, stern high, the propeller comes out of the water and races. The rudder also loses its grip, and the sea may take charge of the stern as the bow “digs in.” At this stage, the boat may yaw so badly as to broach—to be thrown broadside, out of control—into the trough. Avoid broaching by taking every possible action. Unfortunately, modern powerboat design emphasizes beam at the stern so as to provide a large, comfortable cockpit or afterdeck, and this width at the transom increases the tendency to yaw and possibly broach.

#### Reducing Yawing

Slowing down to let the swells pass under your boat usually reduces the tendency to yaw, or at least reduces the extent of yawing; see Figure 10-03. While it is seldom necessary, you can consider towing a heavy line or drogue (see this page) astern to help check your boat’s speed and keep it running straight. Obviously the line must be carefully handled and not allowed to foul the propeller. Do not tow soft-laid nylon lines that may unlay and cause hockles (strand kinks).

Figure 10-03 Pitching, rolling, and yawing are normal motions of a boat. If they become excessive, or combine, they may be uncomfortable or even dangerous.

Cutting down engine speed reduces strain on the motor caused by alternate stern-down laboring and stern-high racing.

#### Pitchpoling

The ordinary offshore swell is seldom troublesome when you are running before the seas, but the steep wind waves of some lakes and shallow bays make steering difficult and reduced speed imperative. Excessive speed down a steep slope may cause a boat to pitchpole—that is, drive its head under in the trough, tripping the bow, while the succeeding crest catches the stern and throws her end over end. When the going is bad enough that there is risk of pitchpoling, keep the stern down and the bow light and buoyant, by shifting weight aft as necessary.

Shifting any considerable amount of weight aft will reduce a boat’s tendency to yaw, but too much might cause it to be pooped by a following wave breaking into the cockpit. Do everything in moderation, not in excess. Adjust your boat’s trim bit by bit rather than all at once, and see what makes it more stable.

#### Tacking Before the Seas

Use the tacking technique also when you want to avoid large waves or swells directly astern. Try a zigzag track that puts them alternately off each quarter, minimizing their effects—experiment with slightly different headings to find the most stable angle for your boat—but keep it under control to prevent a broach.

### Running an Inlet

One of the worst places to be in violent weather is an inlet or narrow harbor entrance, where shoal water builds up treacherous surf that often cannot be seen from seaward. Inexperienced boaters, nevertheless, often run for shelter rather than remain safe, if uncomfortable, at sea, because they lack confidence in themselves and their boats.

When offshore swells run into shallower water along the beach, they build up steep waves because of resistance from the bottom. Natural inlets on sandy beaches, unprotected by breakwaters, usually build up a bar across the mouth. When the swells reach the bar, their form changes rapidly, and they become short, steep-sided waves that tend to break where the water is shallowest.

Consider this when approaching from offshore: A few miles off, the sea may be relatively smooth, and the inlet from seaward may not look as bad as it actually is. Breakers may run clear across the mouth, even in a buoyed channel.

Shoals shift so fast with moving sand that buoys do not always indicate the best water. Local boaters often leave the buoyed channel and are guided by the appearance of the sea, picking the best depth by the smoothest surface and absence of breakers. A stranger is handicapped here because he may not have knowledge of uncharted obstructions and so may not care to risk leaving the buoyed channel. He should thus have a local pilot, if possible, or he might lay off or anchor until he can follow a local boat in.

If you must get through without local help, these suggestions may make things more comfortable:

• Contact the local U.S. Coast Guard station, if there is one, for recommendations. In the absence of a Coast Guard unit, try to contact a local small-craft towing service, marina, or local fishing boats that frequently use the inlet.

• Make sure your boat is ready—close all hatches and ports, secure all loose gear, and get all persons into lifejackets, briefing them on what to do and what not to do.

• Don’t be in a hurry to run the inlet; wait outside the bar until you have had a chance to watch the action of waves as they pile up at the most critical spot in the channel, which will be the shallowest. Typically, waves will come along in groups of three, sometimes more. The last sea will be bigger than the rest, and by watching closely you can pick it out of the successive groups.

• When you are ready to enter, stand off until a big one has broken or spent its force on the bar, and then run through behind it. Watch the water both ahead and behind your boat; control your speed and match it to that of the waves.

An ebbing tidal current builds up a worse sea on the bars than the flood does because the rush of water out works against and under the incoming swells. If the sea looks too bad on the ebb, it is better to keep off a few hours until the flood has had a chance to begin. As deeper water helps, the very best time is the slack just before the tidal current turns to ebb. Do not use the times of high and low water to plan for the time of slack—these times are rarely, if ever, the same; see Chapter 17 for more on tides and currents.

Departing through inlets is less hazardous than entering, as the boat is on the safe side of the dangerous area and usually has the option of staying there. If you do decide to go out, you can spot dangerous areas more easily, and a boat heading into surf is more easily controlled than one running with the swells. The skipper of a boat outside an inlet may conclude that he has no other choice but to enter, but he should only attempt it in the safest possible manner.

### Heaving-To

When considerations get so bad offshore that a boat cannot make headway and begins to take too much punishment, it is time to heave-to, a maneuver whose execution varies for different vessels. Powerboats, both single- and twin-screw, will usually be most comfortable if brought around and kept bow to the seas or a few points (20 to 35°) off, using just enough power to make bare steerageway while conserving fuel; it may be necessary to occasionally use brief spurts of greater power to keep the craft headed in the best direction.

Sailboats traditionally heave-to with the wheel lashed to keep the boat headed up. A small, very strong storm jib is sheeted to windward to hold the bow just off the wind, while a storm trysail is sheeted flat. This is a small, strong triangular sail with a low clew and a single sheet; it should have a separate track on the mast so that it can be set up before the mainsail is dropped. A loose-footed sail, it is not traditionally bent to the boom, which is secured in its crutch or lashed down on deck. On a boat with a rigid hydraulic boom vang, however, the trysail can be clewed to the boom and controlled via the mainsheet and traveler. The jib-trysail combination balances the tendency of trysail and rudder to head the vessel into the wind against the effort of the backed jib to head it off, and the result is, ideally, that the boat lies 45° from the wind while making very slow headway.

A flat-cut trysail and a small, flat storm jib set from an inner forestay provide the best balance and ease of handling for heaving-to, but some sailboats will behave acceptably well when hove-to under a double- or triple-reefed mainsail and a heavy, roller-furled jib that’s mostly furled. A full-keeled sailboat will often come to a virtual stop when hove-to, drifting slowly, crabwise, at right angles to the wind. A fin-keeled boat may not heave-to quite as well but may still be far more docile hove-to than when trying to press ahead on a close reach or close-hauled.

A variation of heaving-to, called fore-reaching, is done under deeply reefed mainsail or trysail and a mere scrap of headsail or perhaps none at all. The idea is to jog along on a close reach, meeting the waves as advantageously as possible and maintaining just enough speed through each trough to surmount the oncoming crest.

#### Lying Ahull

If the wind and seas continue to build, there may come a point when heaving-to is no longer safe. Perhaps the wind is forcing the bow broadside to the waves despite the mainsail and hard-over rudder; perhaps the pressure of wind in sails is heeling the boat uncomfortably far over. It might be time to try lying ahull. All sail is dropped and secured, the helm is lashed to prevent damage to the rudder, and the vessel is left to find its own way. This tactic can afford the crew some much-needed rest on the open sea, but most boats will drift broadside to the seas when left unattended. Thus, when the wind is strong enough to raise breaking seas, it may be time to stop lying ahull and instead try lying to a sea anchor or—if there is ample sea room to leeward—running off before the storm, perhaps while trailing a drogue (see below).

### Sea Anchors

In extreme weather you may use a sea anchor, traditionally a heavy fabric cone with a hoop to keep it open at the mouth; it appears much like a megaphone. Its leading edge has a bridle of light lines leading to a fitting attached to a heavier towing line. The apex of the cone has a small, reinforced opening to allow a restricted amount of water to pass through from the wide end; see Figure 10-04. Sea anchors may also be a series of plastic floats that fold compactly for storage and are said to be more effective than the traditional kind. Newer designs borrow their general shape from aircraft parachutes. Some have lightweight canopies much like a parachute, while others use a lattice of webbing.

Figure 10-04 The towline of a traditional sea anchor is made fast to the eye in the bridle (upper right). A trip line is fastened to the apex of the cone; this end has a small opening to let some of the water flow through.

Sea anchors range in size from a few feet to 40 feet (1 to 12 m) or more in diameter depending upon the style of the sea anchor and the size and weight of the craft; they are more common on sailing craft than on powerboats. The bigger the diameter, the more effective a sea anchor will be. Whatever style of sea anchor you carry, test it in moderate weather a few times to make sure it is big enough to be effective. A small one may be easier to stow, but there’s no point to having it if it won’t do the job.

The line that attaches a sea anchor to the boat should be the same diameter as the rode for the craft’s conventional working anchor. A lightweight trip line attached to the smaller end allows the sea anchor to be pulled back to the boat, always an easier task than pulling the boat up to the sea anchor.

Improvised Sea Anchors In the absence of a regular sea anchor, try any form of drag rigged from spars, planks, canvas, or other material at hand that will float just below the surface and keep your boat from lying in the trough.

#### Using a Sea Anchor

The classic use of a sea anchor is to hold the bow of a boat to within a few points of the wind and waves as it drifts off to leeward when it is not making way through the water on its own power. A sea anchor is not meant to go to the bottom and hold, but merely to present a drag that keeps the boat’s head up; see Figure 10-05. A sea anchor will usually float just beneath the water’s surface. It should be streamed at least one wavelength away from the vessel, although the proper length may change with the circumstances. Chafing must be carefully guarded against; a short length of chain used where the rode comes on board is one solution. Such a sea anchor can reduce drift up to 90 percent, but that much reduction can cause the boat to take considerable punishment from wave action. Holding position, however, can save a vessel that has lost power off a lee shore (a shore to leeward of her). If engine repairs are possible, they are much more easily and quickly accomplished if the vessel is head to the seas rather than rolling in the trough. Another use is to allow a crew to rest after hours of battling a major storm at sea.

Figure 10-05 When using a parachute sea anchor, let out lots of rode, as this system relies heavily on the stretch of the nylon line for yielding to the seas (and not standing up against them). Even in moderate conditions, you should pay out at least 200 feet (60 m) of rode; use 10 to 15 times the length of the boat in heavy weather conditions.

When retrieving a sea anchor, motor very slowly up to the recovery float (refer to Figure 10-05), taking in the rode so as to not foul the craft’s propeller. Pick up the float and trip line with a boathook.

#### Drogues

A close relative of the sea anchor is the drogue, which is towed astern to keep a craft from yawing extremely or broaching, as mentioned on this page. A drogue may look something like a sea anchor, but with a larger vent opening to provide a lesser drag, because it is for use on a boat making way through the water. The Galerider drogue has a coarse web contruction to let seawater through, and the Jordan series drogue comprises dozens of small cones (the exact number depending on boat size) spaced along a rode to dampen accelerations down a wave face while yielding to overtaking waves. Unlike riding to a sea anchor, running before a storm while trailing a drogue is an active tactic, requiring someone at the helm. It also requires ample sea room to leeward, but monohull sailboats, especially those with fin keels, may do better running before a gale than riding to a sea anchor. A drogue must be secured ahead of the rudderpost in order to keep the boat maneuverable.

#### Cautions

Setting a sea anchor that is too small will allow the boat to drift backward at a too-rapid rate. This backward movement may result in damage to the rudder, especially on sailboats, or allow the boat to yaw and possibly fall off into a broach. One rule of thumb for sizing a cone-shaped sea anchor is to have the larger end one inch in diameter for each foot of the craft’s length at waterline (LWL). With parachute-type sea anchors, it is best to follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Whether streamed off the bow or stern, all types of sea anchors and drogues put a tremendous strain on a boat, which must be strongly built to withstand any waves that may pound on deck. Sailboats towing a drogue astern must have a watertight, self-draining cockpit with fast-draining scuppers. This prevents seawater from getting into the interior of the boat should it be pooped by a wave breaking over the stern and into the cockpit. Sport-fishing models of powerboats are not designed to survive being pooped, so towing a drogue astern of such craft cannot be recommended.

There is controversy over the safety and efficacy of sea anchors, especially in survival conditions offshore. Modern fin-keel sailboats may not lie quietly to a sea anchor off the bow without a small steadying sail. Such a sail may also keep a powerboat from “dancing” on its rode. Any boat that does not ride well to its anchor or mooring in harbor is unlikely to ride well to a sea anchor. Multihull sailboats seem to ride more successfully to a sea anchor than monohulls.

Sea anchors work only if there is sufficient sea room, because they do permit a steady drift to leeward. When a vessel is driven down onto a lee shore, it must use its regular ground tackle to ride out a gale. It is imperative that constant watch be kept to guard against dragging toward a lee shore. Use your engine to ease the strain during the worst of the blow, and give the anchor a long scope for its best chance to hold. Don’t confuse “lee shore”—a shore onto which the wind is blowing, a dangerous shore—with being “in the lee”—on the sheltered, safer side of an island or point of land.

#### Other Uses

Sea anchors can also prove useful in less stormy weather. A vessel that loses power in water too deep for conventional anchoring can drift many miles while waiting for assistance. Staying as close as possible to the location of the original distress call greatly assists rescuers; boats that drift from their reported position can be difficult to locate. By limiting drift, a sea anchor can keep a disabled boat in reasonable proximity to the location where rescuers will start their search.

Sport fishermen sometimes use a small sea anchor to slow their boat’s drift over schools of fish. Controlled drift is typically desired by fishermen, so a fishing sea anchor is smaller than one intended for use in an emergency. Commercial fishermen also use them as a means of “anchoring” at sea where depths do not permit normal anchoring; this is useful for resting between periods of fishing activity.

### Seamanship in “Thick” Weather

Another “adverse condition” that requires special skills is “thick” weather—conditions of reduced visibility caused by fog, heavy rain or snow, or haze. Fog is the most often encountered and severe of these.

Seamanship in thick weather is primarily a matter of avoiding collisions. Piloting and position determination, the legal requirements for sounding fog signals, and the meteorological aspects of fog are all covered elsewhere in this book (see Contents and Index). Here we will consider only the aspects of boat handling and safety.

#### Avoiding Collision

The primary needs of safety in conditions of reduced visibility are to see and be seen; to hear and be heard. The wise skipper takes every possible action to see or otherwise detect other boats and hazards, and simultaneously takes all steps to make his presence known to others.

#### Reduce Speed

You need, of course, to detect other vessels by sight, sound, or radar early enough to take proper action to avoid collision. Both the Inland and the International Navigation Rules require reduced speed for vessels in low visibility—a “safe speed appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions”; see this page.

It is best to be able to stop short in time rather than resort to violent evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision. The Navigation Rules require that, except where it has been determined that a risk of collision does not exist (by radar plot, perhaps), any vessel that hears another’s fog signal apparently forward of her beam must “reduce her speed to the minimum at which she can be kept on her course. She shall if necessary take all way off, and, in any event, navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over”; see this page.

#### Lookouts

Equally important with a reduction in speed is posting lookouts. This is a requirement of the Navigation Rules, but it is also common sense. Most modern motor- and sailboat designs place the helmsman aft, or fairly far aft, where he is not an effective lookout, so you will probably need one or two additional people on board as lookouts in thick weather.

#### Look…& Listen

Despite the “look” in “lookout,” such a person is there as much for listening as for seeing; see Figure 10-06. A person assigned as a lookout should have this duty as his sole responsibility while on watch. A skipper should certainly post a lookout as far forward as possible when in fog, and, if the helmsman is at inside controls, another lookout for the aft sector is desirable. Lookouts should be relieved as often as necessary to ensure their alertness; if the crew is small, an exchange of bow and stern duties will provide some change in position and relief from monotony. If there are enough people on board, a double lookout forward is not wasted manpower, but the two should take care not to distract each other.

Figure 10-06 Navigating in fog is one of the greatest tests of seamanship.

A bow lookout should keep alert for other vessels, listen for sound signals from aids to navigation, and watch for hazards like rocks and piles, breakers and buoys. Note that in thick weather, aids to navigation without audible signals can become hazards. A lookout aft should watch primarily for overtaking vessels, but he may also hear fog signals missed by his counterpart on the bow.

The transmission of sound in fog is uncertain and tricky. The sound may seem to come from directions other than the true source, and it may not be heard at all at otherwise normal ranges. See the discussion of fog signals in Chapters 5 and 14.

#### Stop Your Engine

When underway in fog in a boat under power, slow your engines to idle or shut them off entirely, at intervals, to listen for fog signals from other vessels and from aids to navigation. This is not a legal requirement of the Navigation Rules, but it is an excellent practice.

In these intervals, keep silence on the boat so you can hear even the faintest signal. The listening periods should be at least two minutes to conform with the legally required maximum intervals between the sounding of fog signals. Don’t forget to keep sounding your own signal during the listening period—you may get an answer from close by! Vary your timing to avoid being in sync with the signals of another vessel.

When proceeding in fog at a moderate speed, slow or stop your engines immediately any time your lookout indicates he has heard something. The lookout can then have the most favorable conditions for verifying and identifying what he believes he has heard.

#### Radar & Radar Reflectors

Radar has its greatest value in conditions of reduced visibility. If your craft has a radar, the Navigation Rules—both International and Inland—require that it be used. It must be on a long enough range scale as to give early warning of the possibility of collision, and all targets must be followed systematically. Use of radar, however, is not a substitute for adequate lookouts.

Whether or not you have radar, you should carry a passive radar reflector (see Chapter 16); this is the time to rig it and hoist it as high as possible. This increases the chances of your boat being detected sooner, and at a greater distance, by a radar-equipped vessel. (Your own radar will not make your craft easier to detect.)

#### Cruising with Other Boats

If you are cruising with other boats and fog closes in, you may be able to take advantage of a procedure used by wartime convoys. Tie onto the end of a long, light line some object that will float and make a wake as it moves through the water. A life ring or a glass or plastic bottle with a built-in handle will do quite well. The object is towed astern with the boats traveling in single file, one object behind each craft except the last; each bow lookout except the first can keep it in sight even though he cannot see the vessel ahead or even hear its fog signal.

#### Anchoring & Laying-to

If the weather, depth of water, and other conditions are favorable, consider anchoring rather than proceeding through conditions of poor visibility. Do not anchor in a heavily traveled channel or traffic lane, of course.

If you cannot anchor, then perhaps laying-to—being underway with little or no way on—may be safer than proceeding at even a much reduced speed.

Remember that different fog signals are required when you are underway, with or without way on, and when you are at anchor (see this page). By all means, sound the proper fog signal and keep your lookouts posted to look and listen for other craft and hazards.

#### Use Your Radio

In areas of heavy traffic, especially large vessels, some skippers of small fiberglass boats make “Securite” calls on VHF channels 16 and 13 to advise others of their presence.

## RUNNING AGROUND, ASSISTING & TOWING

It is an unwritten law of the sea that a boater should always try to render assistance to a vessel in need of aid. This is one of the primary functions of the Coast Guard, of course, but there are plenty of occasions when timely help by a fellow boater can save hours of effort later after the tide has fallen or wind and sea have had a chance to pick up.

Often, giving assistance means getting a towline to another skipper to get him out of a position of temporary embarrassment or perhaps to get him to a Coast Guard station or back to port. The situation can also be the other way around—you may go aground, or a balky motor or gear failure forces you to ask a tow from a passing boat.

In either case, you should know what to do and why. Thus the problems of running aground, and their solutions, will be considered from both viewpoints: being in need of assistance and being the one who renders aid to another vessel.

### Running Aground

Running aground is more often an inconvenience than a danger, and with a little know-how and some fast work, the period of stranding may be but a matter of minutes.

If grounding happens in a strange harbor, chances are you have been feeling your way along and so have just touched bottom lightly. You should be off again with little difficulty if your immediate actions do not put you aground more firmly.

If it becomes apparent that you are not going to get free quickly, or if the situation becomes serious because of weather, call the U.S. Coast Guard and report the incident. Unless your vessel or its crew is endangered, do not make this a “Mayday” call; simply call them and report the problem and your location—they will probably refer you to commercial assistance. If you accept commercial assistance, be sure to negotiate the terms (simple tow or salvage) and price in writing before any work takes place.

#### Right & Wrong Actions

The first instinctive act on going aground is to shift into reverse and advance the throttle in an effort to pull off; this may be the one thing that you should not do. You could damage the rudder or propeller; you might also pile up more of the bottom under the boat, making it harder aground. You may have already sucked mud or sand into the engine cooling system, or if not, you might do so. All of these events are highly undesirable.

First, check for any water coming in; if there is any, stopping the leak takes precedence over getting off. If no water is coming in, or when it has been stopped, and you are in tidal waters, immediately check the state of the tide. If the tide is rising and the sea quiet enough that the hull is not pounding, time is working for you, and whatever you do to assist yourself will be much more effective later than now. If you grounded on a falling tide, you must work quickly and do exactly the right things—or you will be fast for several hours or more.

About the only thing you know offhand about the grounding is the shape of your boat’s hull, its point of greatest draft, and thus the part most apt to be touching. If the hull tends to swing to the action of wind or waves, the point about which it pivots is the part grounded.

Check the water depth around the boat. Deeper water may be to one side rather than astern. You can use a lead line, boathook, or a similar item. Check from your deck all around. If you have a dinghy, use it to check over a wider area. Examine also the point where the water level meets your hull—if your normal waterline is well above the surface, you are more severely grounded than if there is no apparent change. Also check the raw water intake strainers to your engine or engines. Clean them out if clogged with sand, gravel, or mud before using engine power.

#### Cautions in Getting Off

Consider the type of bottom immediately. If it is sandy and you reverse hard, you may wash a quantity of sand from astern and throw it directly under the keel, bedding the boat down more firmly. Take care also not to suck up sand or mud into the engine through the engine’s raw water intake.

It the bottom is rocky and you insist on trying to reverse off, you may drag the hull and do more damage than with the original grounding.

Also, if grounded forward, remember that reversing a single-screw boat with a right-hand propeller may swing the stern to port and thus push the hull broadside onto adjacent rocks or into greater contact with a soft bottom.

#### Kedging after Grounding

The one right thing to do immediately after grounding is to take out an anchor in a dinghy, if available, and set it firmly, initiating the process of kedging your boat off a shoal; see Figure 10-07.

Figure 10-07 The first thing to do after going aground is to check hull integrity; next, get a kedge anchor out to keep from being driven farther aground. It may also provide a means of pulling free as waves or the wake from another craft lift your boat.

Unless your boat has been driven very hard aground, the everyday anchor should be heavy enough. Put the anchor and the line in the dinghy, make the bitter end fast to the grounded boat’s stern cleats, and power or row the dinghy out as far as possible, letting the line run from the stern of the dinghy as it uncoils. Whether rowed or powered with the outboard, taking the line out this way will make the dinghy much easier to control than if the anchor rode were dragged from the boat’s stern.

If you do not carry a dinghy, you can often swim out with an anchor, providing sea and weather conditions do not make it hazardous to go overboard. Use life preservers or buoyant cushions—one or two of either—to support the anchor out to where you wish to set it. Be sure to wear a life jacket or buoyant vest yourself, to save your energy for the work. And have a light line attached from you to the boat so that you can be pulled back if you become exhausted.

If there is no other way to get a kedge anchor out, you may consider throwing it out as far as possible. Although this is contrary to basic good anchoring practice, getting an anchor set is so important that it warrants the technique. You may need to throw several times before you get it set firmly.

When setting out the anchor, consider the sideways turning effects of a reversing single screw and, unless the boat has twin screws, set the anchor at a compensating angle from the stern. If the propeller is right-hand, set the anchor slightly to starboard of the stern. This will give two desirable effects. When pulling the anchor line while in reverse, the boat will tend to back in a straight line. When used alternately, first pulling on the line and then giving a short surge with the reverse, the resulting wiggling action of stern and keel can be a definite help in starting the boat moving.

With sailboats, it is often helpful to put out an anchor with a line running to or near the top of the mast. This can be used to heel the boat over, reducing its draft.

#### Getting Added Pulling Power

If you have a couple of double-sheave blocks and a length of suitable line on board, make up a simple watch tackle (often called a handy-billy) and fasten it to the anchor line. Then you can really pull! Such a tackle should be part of a boat’s regular equipment (see this page).

During the entire period of kedging the boat after grounding, keep the anchor line taut. The boat may yield suddenly to that continued pull, especially if a passing craft throws a wake that helps to lift the keel off the bottom.

Two kedges set out at an acute angle from either side of the stern and pulled upon alternately may give the stern a wiggle that will help you work clear.

If the bottom is sandy, that same pull with the propeller going ahead may wash some sand away from under the keel, with the desired result. If the anchor line is kept taut, try this maneuver with caution.

Move your crew and passengers quickly from side to side to roll the boat and make the keel work in the bottom. If you have spars, swing the booms outboard and put people on them to heave the boat down, thus raising the keel line. Shift ballast or heavy objects from over the portion grounded to lighten that section, and if you can, remove internal weight by loading it into the dinghy or by taking it ashore; pump excess water in your tanks overboard. Unloading a boat is especially practical when running aground at or near high tide—while the tide is going down and coming back up, you have time to unload the heaviest items in order to create more buoyancy.

#### When to Stay Aground

All of the above is based on the assumption that the boat is not holed. If it is holed, you may be far better off where it lies than you would be if it were in deep water again. If it is badly stove, you may want to take an anchor ashore to hold it on or pull it farther up until temporary repairs can be made.

As the tide falls, the damaged hull may be exposed far enough to allow some outside patching if you have something aboard to patch with. A piece of canvas, cushions, and bedding can all be used for temporary hull patches.

#### What to Do While Waiting

While waiting for the tide to rise, or for assistance to come, do not sit idle. Take soundings all around you. If circumstances permit, put on a mask and snorkel and take a look. A swing of the stern to starboard or port may do more for you than any amount of straight backward pulling; soundings will locate any additional depth—or, conversely, shallow areas or rocks.

If another boat is present, it may be able to help you even if it cannot pull. Have the other skipper run his boat back and forth to make as much wake as is safely possible. His wake may lift your boat just enough to permit you to back clear.

If your boat is going to be left high and dry with a falling tide, keep an eye on its layover condition. If there is anything to get a line to, even another anchor, you can make it lie over on whichever side you choose as it loses buoyancy. If the boat is deep and narrow, it may need some assistance in standing up again, particularly if it lies over in soft mud. Both the suction of the mud and the boat’s own deadweight will work against it; see Figure 10-08.

Figure 10-08 If you go aground on a falling tide, your boat may be left completely “high and dry.” If so, try to brace the boat so that it will stay as upright as possible; it will be easier to refloat.

If the hull is undamaged and you are left with a falling tide to sit out for a few hours, you might as well be philosophical about it—get over the side and make good use of the time. Undoubtedly you would prefer to do it under happier circumstances, but this may be an opportunity to make a good check of the bottom of your boat or to do any one of a number of little jobs that you could not do otherwise, short of a haul-out.

### Assisting a Stranded Boat

If you are not stranded but are able to help another boat that is, you must know what to do and what not to do.

The first rule of good seamanship in this case is to make sure your boat does not join the other craft in its trouble! Consider the draft of the stranded vessel relative to yours. Consider the size and weight of the grounded boat relative to the power of your engines—don’t tackle an impossible job; there are other ways of rendering assistance. Passing close by, making as large a wake as possible, may be all that is needed. Consider also your level of skill—it is often better not to try to be a hero. If you decide that you can safely and effectively assist, follow these guidelines. Otherwise, just stand by until the proper help arrives.

#### Getting a Line Over

It may seem easiest to bring a line in to a stranded boat by coming in under engine power, bow on, passing the line, and then backing out again, but do not try this until you are sure there is enough water for your boat. Make sure also that your boat backs well, without too much stern crabbing due to the action of the reversed propeller. Wind and current direction will greatly affect the success of this maneuver. If conditions tend to swing your boat broadside to the shallows as it backs, pass the line in some other manner.

Try backing in with wind or current compensating for the reversing propeller, keeping your boat straight and leaving its bow headed out. In any case, after the line is passed and made fast, do the actual pulling with your engines going ahead, to get full power into the pull. For better control over your boat, make the line fast as far forward of the stern as practical.

For safe control, you might drop your own bow anchor or anchors, and then send a line over from your boat to the stranded boat; see Figure 10-09. If a close approach seems unwise, anchor your own craft and then send the line in a dinghy, or buoy it and float it over.

Figure 10-09 Most recreational boats pull with the towline cleated astern, which restricts maneuverability. For safe control, put out a bow anchor and take up on its line as the stranded boat becomes free. This arrangement prevents the pulling boat from being carried into shoal water.

#### Making the Pull

If wind or current, or both, are broadside to the direction of the pull, keep your boat anchored even while pulling and keep a strain on your anchor line. Otherwise, as soon as your boat takes the pulling strain (particularly if the line is fast to its stern), you will have lost maneuverability, which could eventually put your boat aground broadside.

If you are pulling with your boat underway, secure the towline well forward of your stern so that, while hauling, your boat can angle into the wind and current and still hold its position; see Figure 10-10.

Figure 10-10 To aid in maneuverability, if a bow anchor cannot be set, make the towline fast to a cleat forward of the stern on the windward or up-current side of the pulling boat. Be sure that the cleat is capable of taking the heavy strain.

Tremendous strains can be set up, particularly on the stranded boat, by this sort of action, even to the point of carrying away whatever fitting the towline is made fast to. Ordinary recreational craft are not designed as tugboats; the cleats or bitts available for making the line fast may well not be strong enough for such a strain, and they are probably not located advantageously for such work. It is far better to run a bridle around the whole hull and pull against this bridle than to risk damaging some part of the stern by such straining. Use a bridle on your boat, too, if there is any doubt of its ability to withstand such concentrated loads; see Figure 10-11.

Figure 10-11 The best procedure is to put a bridle around the hull or superstructure of both boats in order to distribute the strain over as wide an area as possible. Be sure to pad pressure points to guard against chafing or scarring.

When operating in limited areas, the stranded craft should have an anchor out for control when it comes off. It should also have another anchor ready to be put over the side, if necessary, to keep it from going back aground if it is without power. Through all of this maneuvering, keep all lines clear of propellers and make sure no sudden surge is put on a slack line.

### Towing

At some time you will probably need to take another vessel in tow. In good weather with no sea running, the problem is fairly easy. It involves little more than maneuvering your boat into position forward of the other boat, and passing it a towline. (Note that the adage about whose towline is used in determining liability in case of an accident is not true.)

Generally speaking, the towing boat should pass her towline to the other craft. You may want to send over a light line first (a plastic waterski towline that floats is excellent), and use that to haul over the actual towing line.

When approaching a boat that is dead in the water to pass it a line, do not be dramatic and move in too close if there is any kind of sea running. Just buoy a long line with several life preservers, tow it astern, and take a turn about the stern of the disabled vessel, but don’t foul its propeller in doing so. The crew of the vessel being assisted can pick the line up with a boathook from the cockpit with far less fuss than by any heave-and-catch method, as long as you are to windward.

The most logical place to attach the line on the boat to be towed is that boat’s forward bitt or cleats, but be sure that such fitting can take the load. The bitt or cleat should be fastened with through bolts of adequate diameter, washers, and nuts—never with self-tapping screws. If the fastening is to the deck, it should be reinforced on the underside with a hardwood or metal backing plate of sufficient area. Even better is a bitt fastened to a major structural member. Be cautious; if an item of deck hardware pulls out under heavy load, the stretched towline can act as a slingshot, hurling the bitt or cleat with great force, enough to cause serious injury or death.

A trailerable boat will have a bow eye that makes an excellent place for attaching a towline; if it is a cast-type bow eye, it could snap off from an improper alignment of the pull. On a small sailboat with the mast going through the deck, wrap the towline around the mast; if the mast is stepped on deck, do not fasten to it—you will only pull it off.

##### TOWING PRINCIPLES

Start off easy! Don’t try to dig up the whole ocean, and merely end up with a lot of cavitation and vibration. A steady pull at a reasonable speed will get you to your destination with far less strain on boats, lines, and crewmembers.

• When towing, keep the two boats “in step” by adjusting the towline length to keep both on the crest or in the trough of seas at the same time. Sometimes, as with a confused sea, this may not be possible, but the idea is to prevent a situation where the boat being towed is shouldering up against the back of one sea, presenting maximum resistance, while the towing boat is trying to run down the forward slope of another sea. Then when this condition is reversed, the tow alternately runs ahead briefly and then surges back on the towline with a heavy strain. If there is any degree of uniformity to the waves, the strain on the towline will be minimized by adjusting it to the proper length.

• As the tow gets into protected, quiet waters, shorten up on the line to allow better handling in close quarters. Swing as wide as possible around buoys and channel turns so that the tow has room to follow.

• A small boat in tow should be trimmed a little by the stern; trimming by the head causes her to yaw. In a seaway this condition is aggravated, and it is increasingly important to keep the bow relatively light.

• It is easy for a larger boat to tow a smaller vessel too fast, causing it to yaw and capsize. Always tow at a moderate speed, something less than your hull speed (in knots, 1.34 times the square root of the waterline length in feet), and make full allowance for adverse conditions of wind and waves.

• In smooth water, towing boats may borrow an idea from tugs, which often take their tow alongside in harbor or sheltered waters for better maneuverability. The towing boat should make fast on the other craft’s quarter; refer to Figure 10-12.

• In relatively calm water, even a dinghy with a small outboard motor can tow a medium-size boat at slow speed, enough to get it into harbor or to a pier; tow astern or alongside as required for maneuverability.

###### TOWING ALONGSIDE

• Towing alongside may be necessary when the towed craft has lost its steering capability, or when only one person is on board the disabled boat and is using its dinghy to tow. Towing alongside is better than towing astern in congested areas, where maneuvering is more critical.

#### Towing Lines

Three-strand twisted nylon has excessive stretch and dangerous snap-back action if parted under load; it should not be used if its use can be avoided.

Polypropylene line floats and is a highly visible bright yellow, but it has little elasticity, and shock loads are heavily transferred to fittings on both the towed and towing craft. Further, it has less strength (requiring larger sizes), and is stiff, making it difficult to stow and handle; it is also particularly subject to chafing damage. With all these disadvantages, this line, in sizes up to ½ inch, is suitable only for light towing loads in protected waters.

The preferred line for towing is double-braided (braid-on-braid) nylon. It has sufficient elasticity to cushion shock loads, but also creates a lesser snap-back hazard. This line is stronger than three-strand twisted nylon of the same size and will not kink. Its disadvantage is that it does not float and must be watched to avoid entanglement in the towing vessel’s propeller. It is the most expensive type of line, but for moderate- and heavy-duty towing it is well worth the cost.

#### Handling the Towing Boat

The worst possible place to make a towline fast is to the stern of the towing boat, because the pull of the tow prevents the stern from swinging properly in response to rudder action, limiting the boat’s maneuverability. The towline should be made fast as far forward as practicable, as in tug and towboat practice. The deck hardware of the towing boat must be capable of carrying the load—the same as described above for the towed craft. If there is no suitable place forward, make a bridle from the forward bitts, running around the superstructure to a point in the forward part of the cockpit. Such a bridle will have to be wrapped with chafing gear wherever it bears on the superstructure or any corners, and even then it may cause some chafing of the finish.

#### Cautions in Towing

Secure the towline so that it can be cast loose if necessary, or, failing that, have a knife or hatchet ready to cut it. This line is a potential danger to anyone nearby if it should break and come whipping forward. Three-strand nylon acts like a huge rubber band when it breaks, and there have been some bad accidents. Never stand near or in line with a highly stressed towline, and keep a wary eye out at all times.

On board the towed boat, have an anchor ready to drop in case the towline breaks or must be cast off.

If for any reason you must come near a burning vessel to tow it (for instance, to prevent it from endangering other boats or property), approach from windward so the flames are blowing away from you. Your lightest anchor with its length of chain thrown into the cockpit or through a window of the burning boat could act as a good grappling hook.

When the towing boat is smaller than the towed craft, it will often encounter heavy resistance from waves hitting the larger vessel; these waves can slow or even stop the progress of the tow. Crosswinds may make you drift off course faster than you are prepared for. One way to avoid these problems is for the towing boat to make fast alongside the towed craft near its quarter; see Figure 10-12. This will make the towing more efficient—even a dinghy with an average outboard motor can usually tow a much larger craft in this manner.

Figure 10-12 Spring lines are used as shown above when a boat takes a larger craft in tow alongside. Fenders are used at points of contact, and springs are made up with no slack. Both boats respond as a unit to the towing boat’s rudder action.

In any towing situation, never have people fend off the other vessel with hands or feet; even the smallest boats coming together under these conditions can cause broken bones or severed fingers. With large vessels, the risk is the loss of a whole limb, or worse.

Never allow anyone to hold a towing line while towing another vessel, regardless of its size. They could receive badly torn tendons and muscles, they might lose the towline over the side, or they could be dragged overboard.

#### When Not to Tow

Towing can be a dangerous undertaking, as well as an expensive one, if not properly done. If you are not equipped for the job, stand by the disabled vessel. If your craft’s engine would be barely adequate for the task, as in the case of a small sailboat with a small inboard or outboard auxiliary engine, towing another boat in less than perfect conditions might be awkward. You may be able to put a line across and assist by keeping the other craft’s bow at a proper angle to the sea until help comes.

Call the U.S. Coast Guard or other towing agency, and turn the job over to them when they arrive. Don’t try to be a hero, as you are more than likely neither trained nor experienced in this type of work. Remember that the most important concern of a skipper is the safety of persons on board, not the safety of the craft itself. No boat is worth a life! Never tow a vessel that is taking on water. If possible, dewater it and patch the leak. Otherwise, rescue the people on board.

## TRANSFERRING PEOPLE FROM ONE BOAT TO ANOTHER

When it becomes necessary to transfer a person from one boat to another, special seamanship techniques must be employed. The relative size of the craft involved will be a major consideration; transfers at the same height above the water are much easier and safer than when a person must step up or down. The roughness of the water from swells or waves or wakes will also be a major factor. A transfer of personnel must not be attempted unless all factors are favorable. The desire of persons to transfer must not be allowed to result in an unsafe action. When a rescue boat is loaded to capacity, additional help must be called.

Approaches bow-to-bow, beam-to-beam, and stern-to-stern are all possibilities to be considered. Many times, the stern-to-stern technique is desirable if the water is calm enough, particularly if both craft have swim platforms. An additional person should be on each platform to assist the transferee; all of them should be wearing PFDs. The actual transfer should be by stepping rather than jumping; at this time, the engines of both boats should be in neutral. Bow-to-bow and beam-to-beam crossovers are subject to the same general procedures and requirements as above.

It is of the utmost importance that the skippers of the two boats come to full agreement, preferably by radio before the boats come close to each other, as to who does what and when. It is preferable that one craft remain essentially stationary and the other does all the maneuvering. The transfer should not be rushed—if the conditions are not suitable, wait; if an attempt goes bad, back off and try again.

SAFETY AFLOAT

Duties & Responsibilities of the Skipper • Basic Operating Procedures Safety Organizations • Construction for Safety • Engines & Fuel Systems Electrical Systems • Lightning Protection • Equipment for Safety Maintenance for Safety • Safety in the Water • First Aid Afloat

Although boating is not an inherently unsafe activity, there are many actions that can make it safer and more carefree without spoiling its enjoyment. Good seamanship begins with knowledge and use of safe practices in all aspects of boating. For the skipper, this includes knowing his duties and responsibilities, as well as having an understanding of the construction of boats, their equipment, operation, and maintenance. While not allowing it to detract from his enjoyment of boating, the wise operator practices safety at all times while afloat and studies it frequently ashore. He recognizes the importance of safety, and it is always in the back of his mind. He views safety not as an arbitrary set of rules, but as the practical application of special knowledge and common sense.

Most boating accidents and difficulties arise from ignorance and could have been avoided. A person does not knowingly put his life, the lives of others, and the safety of valuable property in jeopardy, but he may do so through lack of knowledge.

## DUTIES & RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE SKIPPER

As the skipper you are responsible for the safety of your boat and the people on board. You are also responsible for the safety of nearby craft and the people on them, for swimmers and water-skiers in your vicinity, and anyone else who might be affected by your boat’s course or wake. This applies to all sizes of boats on all waters and at all times. One of the challenges of boating is accepting this responsibility without letting it detract from your enjoyment of boating.

### Leadership

Leadership and discipline are subjects rarely considered by recreational boaters, but they are valuable assets, particularly should an emergency occur.

Discipline means prompt and cheerful obedience to laws and regulations designed primarily for safety. It also means a square deal to shipmates; the skipper who expects discipline of his crew must likewise discipline himself.

Discipline does not mean a long string of commands with a crew constantly scurrying about the deck. There can be discipline on board the smallest craft without there being any apparent show of it. Real discipline is a function of leadership, and leadership can be exercised in casual clothing on any boat. If you establish your authority as the leader and delegate with tact, each outing on your boat can be both fun and safe.

Leadership is based on three things: (1) each skipper must know himself, his abilities, and his limitations; (2) he must know his job, know it so well that he doesn’t have to think about the details of doing it; (3) he must know his crew and his boat and what he can reasonably expect of them in an emergency.

### Foresight

Next to leadership comes forehandedness or foresightedness. A first-class skipper doesn’t wait for an emergency to arise; he has already formulated solutions to any emergency he may face. “Plan ahead” is one of the best pieces of advice you can be given in boating.

Even the most experienced skipper will admit that he has at times been fooled by unexpected effects of wind or current or by engine failure. Dangerous situations can develop with great suddenness—so even when all looks well, watch out! You should have an answer to every threat and a plan to take you out of every danger.

### Vigilance

Next in importance is vigilance. As skipper, you must be constantly alert to everything you can see and hear, outside and inside the boat. And your vigilance must extend beyond this to foreseeing situations as well. An aircraft pilot’s rule that he must be able to get into alternate fields as well as the airport of his destination holds comparable meaning for the boat skipper, too.

You must be able to concentrate—distractions such as loud music or rowdy passengers must not be allowed to divert your attention from your important tasks. Maintain a safety consciousness at all times.

### Common Sense

One more checkpoint: common sense. The successful skipper has a sense of proportion and of the fitness of things. We can all recall cases where through lack of common sense, we did things that later looked rather ridiculous. Use your head!

#### Check of Equipment

Before you get any boat underway, check to see if it is really ready to go. Not only should all equipment required by law (Chapters 2 and 3) be on board and in proper condition for use, but all navigational and other equipment should be at hand. Check water and fuel tanks, inspect ground tackle, check stores, and complete all those other small jobs that can be done easily at the mooring or safe in a slip, but not underway or in an emergency.

Prepare a “predeparture checklist” (see this page) and keep it updated. Don’t trust to memory or routine to ensure that everything necessary is on board—have a list and use it.

#### Physical Condition of the Skipper

Also relevant to a boat’s safe operation is the physical condition of its skipper. The constant vigilance that is necessary requires his complete possession of his faculties and a sense of physical well-being. The skipper’s readiness and ability to deal effectively with sudden danger and emergencies depends on his being in good physical and mental condition.

Although partaking of alcoholic beverages is commonly a part of boating activities, the prudent skipper abstains while underway or when getting underway is anticipated in the next few hours. Alcohol adversely affects memory, balance, night vision, and muscular coordination; tests have shown that effects of sun and wind encountered in boating tend to aggravate these effects. Think before you drink—especially when boating.

#### Avoiding Risk

Do not permit any of your crew or guests to take needless risks. Anyone doing a job that involves danger of being swept overboard must wear a life jacket and be securely tethered to the boat.

Carefully observe the current weather and check the forecast before getting underway. If the weather doesn’t look good, stay in port until conditions improve. A day on the water is not worth the risk of your boat or a life.

#### Acting Moderately

A major part of common sense is acting moderately. Make all changes of course and speed with moderation. Don’t accelerate from a stop or slow speed so abruptly as to possibly cause other persons on board discomfort or injury. Full-throttle starts are unnecessary, except perhaps for getting a waterskier up and going. Likewise, don’t make sudden and abrupt changes in heading unless necessary.

If appropriate, as it will be in many cases, make an announcement or warning of what you are about to do. A simple “Here we go” or “Hold tight” will do much to avoid a preventable accident.

#### Maintaining a Lookout

A small craft cannot readily use the lookout routine of a large vessel, but the vigilance and caution of that routine should be acknowledged. Having a lookout is not only a requirement of the Navigation Rules, it is good common sense. As skipper, make it a matter of pride to always be first to spot, analyze, and react effectively to any threatening event. On the water, a dangerous situation can develop with amazing speed; you should try to be “one step ahead” of any developing hazard.

### Specific Responsibilities

The responsibilities of the skipper or of the individual on watch are as follows:

• Safe navigation of the boat.

• Safe and efficient handling of the boat in the presence of other boats.

• Safety of personnel and material on board.

• Rendering assistance to all in danger or distress.

• Smart handling and smart appearance of the boat.

• Comfort and contentment on board.

• A good log.

### The Crew

Recreational boating is usually a family affair—indeed, one of its most pleasing aspects is that essentially the whole family can share in activities.

One aspect of boating that should not be overlooked is the training of the crew. No boat of any appreciable size should depart its slip or mooring for an afternoon’s run or a cruise measured in days without an adequately trained crew, especially an alternate for the skipper. At least one other person should be fully competent to take the helm under all normal conditions of wind and waves, and really should be able to do so under adverse weather conditions. He, she, or they should be capable of bringing the boat alongside a pier and of anchoring it. A sudden incapacitating illness or accident to the skipper may thrust heavy responsibilities upon the alternate without warning. If that person has been trained ahead of time, the emergency will be significantly less drastic and much more easily handled.

#### Training the Crew

A training program need be neither onerous nor unpleasant; in fact, it need not even be apparent to the “students”! It should, however, be planned and carried out on a formal basis so that the skipper can be sure that everyone knows what he has to know. The secret to a successful family crew-training program is to make it fun and not let it take the pleasure out of boating.

With just a little imagination, a man-overboard drill can be made into a game without losing one bit of its effectiveness. With patience and adequate opportunities for practice, the mate and older children can be developed into skillful helmsmen. Every member of the crew should know where the fire extinguishers are and should have had actual experience in using them; see Figure 11-02. It is well worth the small price of recharging one or two extinguishers to gain the experience of putting out a fire with one. (By the way, have you ever actually put out a fire with an extinguisher of the type now on your boat?) This practice should not, of course, be carried out on the boat, but it is easily done ashore.

The mate, at least, and preferably several others of the crew, should know how to turn the radio on, select and change channels, and how to send a call for emergency assistance, a Mayday call.

Figure 11-02 It is not enough that approved-type fire extinguishers be on board at appropriate locations; before getting underway, every member of the crew should be trained in how they are used.

#### Instruction Plus Practice

A proper training program consists of instruction plus practice. First, learn for yourself what should be done and how, and then pass this information on to your crew. For routine matters such as boat handling, give each crewmember the chance to become proficient—it may be quicker and easier on your nerves always to bring the boat alongside a pier yourself, but you should have the patience to let others learn how by doing. For emergency procedures, have both planned and unannounced drills.

All aboard, including you, should be trained to do the right thing instinctively and quickly in a real emergency. A useful resource is the Coast Guard’s free safe-boating app for mobile devices, which can be downloaded at www.uscgboating.org/mobile.

#### Guests on Board

When you have guests on board, they may or may not become part of the crew. If qualified, give them some clearly defined job(s) to do—and be sure to tell the regular crewmembers who normally perform those duties to supervise or stand aside as appropriate.

If your guests have had little or no boating experience, take them on a tour of the boat. Without overdoing it and frightening them, point out possible dangers such as cleats on the deck that might be a cause of tripping, the hazards of riding on the bow, the boom of a sailboat—you know the possibilities on your boat, point them out to your guests. Show them the location of PFDs, and how to put them on; show them the location of the fire extinguishers, and how to operate them. Tell them what they can do to help with the operation of the boat, and even more importantly, what they should not attempt to do.

### Important Actions Underway

Here is a short checklist of things to do and not do:

• Check and plot the boat’s position frequently when in sight of land or aids to navigation; be certain of the identification of the objects used to fix position.

• Keep a close eye on the depth sounder. If your boat has one, set the minimum depth alarm to a suitable depth. Don’t be caught by surprise by shallow water.

• Note the effect of wind and current on the boat, especially in close waters or when maneuvering near other boats.

• Do not follow other boats blindly; steer a safe course, and do not assume that another craft is on a safe course.

• When in doubt about your position, slow down; do not wait until the last minute.

• Remember that the other skipper may not see you, and always be alert to take immediate steps to prevent a collision.

## BASIC OPERATING PROCEDURES

There are a number of basic operating procedures that are done repeatedly in everyday boating. After doing them routinely time after time, there is a tendency to do them semiautomatically, perhaps cutting corners and slighting some steps—that is simply human nature. Periodically, take time to stop and think; refresh your mind and perform each step properly one by one. Being fully safe requires constant attention to detail.

### Fueling

Fueling a boat properly is an essential element of good seamanship. Before starting out make sure that you have enough fuel on board, and if any is needed, put it in safely. Certain precautions must be carefully and completely observed every time that a boat is fueled with gasoline. (Diesel fuel is nonexplosive, but it will burn; when putting diesel in your boat’s tanks, use all appropriate precautions.)

#### Before Fueling

1. Make sure your boat is properly secured to the fueling pier. Fuel before dark if possible.

2. Stop engines, motors, fans, and other devices that could produce a spark. Turn off the master switch for the batteries if the electrical system has one. Put out all galley fires and open flames.

3. Close all ports, windows, doors, and hatches so that fumes cannot blow aboard and below.

4. Disembark all passengers and any crewmembers not needed for the fueling operation.

5. Prohibit all smoking on board and nearby.

6. Have an approved, well-maintained fire extinguisher close at hand.

7. Measure the fuel in the tanks and do not plan to put in more than the tank will hold; allow for expansion.

#### While Fueling

8. Keep nozzle or can spout in contact with the opening to guard against static sparks.

9. Do not spill any fuel, especially gasoline.

10. Do not overfill. Filling a tank until fuel flows from the vents is dangerous.

11. For boats with outboard motors, remove any portable tanks from the boat and fill on shore.

#### After Fueling

12. Close fill openings.

13. Wipe up any spilled fuel; dispose of wipe-up rags on shore.

14. Open all ports, windows, doors, and hatches; turn on bilge blower. Ventilate boat at least four minutes.

15. Sniff low down in tank and engine compartments. If odor of gasoline is present, do not start engine; continue ventilation actions until odor can no longer be detected. Check for any drips and liquid fuel.

16. Be prepared to cast off lines as soon as engine starts; get clear of the fueling station promptly.

### Loading

Overloading is a major cause of accidents and deaths in all types of smaller boats and dinghies, and also has significance for medium-size boats; see Figure 11-03. Overloading is particularly hazardous because people do not fear it as they do fires and explosions. Many a skipper, cautious in his handling of gasoline and other safety matters, will unthinkingly load his craft far beyond safe limits. The number of seats in a boat is not an indication of the number of persons it can carry safely.

Figure 11-03 Overloading is a major cause of boating accidents and can worsen the outcome of any mishap while underway. Be sure to check your craft’s capacity plate before loading.

#### Determining Capacity

“Loading” and “capacity” are terms primarily related to the weight of persons, fuel, and gear that can be safely carried. The safe load of a boat in persons depends on many of its characteristics, among them hull volume and dimensions; what it is made of; for outboards, whether there is an effective engine well inboard of the transom notch where the engine is mounted; and how heavy the engine is.

USCG Capacity Plates Boats under 20 feet in length (6.1 m)—inboard, outboard, and sterndrive, other than sailboats and certain special types—must carry a capacity plate specified by U.S. Coast Guard regulations issued under the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971. These capacities are computed from rather complex formulas. Plates on craft powered by one or more outboard motors show the maximum weight for persons; the maximum number of persons; and the total maximum weight for motor, fuel, gear, and persons. These plates also show the maximum horsepower capacity, or the total horsepower if more than one engine is mounted; see Figure 11-04. Plates for inboard and sterndrive craft show only the maximum passenger capacity in terms of weight and number of persons, and the maximum weight for fuel, gear, and persons; see Figure 11-05. Your boat’s capacity plate must be mounted where you can see it when you are preparing to get underway.

Limits on capacity plates apply for boating in good to moderate weather conditions. In rough waters keep the weight well below the limit. The presence of a capacity plate does not relieve you of responsibility for sound judgment. You should know probable future weather conditions as well as those prevailing when starting out.

Figure 11-04 The capacity plate on an outboard boat shows the limits of loading in terms of number of persons; the maximum weight of persons; and the total weight of motor, fuel, gear, and persons. A maximum horsepower rating is also shown.

Figure 11-05 A capacity plate for a boat with an inboard engine or a sterndrive shows only the maximum allowable number and weight of persons, and the maximum weight for persons and gear. Exceeding these numbers or weights is not a violation of federal law but may be considered in case of accidents.

#### Safe Loading

Remember that people represent a “live” load; they move about and affect a boat quite differently than static loads like the engine or fuel tank. If your boat’s capacity is fully utilized or the weather gets rough, distribute the load evenly, keep it low, and don’t make abrupt changes in its distribution. Make any shift in human or other weights only after stopping or slowing.

#### Horsepower Capacity

A second aspect of capacity for smaller craft is the maximum horsepower motor that it can safely carry; this capacity is exceeded perhaps as often as the weight-carrying one.

You need not use the maximum safe horsepower; most boats give satisfactory and more economical service with motors of lesser horsepower. A larger engine does not always mean more speed; it does mean that the increased weight of the engine and of its fuel and accessories will significantly reduce the number of people that can be safely carried.

#### Boarding a Small Boat

There is a safe way to step aboard a small boat—outboard or dinghy—and an unsafe way; see Figure 11-06. In boarding from a pier or a larger boat, step into the boat as near to the center as possible, keeping body weight low. If you’re boarding from a beach, come in over the bow. Keep lines tight or have someone steady the boat.

Figure 11-06 Do not attempt to step aboard a dinghy—even a stable inflatable like this—carrying heavy or bulky items. Instead, hand them across as shown. If alone, line up the items on the pier, step aboard, and then reach over for the gear or packages.

Never jump into a boat or step on the gunwale (edge of the hull). If you must take a motor or other gear aboard, place it on the edge of the pier where you can easily reach it from the center of the boat. Better yet, after you are in the boat, have someone on the pier hand it to you.

If stepping into a canoe or light dinghy on a beach, remember that the unsupported parts of a hull out of the water are quite vulnerable. A rock could be driven through the hull as your entire weight is applied on one foot.

The boarding cautions above are primarily focused on a “hard” dinghy. An inflatable, with its buoyancy tubes at each side, is more stable, but care should still be taken.

### Predeparture Actions

Another measure of good seamanship is the procedure you follow before departure.

If you will be gone overnight or longer, you should repeat many of these steps each day before getting underway.

#### Final Weather Check

No boat or ship is large enough to justify the skipper’s ignoring forecast weather conditions. You should make a final weather check close to departure time. Know the time of best weather broadcasts, radio and TV (including cable), in your home area (these broadcasts vary widely in their scope and suitability for boating); know the telephone numbers of agencies to call for last-minute information. When away from your home waters, find on arrival at each overnight stop how you can get early-morning forecasts before departure.

The Marine Weather Services Charts published each year by the National Weather Service (see Chapter 24, this page and this page) give information on major radio and TV weather broadcasts as well as the locations of regional Weather Service broadcast antennas. NWS is also steadily expanding the number of VHF-FM radio transmitters that broadcast continuous weather information; also available on the Web at www.weather.gov/nwr; see also Chapter 24.

#### Predeparture Checklist

Prepare your own predeparture checklist and use it. Review and revise the list if you change boats or boating areas.

The following items apply generally; you may not need them all, and you may add some of your own. Check that:

• All safety equipment is aboard, accessible, and in good working condition, including one Coast Guard–approved PFD for each person.

• The bilge has no fuel fumes and little or no water. Ventilate or pump out as necessary. (On a gasoline-powered inboard-engine craft, operate the blower for at least four minutes, then sniff the bilge for any fumes.)

• All navigation lights operate satisfactorily (even if you do not intend to be out after sunset); horn works properly.

• All loose gear is stowed securely. Dock lines and fenders should be stowed immediately after getting underway.

• Engine and transmission oil levels are adequate, and coolant level is sufficient in closed cooling systems. After starting engines, check overboard flow of cooling water.

• Fuel tanks are as full as you need and compartments have been properly ventilated; see Figure 11-07. Know your tank capacity and fuel consumption at various rpms, and the cruising radius this gives. Make sure there is enough fuel aboard for your anticipated cruising, plus an adequate reserve if you must change your plans for weather or other reasons. For a day’s outing and return home, follow the “rule of thirds”—one third for the trip outbound, one third for the return run, and one third for reserve.

Figure 11-07 A warning label is required near an ignition switch on a boat in order to comply with the powered ventilation requirements of the Coast Guard. Help prevent disaster by posting a warning label in any unventilated compartment into which a crewmember might place gasoline or a cleaning solvent container.

• All guests have been properly instructed in safety and operational matters—both dos and don’ts.

• There is at least one other person on board capable of taking over for you if you are disabled.

#### Float Plan

Before departing, tell a responsible relative or friend where you intend to cruise and when you expect to make port again; make sure he or she has a good description of the boat. (Do not attempt to file this “Float Plan” with the U.S. Coast Guard; they do not have the manpower to keep track of boats as the FAA monitors aircraft flights.) After departure, tell that person of any changes in your cruise plans, so he can tell the Coast Guard where to search and what type of boat to look for if you are overdue. And be sure to check in with him or her when you return to prevent false alarms about your safety.

Forms are not required for float plans, but they do make it easier to record the necessary information and ensure against omissions; see sidebar above. The Coast Guard offers a useful float plan form that can be accessed from the Coast Guard website at www.uscgboating.org; similar formats are in many books and periodicals. Forms are also available from many marine insurance offices.

## SAFETY ORGANIZATIONS

There are many public and private organizations devoted to the promotion of boating safety. Several teach boating safety; others are concerned with the material and operational aspects of boats and boating.

#### Educational Organizations

United States Power Squadrons The USPS is a volunteer organization of more than 20,000 members organized into over 300 local squadrons. These units, located throughout the United States and in some overseas areas, offer educational programs of basic safety and piloting to the public, and more advanced courses to members; see Figure 11-08.

Figure 11-08 The United States Power Squadrons is an organization of volunteers dedicated to making boating safer through education. Boats skippered by a USPS member are usually identified by the distinctive flag with blue-and-white vertical stripes, shown here.

It is a nonprofit, self-sustaining private membership organization dedicated to teaching better and safer boating. Despite the word “Power” in its name, the USPS includes many sailboat skippers in its ranks. USPS also has several public service programs, including the reporting of chart corrections and the Vessel Safety Check (VSC) program (see this page). The boats of members can be identified by the USPS Ensign with its blue-and-white vertical stripes.

Many thousands of boaters and families receive instruction in the USPS Boating Course every year. For information on local and online classes, go to www.usps.org.

The Canadian Power and Sail Squadrons are organized similarly to the USPS, with modifications to fit Canada’s laws and customs.

United States Coast Guard Auxiliary The USCGAux is a voluntary civilian organization of owners of boats, private airplanes, and shore radio stations; it is a nonmilitary group, although administered by the U.S. Coast Guard. It promotes safety in operation of small boats through education, boat safety checks, and operational activities.

The Auxiliary carries on a program of public boating courses free of charge except for the cost of materials. Members take specialty courses to increase their knowledge and abilities. The Auxiliary’s 26,000 members are organized into 825 flotillas around the country.

Vessel Safety Check (formerly known as Courtesy Marine Examination) is a well-known program of both the Coast Guard Auxiliary and the United States Power Squadrons. Specially trained USCGAux and USPS members conduct annual checks on boats, but only with the consent of the owner; see Figure 11-09 and this page. Boats that meet a strict set of requirements are awarded a distinguishing decal. If a boat fails to qualify, the owner is urged to remedy any defects and request a reexamination. No report of failure is made to any authority.

Figure 11-09 Boat owners can request the free Vessel Safety Check given by members of the Coast Guard Auxiliary, shown here, or by USPS members. Craft that meet all the requirements are awarded a decal for the current year.

The Auxiliary promotes safety afloat by assisting the Coast Guard in patrolling regattas and racing events. In many areas, the Auxiliary also participates in search-and-rescue for vessels that are disabled, in distress, or have been reported overdue.

Information on public classes of the Auxiliary or membership in the organization may be obtained from a local flotilla or by going to the Auxiliary website, www.cgaux.org.

American National Red Cross The Red Cross offers programs of water safety education through its more than 3,000 local chapters in all areas of the United States; see Figure 11-10. The swimming and water safety skills taught by the Red Cross range from beginning through advanced swimmer, survival swimming, and lifesaving.

Figure 11-10 Local chapters of the American Red Cross teach swimming, life saving, and other water safety subjects, including first aid and CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation), to persons of all ages. Every person who goes boating should try to become an adequate swimmer.

Red Cross first-aid training is also available to the public through local chapters. A wise skipper would do well to learn the proper action to be taken in common emergencies. Training in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is desirable for all skippers, but it is essential for those cruising off-shore; it is now a requirement for USCG licenses.

Textbooks used in Red Cross training programs may be purchased from larger bookstores or through local chapters; all are valuable reference publications. Available texts from the Red Cross include Swimming and Water Safety, Lifesaving and Water Safety, and First Aid; all are reasonably priced.

The Red Cross publishes a variety of safety pamphlets and posters and produces informational and instructional films. These are available free to interested groups. Information on classes, publications, films, and other safety activities can be obtained from local chapters. and at www.redcross.org.

#### Boat & Equipment Organizations

In addition to the national volunteer groups working toward greater safety afloat through education, there are several organizations related to the boating industry that promote safety through standards for boats and equipment, including installation and use.

American Boat & Yacht Council, Inc. The ABYC is a nonprofit public-service organization founded in 1954 to “improve and promote the design, construction, equipage, and maintenance of small craft with reference to safety.” Membership is open to companies and individuals.

The American Boat & Yacht Council develops and publishes “Safety Standards,” which are recommended specifications and practices for making small craft as free from dangerous defect or deficiency as possible; see Figure 11-11. They also offer the most extensive technical education and technician certification program in the marine industry. Standards are stated in terms of desired performance. They are prepared by Project Technical Committees formed as broadly based groups of recognized authorities. All safety standards and technical reports are advisory; ABYC has no powers of enforcement.

Figure 11-11 The American Boat & Yacht Council, Inc., is a nonprofit public-service organization founded to increase safety in the design, construction, equipping, and maintenance of small craft. The volumes of its “Safety Standards” are worthwhile reading for skippers of all boats.

The ABYC does not “approve” boats, equipment, materials, or services. Some standards refer to standards of other organizations or to testing laboratories. Standards are reviewed at least every five years. New and revised standards are sent out as supplements to the complete compilation published in loose-leaf form. Included are standards for such diverse matters as “field of vision from the helm position,” “fire fighting equipment,” “gasoline fuel systems,” “AC & DC electrical systems on boats,” “lightning protection,” “hydraulic systems,” and “mechanical propulsion control systems.” The full set of 68 recommended standards is published as Standards and Technical Information Reports for Small Craft, available from the ABYC at 613 Third Street, Suite 10, Annapolis, MD 21403; 410-990-4460; www.abycinc.org. Although expensive, this is a good book to have on hand for reference.

Design, safety, and construction standards for boats as well as motors are also prepared by Underwriters Laboratory (UL), the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS), Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), Lloyds of London, North German Lloyds, International Organization of Standards (ISO), and Det Norske Veritas. Boats manufactured in any country may be built to conform to the standards set by any of these organizations.

The Marine Department of Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. Underwriters Laboratories is a not-for-profit corporation that dates from 1894; it has marine testing facilities in North Carolina, as well as other locations—UL Laboratory and Testing Facility, 12 Laboratory Drive, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709-3995; 919-549-1400; www.ul.com. It serves the industry and the boating public by conducting safety investigations and tests of marine products, by developing Marine Safety Standards, and by preparing Marine Supplements to UL Electrical Safety Standards.

The principal activity of the Marine Department is testing boating equipment for safety, a process that begins with manufacturers voluntarily submitting product samples. These are often tested for compliance with appropriate safety requirements, and evaluated for overall design and construction in relation to their use. After a product has successfully completed the evaluation and complied with all of the UL requirements, the Marine Department conducts a follow-up investigation at the factory to confirm that the manufacturer’s production controls comply with UL requirements.

A device that passes all its tests is “listed” by Underwriters Labs and may carry both on the product and in its advertising the UL “Listing Mark,” consisting of the Laboratory’s name or symbol, the product name, a control number, and the word “listed”; see Figure 11-12. The name of the device is included, with the name of the manufacturer, in the annual UL Marine Product Directory and in the online certification database on the UL website. UL does not approve or disapprove anything. Listing is an expression of UL’s good-faith opinion, based on tests, that the item meets minimum applicable safety standards. It is not a warranty of quality or performance, nor are all listed products of the same category necessarily equivalent in quality, performance, or merit.

Figure 11-12 Boating products that have passed a safety evaluation by the Marine Department of Underwriters Laboratories are “listed.” The UL label, shown above, can be used in advertising the items and may be found on them in the form of stickers or tags.

Only products commercially available are eligible for listing. New products may be submitted in their model stage for evaluation, but no final listing action is taken until production units are submitted.

The presence of a UL or UL-Marine label on any device means that a production sample has been successfully evaluated relative to safety requirements, and nothing more. The label may, however, be the basis on which “authorities having jurisdiction” grant approval for use. Such authorities include individuals making judgments for their own purposes, industry people making judgments for components of original equipment installations, marine surveyors for insurance purposes, and administrators of regulations making judgments required by law.

National Fire Protection Association This organization’s activities extend far beyond boating and marine interests to include all aspects of the science and methods of fire protection. NFPA issues codes, standards, and recommended practices for minimizing losses of life and property by fire.

NFPA does not approve, inspect, or certify any installations, procedures, equipment, or materials, and it does not approve or evaluate testing laboratories. It does prepare, by coordinated action of committees of experts, codes and standards for the guidance of all persons in the matter of fire protection. Frequently, NFPA codes and standards are written into law or regulations by various government units.

Of interest to boaters is NFPA’s booklet Fire Protection Standard No. 302 for Pleasure and Commercial Motor Craft; see Figure 11-13. It is available from the National Fire Protection Association, 1 Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02169-7471; 800-344-3555 (U.S. and Canada), 617-770-3000 (International); www.nfpa.org.

Figure 11-13 Fire Protection Standard for Pleasure and Commercial Motor Craft, NFPA No. 302, is a safety bulletin issued by the National Fire Prevention Association. It will provide useful information for any boat owner.

United States Sailing Association (US SAILING) This organization is the national governing body for the sport of sailing, whose mission is to encourage participation and excellence in sailing and racing in the United States. There is a strong emphasis on all safety aspects. Contact US SAILING at 1 Roger Williams University Way, Bristol, RI 02809; www.ussailing.org.

## CONSTRUCTION FOR SAFETY

Safety afloat starts with the design and construction of the boat itself. The typical skipper most likely did not build his own boat, but he should be able to recognize proper design features and sound construction characteristics. A boater should be reasonably familiar with safe and unsafe aspects of boat construction—the points that should be checked in determining whether or not a particular boat, new or used, should be bought—and thus avoid those that fail to measure up to desirable standards.

A boater thinking of buying a used boat should seriously consider the services of a qualified marine surveyor who is an expert in determining the condition of the hull, engine, and equipment. The surveyor may well discover defects that the would-be buyer overlooked, and his impartial survey is sound protection for a purchaser; the modest cost is well justified. Surveys are often required before a boat buyer can get a loan or insurance, particularly on older boats.

### Hull Construction

Modern boats built by reputable manufacturers are basically seaworthy if they are honestly constructed to proven designs. This points out the proper course in selection of a good, sound boat. If you have no experience in selecting a boat, get the guidance of someone who is better qualified; be sure to talk to several people to avoid personal biases.

Where possible, two means of exit should be provided from compartments where people may congregate or sleep. Thus in a small boat with only one cabin and cockpit, a forward hatch is a desirable feature.

#### Construction Materials

For seaworthiness, materials suitable for boat building and high-quality construction are both essential. Fire-retardant materials should be used wherever possible. Boats may be built equally well of wood, fiberglass, steel, or aluminum. Combinations of materials may also be used, such as an aluminum superstructure on a steel hull. Note too that boats can also be built poorly in any of these materials.

#### Safety on Deck

A medium-size or large craft may have side decks on which individuals move forward to the bow. It is essential that four safety features be present.

First, these decks must be wide enough for secure footing, even though the space may be measured in inches.

Second, if the deck is made of a material that is slippery when wet (and most are), anti-slip protection must be provided at critical points. This may consist of a built-in roughness in fiberglass decks, grit added to deck paint, or special nonskid strips attached to the deck with their own adhesive backing. Any place where someone has slipped—or could slip—needs nonskid protection; see Figure 11-14.

Figure 11-14 Antislip protection on deck walkways and at boarding areas is a must. Adhesive strips offer another means of preventing falls on decks that otherwise would be slippery, particularly when wet.

Third, there must be enough handholds—places to grab and hold on—that no one is ever beyond a secure grasp when moving forward and aft, or when embarking or debarking. The old saying “one hand for the boat and one for yourself” is an excellent one, even in calm waters; at all times, hold on to something strong enough to bear your weight.

Fourth, no boat large enough for them should be without lifelines or liferails. They are often carried forward and aft to join low metal rails at the bow (pulpit) and stern (pushpit) to enclose the deck completely.

Owners of offshore cruising sailboats would be wise to meet the requirements established by the Offshore Racing Council: There should be lifelines supported on stanchions, effectively continuous around the working deck. Horizontal rails may be substituted in pulpits. Lifelines should be permanently supported at intervals of no more than 7 feet (2.1 m) and should not pass outboard of supporting stanchions. Pulpits should be permanently installed, and their upper rails should be at least as high above the working deck as the upper lifelines, which should be 24 inches (61 cm) above the working deck. Lifelines should be stranded stainless-steel wire of no less than 5/32 inch (4 mm) for boats under 43 feet (13.1 m) LOA, or 3/16 inch (5 mm) for larger boats. These requirements are compatible with those of the American Boat & Yacht Council for lifelines and rails on both power- and sailboats.

Just because a boat has lifelines doesn’t mean you can rely on them. The stanchions should be well-made and through-bolted. On fiberglass boats, you must rely on the quality of the deck construction, but check to be sure that each stanchion base bolts through a generous backing block under the deck.

Even if your lines and stanchions pass muster, don’t conclude they are the best point of attachment for the snap of a safety harness in bad weather. A jackline (a dock line or a length of flat webbing stretched between the mooring cleat on the foredeck and a cleat on the stern; see this page) has a number of advantages as a point of attachment, as it allows you to move about the deck without having to stop, unsnap, and snap on again as you must do at each stanchion if you rely on the lifelines.

#### Superstructure & Stability

The belief that a boat can carry weight anywhere as long as it appears to trim right can be dangerous. Addition of more superstructures, such as a flying bridge, is often particularly bad, as is shifting heavy weights such as motors, ballast, tanks, and machinery. Where stability is concerned, no shifts of major weights or changes in design should be considered without advice from a qualified naval architect. Boat owners sometimes ruin boats and reduce their safety factors by deviating from architect’s specifications for weight distribution.

#### Through-Hull Fittings

Through-hull fittings that are located near or below the waterline should have seacocks installed to permit positive closing. It is desirable to have solid, noncorroding metal pipe extending from the seacock to a level above the waterline, from which point flexible hoses may be run to the pump or other accessory. Where hose is placed over pipe nipples for connections, use two hose clamps, not just one; see Figure 11-15. Through-hull fittings and seacocks that have been safety evaluated and “listed” by the Underwriters Laboratories are available. ABYC Safety Standard H-27 furnishes additional information on these.

Figure 11-15 Every through-hull fitting should have a seacock to shut off water entry should a hose fail on equipment served by that fitting. When the handle is aligned with the barrel, as here, the seacock is open. To close the cock, turn the handle 90 degrees.

## ENGINES & FUEL SYSTEMS

Fires and explosions on boats are usually traceable to the engine room or galley, where improper equipment, faulty installation, or careless operation and maintenance are the direct cause. All these causes are under the owner’s control.

### Engine Installation

Engines should be suited to the hulls they power. Extremes of either underpowering or overpowering can be dangerous. Original installations and subsequent changes require the advice of a naval architect or someone thoroughly familiar with that phase of boat design.

Amateur conversions of automobile engines for marine use may be a source of trouble because of basic differences between the two types. Lubrication and cooling are the chief problems. Select an accepted type of marine engine or a commercially produced conversion instead.

Drip pans should be installed under the engine. The exterior of a properly operating engine should be totally dry. Any fluid in the pan should be investigated and removed immediately.

### Fuel Systems

The primary aspect of fuel system safety is the prevention of fires and explosions. Not to be overlooked, however, are the reliability aspects of the system that will ensure a continuous flow of clean fuel to the engine. The discussion that follows is principally concerned with boats using gasoline engines; exceptions and requirements relating to diesel fuel systems are covered separately.

The Coast Guard has complex technical requirements for fuel systems of all boats having gasoline engines for propulsion or for producing electrical or mechanical power on board. These are requirements for manufacturers of new boats, but they can serve as an excellent guide for boat owners. These standards can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 33: Navigation and Navigable Waters, Chapter 1, Part 183: Boats and Associated Equipment, which can be accessed online via links from www.uscgboating.org.

#### Fire Prevention

A boat’s entire fuel system must be liquid- and vapor-tight with respect to the hull interior. Gasoline fumes mixed with air are an explosive combination. These fumes, several times heavier than air, settle to the bottom of the bilge. A concentration of gasoline in the air as low as 1.25 percent—a half-teacup, a few ounces of gasoline—can create enough explosive vapor to totally destroy a large boat.

The obvious answer is prevention—make it impossible for gasoline, either in liquid or gaseous form, to get into the bilge in the first place. Then keep the bilge clean and ventilate the engine compartment thoroughly, and there will be nothing that can be ignited.

Leakage of liquid gasoline into the bilge can be prevented by a properly installed fuel system that uses strongly built gasoline tanks, approved tubing for fuel lines, leakproof connections, tight fittings, and lengths of flexible metallic fuel hose to take care of vibration. As discussed earlier, keep gasoline vapors created when the tanks are filled from finding their way down through open hatches and companionways. Finally, do not permit sparks and flames in the engine room.

#### Carburetors & Air Intakes

Carburetors (on engines that use these rather than fuel injectors) must be equipped with flame arresters for protection against backfire; see Figure 11-16. If not of the downdraft type, they should also have a pan covered with a fine mesh screen attached under the carburetor to collect any drip. Leakage will be sucked back into the engine if a copper tube is run from the bottom of the pan to the intake manifold. Keep carburetor and fuel-injection intake air-flame arresters clean both for safety and best engine operation.

Figure 11-16 A carburetor on a marine gasoline engine (other than outboard motors) must be equipped with a flame arrester. A downdraft carburetor, as shown here, does not require a drip pan, but an updraft model (now rare) requires one.

#### Gasoline Fuel Tanks & Gauges

Permanent gasoline fuel tanks must be installed securely to prevent any motion in a seaway. Using portable tanks belowdecks is not good practice.

Gasoline fuel tanks must be constructed of a metal that is compatible with both the fuel and a normal marine environment. Copper, copper alloys of certain specific composition, hot-dipped galvanized sheet steel, and aluminum are all used for gasoline tanks. In each case, construction, installation, and inspections should be in accordance with standards of the American Boat & Yacht Council.

Monel (a nickel-copper alloy) is a superb tank material but too expensive for ordinary use. The ABYC has approved 316L and 317L stainless steel for diesel tanks but not for gasoline tanks of 20 gallons or more. Small polyethylene tanks are readily available in a variety of shapes and provide excellent service. Fiberglass is attacked by the ethanol that is now in gasoline; until that is worked out, fiberglass tanks should be avoided. Terneplate steel (sheet steel coated with a lead-tin alloy), once commonly used for fuel tanks, should no longer be used.

Gasoline tanks must not be integral with the hull. The shape of the tank should be such that there are no exterior pockets that would trap moisture after the tank is in its installed position. Tank bottoms must not have sumps or pockets in which water could accumulate.

Internal stiffeners and baffle plates are used to provide necessary rigidity and resistance to surging of liquid in the tanks. Baffles must meet certain specified design criteria to prevent formation of liquid pockets in the bottom of tanks and vapor pockets in the tops.

There should be no drains or outlets for drawing off fuel from the tank, nor outlets or fittings of any type in the bottom, sides, or ends of tanks. Fuel lines to the engine should enter the tank at its top and internally extend nearly to the bottom.

A fuel-level indicator, if used, should be of an approved type.

#### Fuel Filler Pipes & Vents

One of the most essential requirements in the proper installation of a fuel system is that there be a completely tight connection between the gasoline tank and the filling plate on deck. The fuel fill must be located so any spillage will go overboard, not inside the hull, and tight pipe connections between deck plate and tank will prevent leakage or spillage below. Fill pipes, at least 1½-inch (3.8 cm) inside diameter, should run down inside the tank nearly to the bottom to lessen the production of vapors.

A suitable vent pipe for each tank should lead outside the hull; vents should never terminate in closed places such as the engine compartment or under the deck. Minimum inside diameter of vent pipes should be 7/16 inch (11 mm). Where a vent ends on the hull, the outlet should be fitted with a removable flame screen to protect against flashbacks from outside sources of ignition. In boats that normally heel, such as auxiliary sailboats, it may be necessary to have dual vents with the port tank vent led to the starboard side and vice versa.

Nonmetallic hose may be used as a coupling between sections of metallic fill piping. The hose must be reinforced or of sufficient thickness to prevent collapse. A grounding jumper wire must be installed across the nonconducting section to provide a complete electrical path from the deck fitting to the fuel tank, which in turn is grounded.

If the fuel supply for an auxiliary generator is not drawn from the main tank, the separate tank should be installed with its own filler and vent.

#### Fuel Lines

Fuel lines should be run in sight as much as possible for ease of inspection, protected from possible damage, and secured against vibration by soft nonferrous metal clips with rounded edges. Soft copper tubing is the long-standing choice for gasoline and diesel fuel lines—and copper-nickel, nickel-copper, and stainless steel are also acceptable—but reinforced nonmetallic hose is a better choice, being cheaper, easier to install, and less likely to harden and crack. A short length of flexible tubing with suitable fittings should be used between the part of a metal fuel line that is secured to the hull and the part that is secured to the engine itself—this will prevent leakage or breakage as a result of vibration.

If reinforced nonmetallic hose is used for the full distance from the tank shutoff valve to the engine, the line should be visible and accessible for its entire length. Wherever used, nonmetallic hose must be dated by the manufacturer and not used for a period longer than that recommended by the maker. The use of ethanol-blended gasoline requires significantly greater attention to the condition of the fuel and the fuel system.

Tube fittings should be of nonferrous drawn or forged metal of the flared type, and metal tubing should be properly flared by tools designed for the purpose.

A shutoff valve should be installed in the fuel line directly at the tank connection. Arrangements should be provided for ready access and operation of this valve from outside the compartment in which tanks are located, preferably from abovedeck. Where engine and fuel tank are separated by a distance exceeding 12 feet (3.7 m), an approved-type manual stop-valve should be installed at the engine end of the fuel line to stop fuel flow when servicing accessories.

Valves should be of nonferrous metal with ground seats installed to close against the flow. Types that depend on packing to prevent leakage at the stem should not be used. For fuel and oil lines, a type of diaphragm packless valve is available that is pressure-tight in any position. A UL-listed electric fuel valve shuts off the flow of gasoline whenever the ignition switch is turned off; it can also be independently turned off in an emergency.

#### Fuel Pumps & Filters

Electric fuel pumps, where used, should be located at the engine end of fuel lines. They must be connected so that they operate only when the ignition switch is on.

A filter should be installed in the fuel line inside the engine compartment, properly supported so that its weight is not carried by the tubing. Closure of the filter must be designed so that opening it for cleaning will not cause fuel to spill. It should also be designed so that the unit can be disassembled and reassembled in dim light without undue opportunity for crossing threads, displacing gaskets or seals, or assembling parts in an improper order that might result in fuel seepage after assembly. Fuel filter bowls should be highly resistant to shattering from impact and resistant to failure from thermal shock.

#### Fuel-Vapor Detectors

A fuel-vapor detector is considered by many boaters to be an essential item of safety equipment on board any craft using gasoline as a fuel. These devices provide a visual, and in many units an audible, warning of the buildup of any dangerous concentration of fuel vapor in the engine space and bilges; see Figure 11-17. It is important to remember, however, that they are not an absolutely positive means of alerting you to a hazardous condition; they are not as infallible as the human nose. If in doubt, open the spaces and use your nose—it is the best “bilge sniffer.”

Figure 11-17 Fuel-vapor detectors are considered essential safety items onboard a vessel using gasoline as a fuel, but the human nose is the best and most reliable detector.

Fuel-vapor detectors come in several designs, each with good points and disadvantages. These include hot-wire, cold-sensor, and semiconductor types of detector units. Price does not vary much between these types, and a choice should be made on the features of the designs and their suitability for your particular installation. Some sensors will detect hazardous levels of other gases such as propane (LPG), carbon monoxide, or hydrogen (from storage-battery charging).

Installing a fuel-vapor detector is not difficult electrically or mechanically, but it must be done correctly. The location of the detector unit is most important; the alarm display must be where it will be seen and heard. When completed, have your installation inspected by a surveyor or a safety inspector from your insurance company.

#### Fuel Systems for Outboards

Fuel tanks and systems permanently installed in the hull of outboard-powered boats should be designed, constructed, and installed in accordance with the previously stated principles. No pressurized tanks should be built into or permanently attached to the hulls. A quick-disconnect coupling may be used between motor and fuel line but, when disconnected, it must automatically shut off fuel flow from the tank with a minimum of spillage; see Figure 11-18.

Figure 11-18 Portable fuel tanks used with outboard motors are equipped with quick-disconnect fittings designed to minimize fuel leakage when connecting and disconnecting.

Be cautious in using polyethylene containers for storing gasoline; they can accumulate a static charge that is not drained off by grounding connections. A static electricity-generated spark could ignite vapors in the container.

Polyethylene containers should meet fire retardance and fuel-compatibility requirements of ABYC. The containers should carry the approval of a national listing agency or a major city fire department. Do not use any other type of plastic container for gasoline or other flammable liquid. Stow any portable fuel container in a well-ventilated place, protected from both physical damage and exposure to direct sunlight. Any leakage or vapors must drain overboard.

Be extremely careful that not even a single drop of gasoline finds its way into the bilge. Proper bilge ventilation is a strict legal requirement and vital safety measure; see Chapter 3.

#### Fuel Systems of Diesel-Powered Boats

Fuel systems of diesel-powered boats generally conform to safety standards for gasoline-fueled vessels, with a few exceptions as required or permitted by the nature of the fuel and characteristics of diesel engines.

Tanks for diesel fuel may be iron or steel as well as nickel-copper. They may be painted if not galvanized externally; iron tanks must not be galvanized internally. Fiberglass is an excellent material for diesel tanks, and the ABYC now accepts 316L and 317L stainless steel for diesel tanks if properly welded. Diesel tanks may have a sump or pocket in the bottom for collection of water. Tanks for diesel fuel may be integral with the hull.

Fuel lines for diesel fuel may be of iron or steel pipe or tubing in addition to the metals approved for gasoline. A return line to carry excess fuel from the engine back to the tank is needed.

#### Additional Information

Many additional technical details on gasoline and diesel fuel systems for boats will be found in ABYC Safety Standards H-24, H-25, and H-33.

Underwriters Laboratories Marine Division has evaluated and accepted for listing a number of tanks, filters, valves, and related equipment by various manufacturers.

##### SAFEGUARDING AGAINST CARBON MONOXIDE

Although most recreational boaters are conscious of potential dangers on the water, the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning is often overlooked. It is important to know the facts about this invisible killer and to take the necessary steps to ensure safety on board. Carbon monoxide (CO) gas is clear and odorless, and may be present even when exhaust smoke is not.

Its initial toxic symptoms are deceptively similar to those of seasickness: headaches, dizziness, and lack of coordination as well as other symptoms such as drowsiness. Moreover, the individual who experiences symptoms of carbon-monoxide poisoning tends to lose any healthy fear that danger is imminent.

When carbon monoxide is inhaled, CO molecules attach themselves to red blood cells—as oxygen molecules do in a person who is breathing clean air. The result is a lack of oxygen for the tissues with subsequent death of the tissue and, if prolonged, death of that person.

###### PRECAUTIONS

A boater whose craft is equipped with a permanently installed gasoline engine, permanently installed or portable gasoline-powered genset (auxiliary generating plant for 120-volt AC power, see Chapter 19), or any fuel-burning stove, heater, cooking grille, or lamp must be constantly alert to the danger of CO poisoning. Adequate ventilation must be maintained at all times.

Cabin cruisers are particularly susceptible to problems involving carbon-monoxide poisoning. The best way to prevent CO from getting into passenger areas and sleeping spaces is to provide alternate sources of air. For example, leave a part of the windshield open and open a deck hatch. If you can feel a flow of air coming aft through the cabin and cockpit areas, you can reduce the chances that carbon monoxide will be pulled forward and into the boat due to backdrafting.

Backdrafting is caused by air movement over or around a boat, creating a low-pressure area at the stern that can increase CO levels on board. Dangerous concentrations of CO can also accumulate when a boat’s engine or generator is operated while the boat is alongside other boats, next to a seawall, or in a confined area such as a boathouse. Be aware of the effect that your craft’s exhaust may have on other vessels; likewise, be aware that another vessel’s equipment may affect the CO levels on your boat.

Regular inspections and proper maintenance are the ways to prevent CO leaks from exhaust systems. Look and listen for leaks in exhaust systems of generators and propulsion engines. Look for discoloration around joints in the system. Make sure that all hose clamps in the exhaust system are secured properly. Double-clamping rubber hose connections at each end will help prevent the exhaust hose from vibrating loose. All holes or gaps in the engine room bulkheads for plumbing, wiring, and controls should be sealed.

Never allow in-water activities near the stern exhaust when an engine or genset is running.

Carbon monoxide gas detectors should be considered by all safety-conscious skippers.

###### WHAT TO DO

In the event that a person on board displays symptoms of CO poisoning, immediately evacuate all enclosed spaces; give the affected individual oxygen if it is available; contact medical help, and if the person is not breathing, perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

### Exhaust Systems

Exhaust lines and pipes should be installed so that they cannot scorch or ignite woodwork. Where necessary, gratings can be used to prevent gear from touching the line. Exhaust systems must be gas-tight, and constructed and installed so that they can be inspected and repaired readily along their entire length. Any leaks must be rectified at once to prevent escape of exhaust gases into various compartments. Carbon monoxide is a deadly odorless gas.

A “wet” exhaust system requires a continuous flow of cooling water (from the heat exchanger or the engine block) discharged through the exhaust line, entering as close to the manifold as possible. Exhaust systems of the “dry stack” type (no cooling water) operate at considerably higher temperatures, and their use is relatively rare except on larger vessels and commercial fishing boats.

An exhaust system should be run with a minimum number of bends. Where turns are necessary, use long-sweep elbows or multiple 45° ells to avoid tight bends. The exhaust system must not cause back pressure at the exhaust manifold greater than that specified by the engine manufacturer. A small pipe tap, located not more than 6 inches (15.2 cm) from the exhaust manifold outlet, should be provided for measuring back pressure.

The exhaust system should be designed to prevent undue stress on the exhaust manifold, particularly where an engine is shock-mounted. All supports, hangers, brackets, and other fittings in contact with the exhaust should be noncombustible and so constructed that high temperatures will not be transmitted to wood or other combustible materials to which fittings are secured.

The exhaust piping or tubing of engines installed above the waterline should have a continuous downward pitch of at least ½ inch per foot (1 cm per 24 cm) and must be designed and installed to eliminate any possibility of cooling water or seawater returning to the engine manifold through the exhaust system.

#### Exhaust Systems for Sailboat Engines

Exhaust systems for auxiliary-powered sailboats should be designed to prevent sea or cooling water from running back into the engine when these are installed close to or below the waterline. A riser should reach above the waterline sufficiently to allow a steep drop-off; see the manufacturer’s installation instructions for the specific height. The high point should be a gooseneck, with cooling water injected aft of this point; see Figure 11-19. Any dry section of an exhaust system must be adequately insulated with materials that can withstand the high temperatures involved. As an alternate arrangement, installation of a water-trap silencer is recommended.

Figure 11-19 The ABYC standard for small-craft engine exhaust systems has special provisions for auxiliary sailboats. When an engine is located below the waterline, a high-rising loop must be installed in the exhaust line to bring it above the waterline. Dimensions may vary; see the instruction manual for your engine.

#### Flexible Exhaust Lines

Steam hose or other nonmetallic material may be used for exhaust lines where greater flexibility is desired. Every flexible line of this type must be secured with adequate clamps of corrosion-resistant metal at each end. Hose used for this purpose must have a wall thickness and rigidity sufficient to prevent collapse or internal separation of plies. Full-length nonmetallic exhaust tubing may be used in wet exhaust systems providing it is water-cooled throughout its length and is not subjected to temperature above 280°F (138°C). Tubing used for exhaust service should be specifically constructed for that purpose and so labeled by the manufacturer. Tubing should be installed in a manner that will not stress or crimp the inner or outer plies.

#### Additional Information

ABYC Safety Standard P-1 provides much additional information on “wet” and “dry” exhaust installations. It should be studied by anyone building or rebuilding a boat equipped with an inboard engine.

## ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS

A boat’s entire electrical installation should comply with the best safety practices. Requirements of marine installations are more exacting than for applications where salt- and moisture-laden atmospheres are not prevalent. Wiring and other electrical equipment should be installed correctly in the beginning and kept safe by frequent inspection. Detailed information on boat electrical systems can be found in Chapter 19.

### Lightning Protection

You only infrequently hear of a boat, power or sail, being struck by lightning, but this can and does happen. And when it does happen, serious, even fatal, consequences may ensue. You can add to both your physical safety and your peace of mind by getting adequate basic information and taking certain precautions.

The voltages involved in lightning are tremendous—materials normally considered to be nonconductive become conductors, and that includes the human body. The voltages are so high that if they start to travel through a boat’s structure—say, through its mast—then meet high resistance—for instance, the hull’s skin—the current discharge, in its drive to reach ground potential, may simply blow a hole in the nonconductive barrier.

#### Protection Principles

The theory in any shipboard lightning protection system is to create what is known as a “Faraday’s cage,” after the nineteenth-century scientist Michael Faraday. The principle of a Faraday’s cage is to provide a surrounding, well-grounded metal structure, all of whose parts are bonded together and at the same electrical potential. Such a cage may possibly increase the likelihood of a lightning strike, but if one does occur, it carries the charge directly to ground, thereby protecting life and limb within its boundaries.

On a boat, the cage is formed by bonding together, with heavy conductors, a sailboat’s mast and all other major metal masses—for example, engines, stoves, air-conditioning compressors, railings, arches and the like—and providing a direct, low-resistance conductive path to ground (the water), usually via the engine and propeller shaft, or keel bolts, or, even better, a separate external ground plate, at least 1 ft2 (0.093 m2) in area. (Although actual data are not available, it is believed that a long narrow strip, for example, 1 inch by 12 feet, is more effective than a 1-foot square plate.) Of course, it’s necessary to ensure that crew fall within the protection of the confines of the cage, something that is not always feasible when the vessel is not built of steel or aluminum. And in this respect, on a fiberglass or wooden craft, it’s advantageous to have a mast or other conductive metal protrusion extending well above the vessel, creating what is known as a “cone” or zone of protection.

It’s generally accepted that this zone of protection extends 45 degrees from the vertical from all around the tip of such a metal protrusion; see Figure 11-20. Thus, if the aluminum mast of the average sailing vessel is properly bonded to the vessel’s other major metal masses and given a direct, low-resistance conductive path to ground, essentially the entire boat should fall within the protected zone, that is, inside the cage. If a sailing vessel has a wooden or plastic composite mast, the same effect can be achieved by installing a 6- to 12-inch metal spike at the masthead and running a sufficiently heavy conductor from it down the mast and as directly as possible to ground. To provide an adequately grounded conductor or protective mast, the entire circuit from the masthead to the ground (water) connection should have conductivity equivalent to a No. 4-gauge wire, recently increased from the previous recommended size of No. 8. (Any copper strip used should not be thinner than No. 20 gauge, 0.032 inch, 0.8 mm.) An aluminum or steel hull, of course, constitutes an excellent ground connection to the water. The path followed by the grounding conductor should be essentially straight, with no sharp bends.

Figure 11-20 A measure of lightning protection can be obtained by using the principle of a “Faraday’s cage.” A high, pointed conductor, heavily wired to all of the conductive parts of the boat, seems to cast a cone-shaped umbrella in which lightning does not strike. Instead, the electricity is conducted safely to “ground” in the water via submerged metal parts such as the rudder, propeller, sailboat keel, or special ground plate.

In the case of powerboats, ensuring sufficient mast height is quite often difficult; and it may not be possible, given the limitations, to ensure that a person standing on deck always falls within the zone of protection. Keep in mind that you cannot rely on fiberglass radio antennas for this purpose, as they do not afford a sufficiently low-resistance path, and possibly because of their construction, no path at all. (The most common antennas, those used for VHF, CB, or SSB radios, offer no conductive path.) The best advice in such cases is to work with an expert in the field, if you’re considering the possibility of using an antenna as a lightning mast.

It is possible in a powerboat to install a separate lightning mast. But, if the mast is hinged for getting under bridges or for general nonthreatening conditions, a jumper of adequately heavy wire should be installed to provide a bypass around the hinge. In all cases on powerboats, it will generally be necessary to pay close attention to keeping crew within the zone of protection and isolated from contact with any metal objects during a lightning storm.

If there are metal objects of considerable size within a few feet of the grounding conductor, there will be a strong tendency for sparks or side flashes to jump to them from the grounding conductor. To prevent such possibly damaging flashes, an interconnecting conductor of the same size should be provided at all likely places.

Metal objects situated wholly on a boat’s exterior should be connected to the grounding conductor at their upper or nearest end. Metal objects within the boat may be connected to the lightning protective system directly or through the bonding system for underwater metal parts.

Metal objects that project through cabin tops, decks, etc., should be bonded to the nearest lightning conductor at the point where the object emerges from the boat and again at its extreme lowest end within the boat. Spotlights and other objects projecting through cabin tops should be solidly grounded regardless of the cone of protection.

Remember: A lightning protection system offers no protection when the boat is out of the water.

Additional information on lightning protection will be found in ABYC Standard TE-4.

##### LIGHTNING PROTECTION FOR PERSONNEL

The basic purpose of lightning protection is safety for people; everyone on board should take the following precautions.

• Stay inside a closed boat as much as possible during an electrical storm.

• Put on a PFD; if hit by lightning, you may become unconscious and fall overboard.

• Avoid making contact with any item connected to a lightning protective conductor, and especially in a way that bridges two parts of the grounding system.

• Stay out of the water; keep hands and feet out of the water.

### Danger from Overhead Power Lines

Although it is not related to lightning hazards, a skipper should be aware of the fact that sailboats face a serious danger from contact with overhead power lines—both underway and, more often, as they are being launched or hauled out. Sailors must always be aware of power lines and be sure of their clearances. A lightning protection system is not designed to provide protection if any part of the boat comes in contact with power lines while afloat or ashore.

## EQUIPMENT FOR SAFETY

Some safety equipment is required by law and Coast Guard regulations. These requirements are generally written in such broad language, however, that boaters need additional knowledge and guidance. Boats need to have numerous additional items of equipment beyond the legal minimum to achieve a full measure of safety. Additional devices and pieces of equipment are desirable for operational efficiency and convenience. Many of these are discussed in Chapter 3 and other chapters. This chapter supplements equipment considerations covered elsewhere in the book.

### Lifesaving Equipment

As noted in Chapter 3, each boat must, by law, have a personal flotation device (PFD) for each person on board, and waterskiers towed behind are counted as being “on board.” A wise skipper does not skimp on quality or quantity of his life jackets, making sure that he has enough even if a few unexpected guests show up.

Where the type of life jacket used comes in different sizes, such as adult and children’s life preservers, or the three sizes of buoyant vests, the life jacket must be of an appropriate size for the person who is to wear it.

Although the regulations allow a choice from several categories of life jackets, the safety-conscious skipper will choose Type I. This type provides the maximum buoyancy and will hold a person’s face clear of the water so he can breathe even though unconscious. The exception to this maxim is the use of inflatable life jackets: their greater degree of comfort while being worn increases the likelihood that they will be worn a greater percentage of the time on board.

### Fire Extinguishers

Beyond the legal minimum requirements, ABYC Safety Standards A-4 makes a number of recommendations that should be considered. On inboard or inboard/outboard boats with an engine compartment, there should be provision for discharging a CO2 or other chemical-vapor extinguisher directly into the engine space without opening the primary access. This will prevent the addition of oxygen that would further fuel the fire; remaining outside the compartment containing the fire will also increase the personal safety of the individual using the extinguisher. A caution sign should be posted to not open the engine compartment.

The ABYC Standards includes recommendations for the appropriate size of extinguishers for various volumes or engine compartments. Regardless of the type or size of installed system, it is recommended that there be a sign at each helm position to shut down the engine immediately when the extinguisher activates—if the engine is not shut down, a portion of the extinguishing agent will be sucked into the engine, and thus its extinguishing capability will be lost.

### Pumps & Bailers

There are no federal requirements that a boat (if used exclusively for recreation) be equipped with a bailing device, but all boats should be equipped with some form of pump or bailer. Too many skippers place their full dependence on electric bilge pumps, and perhaps on only one of those. Once water rises in the bilge high enough to short out the battery, the pump is out of action. (On most boats the batteries are placed low in the bilge—excellent for stability, but not for safety if the boat starts taking on water.)

Only the smallest boats should depend on a hand bailer or bucket. Other boats should be equipped with a manually operated pump of generous capacity. Such an item can be either a fixed installation or a portable pump stowed where it can be quickly and easily reached when needed.

#### Bilge Water Alarms

Electric bilge pumps are normally actuated by float switches. These are generally reliable and provide a great convenience, but are not to be solely depended upon. Safety is much enhanced by the installation of a bilge water alarm. This quite simple system consists of an additional water level sensing switch mounted at a level that is a few inches above that of the switch that operates the bilge pump. This is wired to a source of 12-volt DC power and one or more alarms, both visible and audible. One such alarm should be at the normal helm position and another near the skipper’s sleeping location. The audible alarms should be loud enough to be heard over the normal noise level of the engines, and loud enough to awaken a sleeping person. Additional alarms around the boat are probably not needed, as conditions are quiet enough at anchor or when docked that one or both of the alarms will be heard. For boats stored in a slip, an external alarm may be rigged to alert marina personnel of a flooding condition.

### Distress Signaling Equipment

A boat’s radio is probably the most often used and effective means of summoning assistance in an emergency. Use of the radio for this purpose is covered in Chapter 20. Cell phones should not be relied upon for distress communications. The legal requirements for visual distress signals are covered on this page. A distress signal can also be made to other vessels in sight by slowly raising and lowering one’s arms stretched out to each side or by use of a signaling mirror. In a pinch, a CD will serve as a mirror.

Signal flares may be projected several hundred feet into the air by a special type of pistol. The laws of several states regulate possession of these and similar explosive projectile devices; check before putting one on board, but if permissible, these are effective items of safety equipment.

Flares can be single- or double-ended, the latter producing a bright flame at one end for night use and a dense smoke at the other end for day distress situations. Before using any flare, read all instructions carefully so as to avoid personal injury or aggravation of the emergency. Read before any emergency arises. Your preparation for emergencies and the training of your crew should include familiarization with all distress signaling equipment.

Distress signaling equipment of any type should be stored in protective, waterproof containers and stowed where it is readily available for use in an emergency or to be taken off the boat if it must be abandoned. Contents should be inspected at least annually; flares have an expiration date and must be replaced periodically.

### Miscellaneous Items of Safety Equipment

There are many small items of equipment that increase safety and convenience.

All but the smallest boats should be equipped with several flashlights and at least one battery-powered electric lantern. Flashlights should be distributed where they will be quickly available in an emergency. One should be within reach of the skipper’s bunk. There should also be a flashlight in the guest cabin, if any, and another on the bridge. Batteries in all units should be checked monthly to be sure of sufficient power. All should be completely waterproof, and lanterns should be the kind that will float if dropped overboard.

An installed searchlight of adequate intensity is desirable on medium-size and large boats. It is useful both in routine navigation and docking, and in emergencies such as man-overboard situations or assisting another boat in distress.

Boats of medium or large size should have on board some means, such as a hatchet, of cutting lines in an emergency.

Tools and repair parts for the engine and major accessories can be considered parts of a boat’s essential safety equipment. Personal experience and conversation with seasoned skippers will offer the best guidance to just what tools and parts should be carried aboard any particular boat. Insofar as possible, tools should be of rust-proof metal; tools susceptible to rust or corrosion, and all spare parts, should be given a protective coating, and stowed to protect them from adverse effects of a marine environment.

All but the smallest boats should carry emergency drinking water and food supplies—a life raft must, and a dinghy should, have such items. The amount will vary with the number of persons normally on board. The type of food is not important—anything will do when you get hungry enough! Nonperishability over a long period is important, but it might be wise once each year to consume your emergency supplies (a shipwreck party?) after they have been replaced with a fresh stock. Such items can usually be purchased from marine supply stores or from army-navy surplus stores; food should be simple and compact, but sustaining and energy-producing.

First-aid kits are essential safety items; refer to the sidebar, “Basic First-Aid Kit,” opposite.

Navigation equipment, charts, and ground tackle are all items of safety equipment, but each is considered in detail elsewhere in this book; see index.

Figure 11-21 The SOS Distress Light is an electronic flare that floats, can be safely hand-held, and meets USCG requirements for a nighttime distress signal, making it a viable replacement for traditional flares, which expire after 42 months and are environmentally hazardous. Its bright LED flashes a Morse code SOS that can be seen for miles and lasts up to 60 hours.

### Safety Aspects of Other Equipment

Several items generally found on boats are not safety equipment per se, but have definite aspects of safety about their design, installation, or operation that must be considered by boat owners.

##### BASIC FIRST-AID KIT

In addition to at least one comprehensive first-aid manual, your boat should be equipped with a first-aid kit designed specifically for your needs, according to the length of your voyages and the areas in which you cruise.

Day and weekend boaters, for example, need at least a kit stocked with basics, such as a thermometer, tweezers, alcohol, sunscreen, bandages of various sizes, scissors, an eye-washing cup, and a hot-water bottle/ice bag. Use of more advanced items requires proper training.

Depending on the cruising waters and the crewmembers aboard, it may also be wise to stock items such as remedies for seasickness and jellyfish stings. Long-range offshore cruisers require more extensive first-aid supplies and lifesaving equipment, as well as a wide range of prescription medications. In order to reduce the caregiver’s risk of infection, every first-aid kit should also include a waterless antiseptic hand cleaner and disposable gloves.

When assembling your first-aid kit, consult more than one source to assess your needs. There are a number of books available on the subject of first aid for boaters and medical emergencies at sea. Also discuss your needs with the instructors of any first-aid or safe-boating courses in which you enroll. Finally, get your doctor’s advice. If you stock prescription medications, make sure the expiration dates are clearly marked, and that each prescription is replaced when necessary. An off-the-shelf kit may be the starting point, but you may need to add further items to meet your specific requirements. Once your supplies are assembled, store them in a watertight plastic container (to avoid rusting problems) in a dry, secure compartment. Review your kit periodically, making sure that it continues to suit your needs, that each item is in good working order, and that medicines have not become outdated.

A number of companies offer kits designed for various boating needs—ranging from basic kits for day outings and short local cruises (above) to more extensive offshore cruising kits. Be sure to add any necessary supplies not included in the kit.

#### Galley Stoves

Galley stoves should be designed, manufactured, and approved for marine use. Types of fuel that are ordinarily used include alcohol, kerosene, electricity, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), also known as propane. Some boats are now using compressed natural gas (CNG) as stove fuel. Stoves fueled with coal, wood, diesel oil, or canned heat (solidified alcohol) are only rarely seen. Gasoline is not a safe stove fuel and should never be used on a boat.

Electricity is probably the safest source of heat for cooking, but shore power or an auxiliary generating plant is required to produce the large amounts of AC power required. Unpressurized alcohol stoves are used on some boats, although their high fuel cost and relatively low heating efficiency have reduced their popularity. Water will extinguish an alcohol fire but may spread the flames.

LPG stoves are excellent for cooking, but can present a serious safety hazard unless installed and operated in accordance with strict rules. An excellent guide to a safe LPG installation will be found in ABYC Safety Standard A-1. Propane tanks for marine use now must have an overfill protection device (OPD) when they are bought or taken in for a refill; the only exception is made for certain horizontal tanks. Existing tanks can be retrofitted with an OPD valve at a cost of about one-third that of replacing the tank.

Stoves should be securely fastened in place when in operation; see Figure 11-22. Portable stoves are not recommended; if one must be used, it should be secured while in use. Adequate ventilation should be provided to prevent too much heat when a stove is operated for extended periods of time. All woodwork and other combustible material around a stove, including smoke stacks, must be effectively protected with noncombustible sheathing, such as ⅛-inch (3.1 mm) heat-resistant board covered by sheet metal. Keep curtains and fabrics away from stoves.

Figure 11-22 Galley stoves should be permanently and securely fastened in place. They should have guardrails that will keep pots and pans from sliding off the front. On sailboats, stoves are often gimbaled so that the cooking surface remains nearly level when the boat heels.

Fuel for alcohol and kerosene stoves may be supplied to the burners either by gravity or pressure systems, provided fuel tanks cannot be filled while the burners are in operation except where the supply tank is remote from burners and the filling operation will not introduce a fire hazard. A removable or accessible liquid-tight metal drip pan at least ¾-inch (1.9-cm) deep should be provided under all burners. Pressure tanks should have suitable gauges and/or relief valves.

##### VESSEL SAFETY-CHECK REQUIREMENTS

The long-time Courtesy Marine Examination program of the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary has been expanded, revised, and renamed. The new Vessel Safety Check (VSC) program now includes checks by members of the United States Power Squadrons as well as members of the USCG Auxiliary.

A Vessel Safety Check is a courtesy examination of your boat to verify the presence and condition of safety equipment required by federal regulations, plus certain additional requirements. A boat must also meet any requirements of the state in which it is being examined.

Following the examination, the specially trained examiner will also make recommendations and discuss safety issues that may make you a safer boater. This is not a law enforcement action; no citations will be issued as a result of the examination. You will receive a copy of the evaluation of your boat so that you may follow the suggestions given. The examination is free, and boats that pass the examination will be able to display the distinctive VSC decal (actually, a sticker), which is valid until the end of the calendar year in which it was issued. This does not exempt your boat from law enforcement boarding.

The requirements for the decal, listed below, make a good checklist for any well-equipped boat.

###### NUMBERING & PAPERWORK

The boat must be properly registered by a state or documented by the Coast Guard; the paperwork must be on board; refer to Chapter 2.

For state-registered boats, the registration numbers must be permanently displayed on each side of the forward half of the boat; they read from left to right, and there must be no other numbers. The letters and numerals must be plain, vertical, block characters not less than three inches high, and in a color contrasting with the background. A dash or a space equal in width to a letter must separate the numerals from the letters that precede and follow them; for example, FL-1235-AB or FL 1234 AB. Any state validation sticker should be placed in accordance with that state’s requirements.

For a documented boat, the documentation number must be permanently marked on a visible part of the interior structure. A recreational craft’s name and hailing port must be displayed in letters not less than four inches in height on some clearly visible exterior part of the hull; no specific location is required. The hailing port must consist of both a city and a state; only the state may be abbreviated.

###### PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICES (PFDS)

An approved personal flotation device in good serviceable condition, and of a suitable size, is required for each person on the boat, with a minimum of one throwable for boats 16 feet (4.9 m) and over. Children must have properly fitted PFDs designed for children and suitable for their size. (Children’s PFDs come in various sizes marked for the weight of the user.)

Wearable PFDs, including inflatable PFDs, must be readily accessible; throwable devices must be immediately available. PFDs must not be stored in unopened plastic packaging. All PFDs on board will be examined even if there are more than the legally required minimum.

For an inflatable PFD to count toward the legal requirements, the person (16 or more years of age) for whom it is intended must be wearing it if the label so states.

###### VISUAL DISTRESS SIGNALS

To receive VSC approval, recreational boats 16 feet (4.9 m) and over used on coastal waters or the Great Lakes must have Coast Guard-approved day and night visual distress signals (VDS) that have not reached their expiration dates. Manufacture and expirations dates must be legible to meet decal requirements. Signals with expired dates are allowed on board as excess equipment. VDSs must be properly protected from moisture damage and readily accessible for use. Some signals, such as red flares, can serve for both day and night requirements. See Chapter 3.

###### FIRE EXTINGUISHERS

All boats must have at least the minimum number of USCG-approved fire extinguishers of the capacity and type required by regulations; see this page.

Seals and tamper indicators must not be broken or damaged. Pressure gauges or indicators must be in the operable range. There must be no obvious physical damage or deterioration, no clogged nozzles.

CO2 and other chemical-vapor-type extinguishers must be weighed and tagged by a recognized authority annually. Pressure gauges should be checked every six months. Manual controls for fixed systems must be located outside the space being protected.

All hand-portable extinguishers should be mounted, but this is not a requirement for award of the VSC decal.

###### VENTILATION

The VSC examiner will check that the boat meets the Coast Guard requirements for manual and powered ventilation of spaces where explosive vapors might collect; see Chapter 3. All such spaces must be opened for examination; there must be no evidence of any fuel leaks.

Ducts and openings must not be blocked; blowers must be operational.

On boats built after 31 July, 1980, the manufacturer’s Certificate of Compliance will be accepted as proof that the ventilation system is properly designed and installed provided that it does not appear to have been altered and has been adequately maintained.

###### BACKFIRE FLAME CONTROL

Every boat with a gasoline engine installed, except outboard motors, must be equipped with an acceptable means of backfire flame control. Fuel-injected engines must have such a flame arrester over the air intake. In both cases, the device must be attached with a flame-tight connector. The approval number must be clearly visible.

###### SOUND-PRODUCING DEVICE

To receive the VSC decal, a boat must meet the legal requirements for a “sound-producing device.”

A craft 12 meters (39.4 ft) or more in length must have on board a horn or whistle (“athletic whistles” are not acceptable).

A boat less than 12 meters (39.4 ft) in length need not have the above devices, but must have “an efficient sound-signaling device.” This may be a whistle, horn, or other means to signal their intentions and/or position in periods of reduced visibility—athletic whistles are acceptable.

###### NAVIGATION LIGHTS

Boats 16 feet (4.9 m) or more in length must be capable of displaying underway and anchor lights. Boats less than 16 feet in length are not required to have lights to receive a decal, but if lights are installed, they must work properly. A sailboat with an auxiliary engine must be capable of showing the lights of both a sailboat and a powerboat; the lights must be wired so that they can be changed from one display to the other.

Cracked or discolored lenses are not acceptable. The decal will not be awarded if lights are grossly misplaced, even if they are operable. Navigation lights must show unbroken light through the prescribed arcs of visibility. All-around lights may not be obstructed for more than six degerees by items such as collapsible canopies, Bimini tops, masts, and similar items.

###### POLLUTION PLACARDS

A boat 26 feet (7.9 m) or more in length with a machinery compartment must have an “oily waste pollution” placard no smaller than 5 by 8 inches (13 x 20 cm) and made of a durable material, posted in the machinery space or where the bilge pump switch is located. Boats of this length must also display a 4 x 9-inch (10 x 22.5 cm) “MARPOL” waste placard (garbage dumping restrictions) “in a prominent location.” Craft 40 feet (12.2 m) and over equipped with a galley and berthing must have a written Waste Management Plan describing the procedures for collecting, processing, storing, and discharging of garbage. The plan must designate the person in charge of carrying out the plan; see this page.

###### MARINE SANITATION DEVICE

Any installed MSD must be a Coast Guard-approved device. Overboard discharge outlets must be capable of being sealed. Special local or state restrictions may apply.

###### OVERALL BOAT CONDITION

The boat must be free from fire hazards and in good overall condition, with bilges reasonably clean and visible hull structure generally sound. The use of automobile parts on boat engines is not acceptable. The engine horsepower must not exceed that shown on any capacity plate.

The electrical system must be protected by fuses or trip-free circuit breakers. Wiring must be in good condition, properly installed, with no exposed areas or deteriorated insulation. Batteries must be firmly secured with terminals covered or protected by a battery box cover.

Any self-circling or kill-switch mechanisms must be in proper working order. All personal watercraft (PWCs) must have a self-circling or kill-switch mechanism.

Portable fuel tanks (normally 7 gallons or less) must be of nonbreakable material and must be free of corrosion and leaks. All vents must be capable of being closed. The tank must be secured and have a vapor-tight, leak-proof cap. Each permanent fuel tank must be properly vented.

Galley stoves and heating systems must have fuel tanks that are properly secured with no flammable material nearby.

###### VSC RECOMMENDATIONS

The VSC program also recommends a number of items for the safety and proper operation of a boat—items beyond those required for award of the decal. The actual selection of items from this list will depend on the size and use of the boat involved; the VSC examiner will make recommendations and suggestions. The VSC list includes the following items:

Marine radio

Dewatering device and backup (scoop or bilge pump)

Mounted fire extinguishers in appropriate locations

Anchor and line, suitable for area

First-aid kit

Person-in-the-water kit (one extra wearable PFD and a throwable device with line attached)

Visual distress signals for inland boating

VSC examiners may also discuss operational and educational matters in the interest of increased safety. Topics might include:

Accident reporting

Operator responsibilities

Offshore operations

Charts and aids to navigation

First-aid and survival tips

Fueling and fuel management

Float plans

Insurance consideration

Boating checklists

Safe-boating classes

Additional information on the VSC program is available on the Internet at americasboatingclub.org or www.cgaux.org.

###### A FINAL WORD ON FIRE EXTINGUISHERS

When it comes to equipping your boat with fire extinguishers, it is prudent to go beyond even the VSC requirements. Consider installing extinguishers in the following locations, or wherever else you deem necessary to meet the needs of your boat:

The helm, where there is always someone when underway

The engine space or room

The galley

In each cabin or compartment and adjacent to the skipper’s bunk.

#### Refrigeration

Ice is used on some boats as a means of keeping food fresh and for cooling beverages. It offers no safety hazards, but water from melting ice should be piped overboard rather than into the bilge; a fresh-water drip tends to promote rot and/or odor. A collection sump, with pump, may be used, but is less desirable.

Mechanical refrigeration is normally of the electric-motor-driven compressor type using 12 VDC or 120 VAC power. On some boats a compressor is belt-driven from a main engine.

Safety aspects of mechanical refrigeration include use of a nontoxic and nonflammable refrigerant, nonsparking motors, safety valves on high-pressure portions of the system, and general construction adequate to survive the rigors of marine service.

Kerosene and propane “gas” refrigerators operate with a constant open flame and must be maintained in a precisely level position at all times. They are not suitable for use on a boat, and their use may void the boat’s insurance policy.

#### Heaters

Gasoline-fueled heaters must never be used on a boat. Portable kerosene or alcohol-fueled heaters pose a threat of CO poisoning and fire and are not recommended. Fixed-mount, externally vented diesel heaters may be used. Built-in electrical heaters are safe; portable electrical heaters should be used only if secured in place while in operation.

Any heater discharging combustion products must be vented through a stovepipe and a “charley noble” set in a water-cooled deck plate or other fire-preventive fitting. Many sailors favor coal- or charcoal-burning heaters, despite the mess they create and the problems of storing fuel, because of the even, dry heat that they deliver.

LPG (propane) heaters should have an automatic device to shut off the fuel supply if the flame is extinguished; pilot lights should not be used.

Many models of air-conditioning equipment used on boats are of the “reverse cycle” or “heat pump” type and can supply warmth rather than cooling when needed, provided that the surrounding water is not too cold. This is a thoroughly safe heating method.

## MAINTENANCE FOR SAFETY

No matter what item of equipment is placed on board to enhance safety, it must be properly maintained to ensure continuous safety. Continual attention is needed for some safety gear; for others, periodic checks at weekly, monthly, or annual intervals is sufficient. The important thing is that these checks of safety equipment be made regularly when needed; use of a checklist is strongly recommended; see Figure 11-23.

Figure 11-23 When inspecting any system on a boat, use a checklist so that nothing is overlooked. When you are finished, be sure to follow up and correct any deficiencies that are found.

#### Keep Your Boat Clean

Cleanliness is an important aspect of safety. Accumulations of dirt and trash in the bilge will soak up oil and fuel drippings and become a fire hazard. Such accumulations may also stop up limber holes and clog bilge pumps. Keep your bilge absolutely free of dirt and trash; check frequently and clean out as often as needed.

### Lifesaving Equipment

The maintenance of PFDs is covered in Chapter 3—make sure that these actions are listed on your safety maintenance checklist. Do not delay in replacing below-par lifesaving devices; attempt repairs only where full effectiveness can be restored. In case of doubt, ask the Coast Guard.

If you have a life raft on board, ensure that it receives the required periodic inspections at an authorized service facility at the intervals specified by the manufacturer.

### Fire Extinguishers

Installed fire-extinguishing systems should be checked at least annually, more often if recommended by the manufacturer, whose maintenance procedures should be followed. An excellent procedure is to inspect at the beginning of the year’s boating activities, and again at mid-season. ABYC Standard A-4 recommends that portable extinguishers be checked at least monthly.

#### Dry-Chemical Extinguishers

Pressurized dry-chemical extinguishers have a gauge that should be checked for an indication of adequate pressure—the needle in the center of the green area of the scale. Do not, however, merely read the gauge; tap it lightly to make sure it is not stuck at a safe indication. If it drops to a lower reading, take the extinguisher to a service shop for recharging. Even if the gauge reads OK, take the unit out of its bracket, invert it, and shake it a bit to loosen the dry chemical inside to keep it from settling and hardening; the natural tendency to pack is increased by the motions and vibrations on a boat. If the contents of the extinguisher become tightly packed, some of it may not be discharged when the unit is used, and its fire-fighting effectiveness would be reduced.

Any areas on the exterior of the cylinder showing rust should be cleaned and repainted. Do not test by triggering a short burst of powder. The valve probably will not reseat fully, and the pressure will slowly leak off.

Most dry-chemical stored pressure extinguishers of less than 2.75-pound size are considered disposable and should be replaced if the pressure gauge reading is low. Larger, refillable extinguishers must be serviced in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.

#### CO2 Extinguishers

Carbon-dioxide extinguishers must be checked annually by weight. Any seals on the valve trigger must be unbroken. Portable units and built-in systems have a weight stamped at the valve. If the total weight is down by 10 percent or more of the net weight of the contents, the cylinder must be recharged. The gauge of these units may indicate almost the full amount of pressure even if the cylinder is nearly empty of the extinguishing agent. Weighing is normally the only check for CO2 fire extinguishers, but it must be done accurately. Portable units can be checked by the skipper if he has suitably precise and accurate scales. Built-in systems are best checked by a professional serviceperson who has special knowledge and equipment.

CO2 cylinders also should display the date on which the cylinder was last hydrostatically pressure-tested. (This is done by emptying the cylinder of its extinguishing agent, then filling it with water and increasing the pressure to a value significantly greater than the working pressure; this testing will require a commercial facility.) Testing should be done every five years if the cylinder is not discharged. If the extinguisher is used, it must be pressure-tested before it is recharged if this has not been done within the preceding five years. If a used CO2 extinguisher is purchased, it should be discharged, hydrostatically tested, and recharged before it is installed aboard. The pressure in these cylinders is tremendous, and if the cylinder has been damaged through rust or corrosion, it is just like a time bomb, and you do not know when it may go off!

Carbon-dioxide extinguishers should not be installed where bilge or rainwater will collect and cause rust. Any exposed metal should be painted at each annual inspection. If a cylinder becomes pitted from rust, have it hydrostatically tested for safety. Replace any damaged hoses or horns on this type of extinguisher.

#### Other Chemical-Vapor Extinguishers

Pressure gauges on automatic systems using FE-241, HFC-227ea, or FM-200 and the like must be checked at 6-month intervals (a daily check is suggested by some manufacturers) and the cylinder weighed annually (NFPA 2001 6.1) using a scale of known accuracy capable of reading weight differences of less than one ounce. These extinguishers must be hydrostatically pressure-tested at 12-year intervals. (Halon is no longer manufactured, and Halon extinguishers are disappearing, as mentioned in Chapter 3.)

#### Periodic Discharges

It is a good policy to discharge a fire extinguisher periodically even though it is not needed for fighting a fire. An effective way of doing this would be to discharge one of the portable units each year on a regular rotation basis. This should be done in the presence of the whole crew and, as discussed earlier, preferably in the form of a drill, putting out a small fire—off the boat, of course—in a metal pan or tub. Probably 99 percent or more of all persons who go boating have never discharged a fire extinguisher, let alone used one to put out a fire. There is no time to read the instructions carefully and practice after a fire has started on your boat. A word of warning with respect to CO2 extinguishers: Never unscrew the hose from the cylinder and then discharge it openly; always hold the nozzle by its thermally-insulated handle.

Make sure that fire extinguishers are serviced by a competent shop and reinstalled as soon as possible after being removed for testing or practice discharge. It is wise not to strip your boat of fire protection by removing all extinguishers at the same time for servicing; do a half or a third at a time.

#### Log Entries

Make an entry in the boat’s log of all inspections, tests, and servicing of fire extinguishers. This will help keep these essential checks from being overlooked and may prove valuable in the event of insurance surveys or claims.

### Engine & Fuel System

Check the engine and fuel system frequently for cleanliness and leaks. Wipe up any oil or grease drippings and stop leaks as soon as possible. Take immediate action in the case of any gasoline leaks. Do not use the boat, and disconnect the leads from the battery (with all loads turned off so that no spark will jump) so that the engine cannot be started.

Check the entire fuel system annually inch by inch, including fuel lines in areas not normally visible. Look for any evidence of seepage of fuel or external corrosion of the lines. If any suspicious joints or lengths of tubing or hose are found, call in a qualified mechanic without delay.

#### Bilge Ventilation System

Although it is the manufacturer’s responsibility to install a powered ventilation system on certain types of boats, it is the operator’s responsibility to ensure that the system continues to perform properly (and to use it!). Even if yours is an older boat, built before these requirements came into effect, maintain your bilge ventilation system in top operating condition.

#### Carbon-Monoxide Detectors

If your boat is equipped with a carbon-monoxide (CO) detector—and it should be—its proper operation must be checked periodically at the intervals and in the manner prescribed in its owner’s manual. You must be sure it will function if needed—it could save your life and the lives of others on board. While you must consider all alarm activations to be caused by CO, many of these detectors will sound an alarm if they detect the presence of hydrogen gas emitted at the end of a lead-acid battery charging cycle.

### Electrical Systems

A boat’s electrical system should be inspected thoroughly every year, including all wiring in areas not normally visible. This should be done by a person qualified to evaluate what he finds: by you if you have the necessary knowledge and experience, or by an outside expert if needed.

Search for any cut or chafed insulation, corrosion at connections, excessive sag or strain on conductors, and other visible signs of deterioration. A leakage test should be made by opening each circuit at the main distribution panel and measuring current flow when all loads are turned off. Ideally there should be no current flow; current of more than a few milliamperes indicates electrical “leakage” that should be tracked down and corrected without delay.

Maintenance of storage batteries is covered in Chapter 19.

#### Bonding Systems

If all through-hull fittings, struts, shafts, etc., are electrically connected by an internal bonding system (see Chapter 19), this wiring should be checked annually. Especially careful checks should be made where connections are made to the protected fitting or other metal part. Connections in the bilge are subject to corrosion and development of poor contacts with high electrical resistance.

The skipper can make a visual check of the bonding system, but an electrical expert with specialized equipment is needed for a thorough evaluation. Should any signs of corrosion at points of connection between bonding wires and through-hull fittings be noted, a complete electrical test is recommended.

With respect to possible electrolysis (stray current corrosion) damage, a bonding system with one or more poor connections may be worse than no system at all. Electrolysis can and does cause weakening of through-hull fittings, bolts on struts and rudderposts, etc., that could result in serious safety hazards.

### Hull Safety Maintenance

Boats normally kept in the water should be hauled out periodically for bottom cleaning and repainting. This occasion provides an opportunity for a safety inspection of hull and fittings below the waterline. On wood boats, check hull planking for physical damage and for any general deterioration from age. Check fiberglass hulls for any cracks, especially at points of high stress. Call in an expert if you find any suspicious areas.

#### Through-Hull Fittings

Operate seacocks once a month to ensure that they will remain easily movable. Check carefully for signs of leakage, deterioration of hoses, and corrosion of hose clamps. Clean out through-hull fittings, and clean and lubricate seacocks at the annual haul-out. Check that a closed seacock totally blocks the flow of water.

#### Underwater Components

Check underwater fittings annually. This includes shafts, propellers, rudders, struts, bearings, stuffing boxes, and metal skegs. Stuffing boxes should be repacked as often as necessary to keep them from leaking excessively. Shafts should be checked for alignment and excessive wear at strut bearings, and propellers examined to see if they need truing up.

Each “zinc”—galvanic corrosion protector—should be checked quarterly and replaced if more than half has eroded away.

### Follow-up of Inspections

Nothing is gained if prompt and thorough follow-up actions are not taken on findings of periodic safety inspections. Maintenance related to safety must not be delayed. Do not operate a boat that has a known safety defect.

## SAFETY IN THE WATER

Anyone who goes boating regularly should know how to care for himself in the water. Fortunately, most boaters and their families do know how to swim, but this may be limited to taking a few strokes in a calm, relatively warm pool, with safety and rest only a few feet away. Give special attention to staying afloat under adverse conditions of water temperature and waves. Seldom is it necessary or even desirable to swim any distance; the challenge is to stay afloat until help arrives. The skipper and crew should all have instructions in “drown-proofing.”

Safety in the water can well start with a swimming and/or lifesaving class at the local “Y” or community recreational center. Local American Red Cross chapters may give instruction in these subjects.

#### Lifesaving Devices

A person in the water following a boating accident should, of course, have a lifesaving device of some sort—a life jacket or a buoyant cushion. It is important that these devices be worn or used properly. Buoyant cushions are far from the best flotation device, but are widely used because of their convenience and low cost. Buoyant cushions are not intended to be worn. The straps on a buoyant cushion are put there for holding-on purposes and also to aid in throwing the device. Because they must be grasped, cushions are not suitable for small children or injured persons and are not desirable for nonswimmers. Cushions should never be worn on a person’s back, since this tends to force his face down in the water.

Type I life jackets with flotation material in sealed plastic pouches provide the greatest safety. Stow life jackets in several locations about the boat, so fire or other disaster cannot cut you off from all of them; they must also be easily accessible. Everyone on board, including guests, must know where the life jackets are stowed. You and your regular crew should have tried them on and should be able to get into them quickly even in the dark (practice while wearing a blindfold). Most importantly, order everyone into life jackets in advance of their need, if you can. Wearing a comfortable inflatable life jacket will provide a constant and valuable safety enhancement. At night, anyone on deck should routinely wear a life jacket; nonswimmers, young children, and persons physically handicapped or with a cast on an arm or leg should wear one at all times when not below decks.

Never carry on your boat any nonapproved, damaged, or condemned lifesaving devices as “extras”—someone might grab one of them in an emergency.

##### CPR AND RESCUE BREATHING

As a skipper, you should take the time to secure first-aid and CPR training from The American Heart Association, American National Red Cross, National Safety Council, American Safety & Health Institute, or Medic First Aid. Each of these agencies offers training guidelines that are revised every five years.

Should someone on your vessel collapse or sustain serious injury, the first priority while administering immediate life-saving intervention is to radio for help. Use your radio to make a Mayday call to request assistance and briefly describe your onboard emergency.

When someone collapses and does not appear to be breathing—or is gasping—assume cardiac arrest has occurred; do not delay intervention. Previous guidelines called for an initial check for responsiveness, but the 2010 guidelines dispense with this in favor of immediate intervention. If you have a defibrillator on board (see below), have someone get it after initiating the Mayday call. If you do not have a defibrillator on board or are waiting for it to be deployed, immediately begin CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) as in illustrations #1 and #2.

1 Unless the victim is obviously conscious with a suspected serious injury to his or her neck, place one hand on the victim’s hip and the other on his shoulder to roll him onto his back as shown. As the victim begins to roll, move your upper hand from the shoulder to the head so that it is supported as you complete the rotation.

2 To perform CPR chest compressions, place your hands in the middle of the victim’s chest and begin to press hard and press fast. Compressions should be given at a minimum of 100 times per minute and to a depth of 2 inches, allowing the chest to recoil after each compression. The key to good CPR is to avoid any unnecessary delays in compressions.

If you or someone on board is a health-care provider, the CPR procedure will be slightly modified by the delivery of two rescue breaths every 30 compressions, as in illustrations #3 and #4. In addition, if the health-care provider determines that the victim has a palpable pulse but is still not breathing, one rescue breath will be delivered every 5 or 6 seconds, and the pulse will be re-checked every two minutes as in illustration #5. If the victim becomes pulseless at any time, CPR should be resumed immediately.

3 Rescue breathing was the primary recommended CPR method prior to 2010 but is now considered a secondary adjunct to chest compressions. Before performing rescue breathing, tilt the victim’s head back slightly—using a head-tilt/chin-lift action as shown by the arrows—so that the back of the tongue does not block the airway.

4 Pinch the victim’s nostrils closed as shown. Place your mouth over the victim’s mouth and deliver a full breath so that you can see the victim’s chest rise. Allow the victim to exhale after each such breath.

5 To check a pulse, place your fingertips to the side of the victim’s trachea; to do this, locate the Adam’s apple, then slide your fingers into the groove on the side of the neck. Applying gentle pressure, feel for a pulse as shown for 5 to 10 seconds.

If the victim vomits or you must leave an unconscious person, roll him or her onto his or her side and clear the mouth and throat. Stabilize the person by bending his or her upper leg at the hip and knee. Raise the victim’s head slightly, extend the lower arm straight out under it, and gently lower the head until the extended arm supports it.

Cardiac arrest in children is a rarity, but respiratory arrest or drowning can occur. The procedures for delivering rescue breathing and CPR to children and infants are different than for adults, which is another good reason why a prudent skipper should secure training in CPR and first aid.

If you or any regular crewmember has a history of cardiac disease or could be prone to a cardiac condition, consider purchasing an automated external defibrillator (AED). The cost of an AED in 2012 ranged from $1,200 to $1,500. During CPR, while compressions are underway, apply the pads supplied with the AED to the victim and follow the instructions delivered by voice prompts from the AED. If the AED does not recommend shocking the victim, resume chest compressions for two minutes before checking the rhythm again with the AED. If a victim has had a return of pulses but becomes pulseless with the AED in place, resume chest compressions at a rate of 100 compressions per minute.

#### Swimming Tips

Even with the best lifesaving equipment aboard, you may find yourself in the water without the aid of a buoyant device or approved PFD. If your boat stays afloat or awash, stay with it. Search vessels and aircraft can spot a boat or its wreckage far more easily than an individual whose head only is above water.

While swimming you may find temporary relief from fatigue by floating or by varying your style of swimming. Cold or tired muscles are susceptible to cramps. A leg cramp can often be overcome by moving your knees up toward your chest so that you can massage the affected area. Save your breath as much as possible; call for help only when there is someone close enough to hear you.

## FIRST AID AFLOAT

At the beginning of this chapter we considered certain responsibilities of the skipper. Another of these is caring for minor injuries and illnesses of his crew and guests. Your boat should have at least simple first-aid supplies and equipment, plus a manual of instructions for their use; you should have had basic first-aid instruction and CPR training.

But no one who is not educated and properly qualified to practice medicine should attempt to act as a doctor. There are, however, many instances where the availability of a first-aid kit (see this page), some knowledge on the part of the boater, and a ready reference book have materially eased pain or even saved the life of a sick or injured person on a boat. All skippers should be prepared to render emergency first aid, doing no more than is absolutely necessary while getting the victim to a doctor or hospital as rapidly as possible.

##### WATER SAFETY TIPS

• Know your personal limits; avoid overextending yourself.

• Always swim with at least two other persons, never alone.

• Before diving, make sure that the water is deep enough and hazard-free; check for any change in tide level since last swimming. For the first dive, enter the water feet-first.

• When tired or overheated, stay out of the water.

• Rely on your swimming ability for support, not on inflatable or inherently buoyant objects, such as plastic toys or air-mattress rafts.

• If you are a nonswimmer, do not go into the water without a life jacket.

• Avoid carbon monoxide danger; never be in the water at the stern of a boat when an engine or genset is running.

### Responding Quickly to Medical Emergencies

On land, emergency medical assistance is usually just moments away. But on the water, you are on your own—at least for a longer period of time. As skipper of a boat, you are responsible for dealing with medical emergencies aboard, an obligation that relies on formal first-aid training and stocking the necessary supplies. It also means knowing the physical condition and any medical problems of everyone aboard your boat.

Your confidence and competence in handling medical emergencies should be on a par with your seamanship skills. That level of confidence comes from knowledge and practice; both can be acquired and honed by basic and advanced first-aid courses. Perhaps most important, you learn to stay calm in emergencies because you know what to do; see Figure 11-24. You can then make decisions and take the appropriate steps to keep a victim alive or to keep injuries stabilized until you can obtain emergency medical service.

Figure 11-24 As you first take immediate action in a medical emergency, check the victim for a medical information bracelet or pendant, which will bear an insignia resembling this one. This may provide vital information about a diagnosed medical condition, allergy, sensitivity, or prescribed medication.

Don’t neglect or delay first aid for minor cuts and scrapes; avoid possible infection. Apply an antiseptic and a bit of antibiotic cream or jelly (Neosporin, Polysporin, or equivalent); cover with a clean bandage if necessary. If there is reluctance on the part of the victim to receive first aid, the skipper must insist on prompt and adequate treatment.

### Your Legal Responsibility

Legally, a victim must give consent before a person trained in first aid begins to help him or her. The law assumes that an unconscious person would give consent. If a victim is conscious, make sure you ask permission before administering first aid. If you are helping a victim previously unknown to you, ask a simple question: “My name is…I know first aid and I can help you until emergency assistance arrives; is that all right?”

You must be aware that emergencies in which the victim is an infant or child younger than eight years old may require special training and similar but varied techniques than for an adult or a child eight years or older. If you are likely to have infants or children under eight aboard your boat frequently, you should enroll in a first-aid course that specializes in first-aid techniques for that age group.

### Calling for Emergency Help

In any medical emergency, it is essential to make sure that help is on the way—soon rather than too late. Even when in doubt about the severity of the victim’s condition, save precious seconds by immediately sending an urgent call using “Pan-Pan” (see Chapter 12). Remember the old adage that it’s better to be safe than sorry; you can always cancel the call if you get the situation under control.

There is the possibility that help will come from boats in the immediate vicinity. Until help arrives, take whatever first-aid measures you are qualified to perform. You usually can make contact with a doctor through the Coast Guard. Make a VHF/DSC Mayday and Ch 16 voice call or an HF call on 2182 kHz (DSC 2187.5 kHz). The USCG has access to military and U.S. Public Health physicians and, through its AMVER (Automated Mutual-Assistance Vessel Rescue) system, keeps track of ships at sea that have medical staff aboard. If you cannot reach the USCG, there are private companies that provide emergency medical services to ships at sea. One of these is MedAire, Inc., of Phoenix, AZ (480-333-3700; www.medaire.com), which can give immediate, real-time medical assistance to people in remote locations 24 hours a day, seven days a week from its response centers around the world. MedAire offers the expertise of emergency physicians, flight nurses, and paramedics and a database of medical providers, including 15,000 hospitals and clinics in more than 5,000 cities around the world; it specializes in the hospitalization, transportation, and evacuation of patients as needed.

# CHAPTER12

Figure 12-01 As a basic action toward preventing an emergency from arising, every boat should be well maintained and have proper safety equipment, such as personal flotation devices (PFDs). Capsizings and falls overboard are responsible for almost two-thirds of boating fatalities.

EMERGENCIES UNDERWAY

Preparing for Emergencies • Summoning Assistance • Collisions Flooding • Fires & Explosions • Man Overboard • Other Emergencies Helicopter Rescue • Abandoning Ship

Whether caused by rough weather, over-confidence or just plain carelessness, emergencies on board a boat are the greatest test of a skipper’s abilities. How quickly he or she can react to and minimize the effects of an accident, fire, or other crisis on board can often make the difference between mishap and disaster, or even between life and death.

This chapter deals with preparing for potentially serious situations—flooding, fires and explosions, man overboard, and others—and dealing with them should they occur. Less serious “everyday” emergencies—heavy weather, fog and reduced visibility from other causes, running aground, assisting other vessels in trouble, and towing and being towed—are considered special seamanship situations and are covered in Chapter 10. The medical aspects of emergency situations are covered in Chapter 11, this page.

This chapter also explains how to call for help when you need it and how to cope with helicopter rescue and abandon-ship emergencies.

## PREPARING FOR EMERGENCIES

Experienced skippers prepare themselves for dealing with emergencies as a matter of routine. They also prepare their crews. Whether the crewmembers are part of a competitive team, or family and friends, or guests out for a casual afternoon cruise, the seasoned skipper is prepared for any dangers that may present a threat to the safety of the craft and those on board. The location of emergency equipment—fire extinguishers, personal flotation devices, radio, visual distress signals, etc.—should be shown to everyone on board.

The first thought to be given to any preparation for a specific emergency should be how to prevent that situation from ever arising. Begin by ensuring that the boat is properly equipped and maintained. The emergencies that are most often reported as accidents, listed in the sidebar “Boating Accidents,” can usually be prevented by the actions described in Chapter 11, Safety Afloat. The practice of good seamanship is an essential element in the elimination of emergencies; safe operating procedures for various types of boats are covered in Chapters 6, 7, and 8.

##### BOATING ACCIDENTS

According to USCG statistics on 27,435 reported boating accidents during a recent five-year period, the following thirteen causes are cited, in order of frequency of occurrence. The consequences were serious: 3,507 fatalities, 19,038 injuries, and more than $185 million in property damage. Although each type of accident resulted in some fatalities, those indicated with an asterisk were responsible for approximately 90 percent of total fatalities.

• Collision with other vessels.*

• Collision with a fixed object.*

• Capsizing.*

• Other casualty; unknown.*

• Falls overboard.*

• Grounding.*

• Fire or explosion of fuel.

• Collision with floating object.

• Swamping/flooding.

• Sinking.

• Struck by boat or propeller.

• Falls within boat.

• Non-fuel-related fire or explosion.

The U.S. Coast Guard statistics do not include every accident to a recreational boat. Some are not included as no report is required; others go unreported due to ignorance of the requirement and a lack of enforcement of the law. The Coast Guard believes that “only a small portion of all boating accidents are reported.” The more serious the accident, the greater the likelihood of its being reported; it is probable that nearly all fatal accidents are reported.

### The Importance of Emergency Drills

The general importance of practice and drills was pointed out in Chapter 11; this is even more important in relation to the preparation for emergencies. Even the best plans are valuable only if tried out and evaluated, revised as necessary, and then practiced periodically. Rehearse the procedures discussed in this chapter until they are second nature. Practice each operation with the entire crew at the beginning of each boating season, then once again on a staggered schedule later in the season. Make every effort to keep the drills enjoyable without reducing their serious nature. Have some drills without your participation, as if you had become incapacitated.

Think of invited guests as “temporary crew.” You may not be able to train them in drills, but they should be shown where the life jackets are and how to use them. Inform them in a relaxed manner, not with an air of alarm. If guests are aboard for an extended cruise, expand their knowledge to such items as the location and use of fire extinguishers and bilge pumps.

##### TRANSMITTING A DSC AND VOICE MAYDAY DISTRESS CALL

A MAYDAY call on a marine radio is the most effective way to summon aid when faced with grave and imminent danger. Regardless of your location, use your VHF/DSC radio to send a DSC MAYDAY call (if linked to a GPS receiver, it will automatically alert every DSC-equipped vessel and coast station in radio range, instantly informing them of your precise position). Follow up with a voice MAYDAY call on channel 16 to alert stations in range that may not have DSC receiving capability. If offshore, follow up with voice distress calls on 2182 and the HF calling channels.

To make a DSC distress call:

1 Be sure the radio and GPS are ON.

2 Locate the red DISTRESS button.

3 Lift the cover and press and hold the button until the radio “beeps.”

4 After the radio beeps, pick up the microphone and make a voice MAYDAY call on channel 16, clearly saying, “MAYDAY, MAYDAY, MAYDAY.”

5 State your latitude and longitude or describe your location relative to a landmark or aid to navigation.

6 State the nature of your distress: medical, flooding, sinking, fire, etc.

7 Listen for a response from the Coast Guard on channel 16 and follow their instructions.

8 If you called on an MF or HF frequency (see this page), state the frequency you used.

## SUMMONING ASSISTANCE

The marine environment can be unforgiving, and what may initially be a minor problem can rapidly develop into a situation beyond your control. For this reason, let someone know when you are experiencing even relatively minor difficulties—before your situation turns into an emergency.

The USCG serves as Search and Rescue (SAR) coordinator for all maritime emergencies in U.S. waters and is the appropriate contact on safety issues. If you are in “distress”—if you and/or your boat are threatened by grave or imminent danger requiring immediate assistance—the USCG will take immediate action. Increasingly, though, help for situations less than an emergency will be provided by commercial assistance operators for a fee. There will, however, be instances where speed of response or lack of commercial towing craft will result in the use of USCG or USCG Auxiliary assistance.

Broadcasting a Mayday call is the most effective way to inform the outside world of your need for emergency assistance. The area over which your call will be heard largely depends on which of the three internationally coordinated systems you use: VHF/DSC Distress, a call on one of the MF or HF emergency frequencies, or an emergency beacon transmission on 406 MHz. Vessels in coastal waters (within 25 to perhaps 50 nautical miles from shore) should make their initial call using the Digital Selective Calling (DSC) distress feature of their VHF/DSC radio, followed up with a voice Mayday call on channel 16. Vessels beyond normal VHF range of coast stations should make a DSC Mayday call to alert all vessels in range and, in addition, a voice Mayday call on 2182 kHz or on one of the HF frequencies. The vessel’s 406 Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB) or Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) should be activated at the same time the VHF or MF/HF calls are made.

If your situation does not justify sending a Mayday call, you may wish to transmit an URGENCY–PAN–PAN call to alert all listening stations to stand by for your voice message. The most conspicuous way to send a PAN-PAN call is by using the DSC All Ships function, followed by your voice message on channel 16.

##### TRANSMITTING A PAN-PAN URGENCY CALL & MESSAGE

Send the Pan-Pan urgency signal to indicate that you have a “very urgent” message regarding the safety of your vessel or the safety of a person.

1 On channel 16, press the microphone button and say “PAN-PAN” (pronounced pahn-pahn) three times.

2 “ALL STATIONS (or the name of a particular vessel).”

3 “THIS IS (boat name)…(boat name)…(boat name).”

4 “WE (nature of your emergency).”

5 “WE REQUIRE (type of assistance required or other useful information such as your position, a description of your vessel, and/or the number of people on board).”

6 “THIS IS (boat name). OVER.”

##### CANCELING A PAN-PAN

If you transmit a Distress or Pan-Pan call, then find that you no longer require assistance, you must cancel the message on channel 16.

1 Say (as appropriate) “DISTRESS” or “PAN-PAN” three times.

2 “HELLO ALL STATIONS” three times.

3 “THIS IS (boat name).”

4 “TIME (use 24-hour clock).”

5 “CANCEL” (as appropriate) “DISTRESS” or “PAN-PAN.”

6 To cancel a DSC distress call that has not yet been answered by the Coast Guard; turn the radio off, then turn it back on, select channel 16 and make a voice broadcast per steps 1-5 above. Continue to monitor channel 16.

### How to Signal Distress & Urgency

Aboard most boats, the radio is the primary means for getting assistance. (For information on radio operation, see Chapter 20.) Channel 16 VHF is monitored by USCG stations and vessels, commercial shipping, and many recreational craft. Never rely on a cell phone for distress calls, but if service is available you may wish to call 911 if you have no other radio communication device.

Offshore farther than about 20 nautical miles (37 km), you should call the USCG on 4.125 or 6.215 MHz. (See also this page. Some Coast Guard stations monitor 2182 kHz.)

The Coast Guard’s Rescue 21 communication system provides VHF/DSC radio communication coverage of vast areas of coastal waters out to approximately 25 nautical miles (assuming a 1-watt transmitter with an antenna 5 feet [1.5 m] above the surface) and over longer distances in many instances. Most Rescue 21 stations are equipped with multiple antennas with direction-finding capability. In addition, the system is optimized to receive and automatically process calls made using vhf digital selective calling (vhf/dsc) to provide immediate and effective response to a distress call. Rescue 21 service was operational along the entire Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts of the continental United States, the Great Lakes, Hawaii, Alaska, the Western Rivers, and several U.S. territories as of 2018.

Time is critical in any search-and-rescue effort. A Mayday call using a properly installed VHF/DSC radio will cause every VHF/DSC radio in range of your vessel to emit an alarm sound and automatically log your call, including your latitude and longitude. The Rescue 21 system operator will see your vessel’s precise position on a chart. Your unique maritime mobile service identity number (mmsi) will be displayed and will be used to access the information about your vessel stored in the Coast Guard database, including the name and description of your vessel plus other information that will assist the Coast Guard in providing the assistance you need. The procedure for making an effective Mayday call is shown in the sidebar on this page.

### Radio Silence

“Seelonce (French pronunciation of ‘silence’) Mayday” has been adopted internationally to control transmissions on the distress frequency, telling all other stations to stop transmitting and maintain radio silence. This signal is to be used only by the unit in distress or the station controlling the distress traffic. Any other station that considers it necessary to advise one or more stations of the need to keep off the air should use the signal “Seelonce Distress” followed by its identification.

The signal to indicate the end of radio silence and permission to resume normal operation is “Seelonce Feenee” (French for “silence ended”) or “Prudonce” (French for “prudence”). This signal may be transmitted only by the station that has controlled the distress traffic.

### If You Hear a Mayday Call

If you are not in distress but you hear a Mayday call, listen carefully—do not transmit. As you listen, try to determine if your boat is in the best position to take the necessary action.

If yours is the logical boat to render assistance, reply with a call to the distressed vessel as follows: “(Name of boat in distress)…(name of boat in distress)…(name of boat in distress). This is (your boat name)…(your boat name)…(your boat name and call sign). Received Mayday.”

When the other vessel has acknowledged your call, continue with your offer of assistance by giving your position, your speed toward the scene of distress, and the estimated time to get there. But be sure before you transmit that you will not be interfering with the signal of another vessel better situated to render immediate assistance. Keep in mind that the “Good Samaritan” provision (see Chapter 2) protects you from liability.

If yours is not the logical boat to take action, maintain radio silence but monitor the frequency closely for any further development. Start making notes so that you can record the events in your boat’s log. When another station retransmits a distress message, the words “Mayday Relay” must be spoken three times before station identification.

### Making a Non-Distress Emergency Call

If your situation is not a distress, call one of the commercial, on-water assist service companies by hailing them on channel 16, with a DSC hailing call, using their MMSI (many towing companies have published their MMSIs for this purpose) or a cell or satellite phone if you know the number. If you are unaware of what services may be available, call the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard will normally coordinate the efforts to assist you and, if necessary, will make a Marine Assistance Request Broadcast (MARB) on your behalf, announcing your need for help, your position, and inviting others to come to your aid.

Thereafter, if you do not accept services offered in response to the first MARB, you have two options. The USCG will supply information about commercial firms, if available, so you may contact them directly. Or, if you request, the USCG will make a second MARB to see if other help is available.

Keep in contact with the Coast Guard at regular intervals and tell them when help arrives. If someone offers help but cannot get to you within a reasonable time, usually not to exceed one hour, contact the Coast Guard to arrange other assistance. In addition, inform the Coast Guard if conditions change sufficiently to cause alarm—for example, if a medical emergency develops, a storm approaches, your boat begins taking on water, or your last reported position changes. If the Coast Guard or Coast Guard Auxiliary arrives to assist you and you require a tow, they normally will tow you to the nearest location where you can arrange for repairs or a tow back to your homeport. However, if a commercial firm is available to help you safely in a reasonable time, the Coast Guard will not provide direct on-scene assistance. Since you will have to pay for the commercial firm’s services, inquire about fees and salvage commitments before accepting that service.

Remember that, if you agree to the assistance of a commercial firm and then refuse this service when it arrives, you still may be legally obligated to pay a fee.

In addition to Coast Guard and commercial firms, others that may be available to assist you include a fellow boater, a local fire or police department, or another public agency. Keep in mind that a Good Samaritan, although well-meaning, may not have the equipment or skills needed to help you safely and effectively.

### If You Do Not Have a Radio

If you do not have a marine radio, or yours is not working, attempt to signal a fellow boater who can either assist or call the Coast Guard for you. In a distress situation, use flares or any other distress signaling device to catch the attention of people aboard other boats in the vicinity. Refer to the officially recognized signals shown in Chapter 5; see Figure 5-20.

## COLLISIONS

Accident statistics for a recent year make very interesting reading. For all reported accidents involving recreational boats, 41 percent involved the collision of one craft with another, an additional 12 percent involved the collision of a boat with a fixed or floating object. Thus, collisions were the majority of all reported boating accidents. Clearly, collisions are a primary category of underway emergencies. With more boats using our waters every year and faster speeds becoming common, every skipper must learn to use special caution to avoid a collision; see Figure 12-02.

Figure 12-02 Many boating areas are relatively open expanses of water without specific channels. Craft may approach from one or more directions, often several at a time. To avoid collisions, every skipper must know who has the right-of-way and what signal to give in each situation.

##### USING A CELL PHONE TO GET HELP

The Coast Guard recommends that calls for assistance be made using a VHF radio whenever possible. A cell phone call cannot alert nearby vessels of your need for assistance. Transfer of a 911 call to the Coast Guard can significantly delay the arrival of assistance, and a dropped call may not be recoverable.

The only instance in which a cell phone should be used to notify authorities of an emergency is if it is the only means of communication, in which case the call should be made to 911.

### Avoiding Collisions

In recent years, among the most frequent causes of boating accidents were “operator inattention,” “no proper lookout,” and “operator carelessness.” If your course appears to be converging with another vessel’s, take careful compass or relative bearings every few minutes; increase their frequency as the gap narrows. If the bearings move forward, the other vessel will cross ahead of you; if the bearings move aft, the boat will cross behind you. But if the bearings remain constant, you are on a collision course and must take immediate action. Do not wait until the last moment. If the other vessel is a boat, take action in accordance with Navigation Rules, giving way or maintaining course and speed if you are the stand-on vessel.

Although a converging course is difficult to judge with any boat, large commercial vessels offer a real challenge. As soon as you spot a freighter, tanker, or ferry, assign a crewmember to lookout duty. Nothing should distract this person from looking at and taking bearings on the vessel until the chance of collision has clearly passed. Unless you are certain that you will cross its bow at least one mile ahead of it, alter your course so that you will pass astern of the larger vessel. If your boat is on a bow-to-bow reciprocal course with another vessel, temporarily alter course to starboard by at least 20 degrees.

Even if you are the stand-on vessel, the Navigation Rules (see Chapter 5) require you to do everything you can to avoid collision—even if it means reversing. If a collision seems imminent and the other vessel’s crew obviously doesn’t see you, do everything you can to make your boat visible.

Attract attention to your vessel by shining a bright hand-held light on your sails, or fire flares from your vessel to attract the other crew’s attention.

In summary, to be safe when encountering another vessel, you should:

• Know the Navigation Rules for the waters you are using.

• Obey the Navigation Rules.

• Assume that the operator of the other vessel does not know the Navigation Rules and will not be obeying them.

### If You Do Have a Collision

If despite your best effort a collision does occur, your first actions should be for the safety and welfare of persons on your boat and the other craft. If people are in the water, throw them life jackets or any other item that would help them remain afloat until they can be helped on board your or another craft. If there are injuries, apply such first-aid measures as you can; see Chapter 11.

As the statistics show, despite knowing the Rules of the Road and taking proper precautions, collisions do occur. If you are involved in one—your fault or the other skipper’s—you are in most instances required to file an accident report. In some instances, this report will be made to the Coast Guard on Form CG-3865. In most cases, however, the report will be made to a state agency using a form required by that agency; this form will usually be very similar to the Coast Guard form. The circumstances that require the submission of an accident report and the time requirements for its submission are shown in the sidebar above, see also Chapter 2, this page.

##### REPORTING BOATING ACCIDENTS

Boating Accident Reports are intended to assist the Coast Guard in determining the cause of accidents and making recommendations for their prevention, and in compiling appropriate statistics. In case of collision, accident, or other casualty involving a vessel subject to the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971 (FBSA/71), the operator must make a formal report within 48 hours if the incident results in any of the following circumstances:

• Death, although local authorities must be notified immediately.

• An injury requiring medical treatment beyond first aid.

• The disappearance of a person from a vessel under circumstances that indicate death or injury. The report must be filed within 10 days if the accident results in either property damage totaling more than $2,000 or in complete loss of a vessel. Most state boating laws require that reports of boating accidents be made to a designated state office or official. If, however, there is no state provision for reporting such incidents, a report must be made to the Coast Guard Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection, nearest the site of the accident.

Coast Guard regulations on accident reporting list the information that must be furnished. The Boating Accident Report Form—CG-3865—may be used in recreational boat reports to the Coast Guard; states normally use this form or one of their own patterned after it. (Note that reporting requirements and the form are different for craft in commercial operation.)

## FLOODING

Be prepared mentally and in terms of equipment to take immediate action at the first sign of water entering your boat. Try to identify where the water is coming in. If your boat is damaged by collision with another boat, or if you hit a submerged object, especially at high speed, the location of the leak will probably be obvious. In other situations, the source of the inflow may not be easy to determine.

A likely cause of leaks is failure of through-hull fittings and related parts such as hoses, keel bolts, underwater exhausts, stuffing boxes, and rudderposts; check these locations first. This is where a thorough knowledge of your boat is essential. If you have taken the time to diagram the location of every through-hull fitting in your boat, you will be well prepared to find the problem quickly and to deal with the situation in a calm, logical manner.

### Preparing in Advance for Leak Control

Even if you can’t prevent a leak, you can be well prepared to repair it with speed and confidence. The following precautions may help when your boat begins taking on water:

• Install the largest possible manually operated diaphragm pump; such units are available with a capacity of one gallon per stroke. Mount the pump so that you can operate it continuously without excessive fatigue.

• Have on board softwood plugs—one of appropriate diameter for each size of through-hull fitting in your boat, tapered so they can be driven into place from the inside; see Figure 12-03.

Figure 12-03 If the cause of the leak is a damaged hose, closing the seacock (above left) should solve the problem. If, however, a through-hull fitting fails and the seacock or gate valve cannot be closed, hammer in a plug to stop the inflow of water (above right). Such a plug must be watched closely lest it come out undetected.

• To prepare for the possibility of hull damage, stock a small, strong tarpaulin with corner grommets. When dock lines are attached, the tarpaulin can be maneuvered to cover a damaged hull area from the outside, then secured. Alternatively, there is a commercially available product that operates as a “leak umbrella,” which is inserted from the inside of the boat through a large opening in the hull and is then opened up in umbrella-like fashion to cover the hole and secured with the handle. Although these actions may not stop all leaking, they can significantly reduce the water inflow.

• Be prepared to take advantage of the engine to gain greater pumping capacity, as shown in the sidebar “Increasing Pumping Capacity,” on this page. The alternative system can also be used to admit a small, controlled amount of water into the bilge for testing the operation of automatic bilge pump controls, and for cleaning.

### Taking Immediate Action

As soon as you suspect damage that might cause a threatening leak, switch on all electric bilge pumps. (Even if you discover no leak, the pumps will not be damaged by a brief run without water to pump.)

Assign someone the task of calling for emergency assistance (see this page)—even before you are certain that you will need help. Activate a manual pump if you have an extra person on board. Then investigate for any possible damage.

Caution for boats connected to shore power, or when an onboard 120-volt AC genset is running: If your boat has suffered hull damage as the result of a collision with another boat or an object, consider the possibility that the collision might also have damaged the vessel’s electrical system. If a live electrical wire has been knocked loose and is discharging current into bilge water, anyone stepping into that bilge water could suffer a serious, possibly fatal, shock. If electrical wires have been pulled loose and come into contact with bilge water, or you notice any electrical sparking, shut down the main breakers in your AC and DC electrical panels before exposing yourself to the water in the bilge.

Remember that a boat floats as long as water is pumped out at least as fast as it comes in. Assign someone to investigate the extent of the damage by checking the bilge. If conditions permit, make this investigation yourself. If leaking is rapid, plug the leak and do everything possible to remove the water. Do whatever works fastest with the materials at hand, from the emergency pumping procedure shown in the sidebar “Increasing Pumping Capacity” to forming a bucket brigade. If your leak occurs offshore, keep in mind that USCG aircraft carry emergency pumps that can be dropped in floating containers to boats that need them. Operating instructions are on and in the containers.

### Stopping the Inflow of Water

The action that you take to stem the flow of water into your boat will depend on the nature of the leak itself. Almost anything soft can be stuffed into a hole in the hull—from cushions and pillows to bedding and spare sails (never use life jackets; you might need them). As quickly as possible, reinforce soft plug materials with something flat and solid, such as a hatch cover, battens, or bed slats. Assign a crewmember to hold the plug in place. The plug should be monitored at all times by a crewmember, while others continue pumping overboard the water that has entered the boat. In the meantime, head the boat to a nearby destination where necessary repairs can be made. If it gets really bad, you might consider beaching the boat at the nearest landfall.

If the material is applied from the outside—the most effective method, since water pressure will help to hold it in place—the boat must be stopped while the temporary patch or plug is positioned and secured. If you are going to try to reach shore with such a rig in place, make certain its top edge is well above your vessel’s waterline, and proceed slowly.

##### INCREASING PUMPING CAPACITY

In an emergency underway, when the bilge is flooding and the boat’s pump(s) cannot keep up with the inflow, the engine’s cooling system can be valuable to stem the inflow of water in one of the following ways:

• You can improvise by simply stopping the engine, shutting the seacock, and removing the intake hose, keeping it below water level in the bilge; make sure the new intake is ahead of the engine’s raw water strainer.

Important: Make sure your boat is equipped with a replacement hose. When removing the intake hose, you may discover that it has bonded to the seacock and will rip or have to be cut away. Unless you have a replacement hose in good condition, you will lose the use of your engine.

• Alternatively, you can modify your intake system as shown here—by installing a “T” connection and hose, fitted with a strainer, to the lowest point in the bilge; this should be ahead of the engine’s raw water strainer. This hose must have an in-line shut-off valve—keep it closed in normal operation. To activate the emergency pumping system, close the seacock and open the valve in the bypass line. The engine will then use the bilge water as coolant.

In most systems, the end of the intake hose can be removed (after shutting its seacock) and placed in the bilge.

Important: When activated, this system must be constantly monitored to prevent damage to engine(s) if water drops below the pickup level; the two valves can each be partially opened and adjusted to match the pumping action to the inflow volume. In addition, when engines are shut down, the bypass must be turned back to seacock mode once the leak is under control. This system is only for emergency pumping—never use it to flush out dirty bilges.

A “T” connection with in-line valve can be installed as shown. The cut-off or bypass valve must be securely closed in normal use.

## FIRES & EXPLOSIONS

Fire on a boat is a very serious matter. Your surroundings are burning and you have nowhere to go except overboard into the water. Fire safety is something that everyone who owns or operates a boat should practice. Each year, boating fires and explosions injure hundreds of boaters and cause millions of dollars in property damage. While there is a greater chance of a fire or explosion on a boat than on land, most of these accidents can be prevented.

### Preventing Fires on Board

Keep in mind that most fires are preventable. A boat kept in shipshape condition, with clean bilges and proper stowage of fuel and gear, is not likely to have a fire. Prevention requires constant attention; whenever you see a condition on your boat that might contribute to a fire, correct it at once.

Fires do occur despite a skipper’s best efforts, so always keep the firefighting gear accessible and in good working condition. Stow some life jackets well forward in case of fire aft, or in case you must abandon ship over the bow.

Fuel and fuel vapors are two of the leading ingredients in all boating accidents involving fires and explosions. Follow the guidelines for safe fueling (see this page), as well as the following reminders provided by the United States Coast Guard and the National Fire Protection Association.

#### General & Seasonal Checks

• Be alert for damage to your boat’s fuel system. Over a period of time, fuel fittings and fuel hoses wear out. Inspect all fittings and hoses regularly, especially near the engine where engine heat and vibration can accelerate deterioration.

• Inspect fuel tanks annually. Pay particular attention to bottom surfaces, which may have been in contact with bilge water, and also any part of the tank that touches the boat structure. The tank could have rusted or been damaged due to rubbing and abrasion. A suitable vent pipe for each tank should lead outside the hull; vents should never terminate in closed spaces such as the engine compartment or under the deck.

• Be sure the fuel fill pipe is tightly fitted to the fill plate and located outside closed compartments. Also, the fill pipe should be located where any spilled fuel will be directed overboard. Look for fuel fill hoses that are dry and cracked or soft and mushy. Such hoses should be replaced with marine fuel hoses immediately.

• If a hose or fuel tank leaks, replace it before using your boat again, even for a short time.

• On a boat with portable fuel tanks, make sure the vents can be closed and that the tanks have vapor-tight, leak-proof caps. The vent on a portable tank should be open when the motor is running, but when the tank is not in use, the vent and the cap should be tightly closed.

• Never leave motor fuel or other flammable liquids in open buckets.

• If the boat has powered ventilation (a bilge blower), make sure the blower operates.

• If your engine is equipped with a backfire flame arrester, keep the flame arrester screen clean.

• Be sure heating and cooking appliances on board are secured and operate properly. Refer to the owner’s manual for the appliance for guidance on inspecting for leaks in valves and connections; never use a match.

• In the galley, fit splash-proof covers to appliances and controls. Keep the galley clean, especially the sides of pans and any grease filters. Never leave the galley unattended when power or fuel is switched on.

• Make sure that flammable items are stowed safely and cannot come into contact with cooking or heating appliances or hot engine parts.

• Install a sniffer-type alarm if your galley stove uses a heavier-than-air fuel, such as propane, or if the boat has a gasoline engine. Otherwise, fumes from these fuels may settle in the bilge, undetected by crewmembers; an open flame or spark could ignite the fumes.

• Make sure that Coast Guard–approved fire extinguishers (refer to this page) on board are in working order—that gauges register and that nozzles are clear. Take a boating safety course that teaches the correct use of a fire extinguisher on board a boat. The time to learn is before a fire occurs.

• Look for bare wires or loose electrical connections; these might cause a short in your boat’s electrical system, which could start a fire.

• Do not store small disposable propane cylinders or charcoal lighting fluid below deck.

• Discourage or minimize drinking of alcohol while the boat is underway. This applies not only to the skipper but to all persons on board.

• Do not permit anyone to smoke when they are in bed, refueling, or changing propane, CNG, or butane bottles. Advise all on board to never leave a lighted cigarette unattended, to put it out when finished, and to use an ashtray that will not slide off a table and overturn should the boat rock or heel over.

• Dispose of paper and packing material as soon as stores are broken out.

• Keep lightbulbs clean; make sure that wattage is proper for each fitting.

• Never store oily cloths or combustible material in lockers.

• If working with wood chips, sawdust, and shavings, sweep up and dispose of the scraps as soon as possible.

• When hauled out, if your boat does not have a metal hull, install an earth lightning conductor.

• Conduct a bow-to-stern inspection, checking for loose fuel, gas fumes, and any malfunctioning instruments.

#### Before Casting Off

• “Sniff” your bilges. Usually your nose is the best fuel/vapor detector. This will mean getting down on your hands and knees; however, it is the best way to check.

• Operate the bilge blower for at least four minutes before starting an inboard gasoline engine. If you still smell fumes after four minutes, find what is causing them and make repairs before starting the engine.

• Make sure the locations of your fire extinguishers are known to all persons on board.

• When refueling, close all hatches, ports, and other openings; shut off all engines and motors; and ensure that all persons refrain from smoking. Fill all portable tanks on shore.

• After refueling, wipe up or wash off any excess or spilled fuel; open all hatches and ports, and let the boat air out.

### Fighting a Fire on Board

Unfortunately, sometimes fires do occur despite a skipper’s best efforts. Chances are, however, that this will result in a less severe emergency than it might if the required firefighting gear (this page) is on board, in good working condition and readily accessible, and if those aboard respond with speed. See Table 12-1 for information on the various types of extinguishing agents and the type of fires on which each should be used.

Table 12-1 Familiarize yourself with the various types of extinguishing agents and the kinds of fires for which they are suitable.

#### Explosions & Fires

A fire may start with a dramatic explosion or on a much smaller scale. The skipper of every boat should have in mind the action to be taken if fire strikes; see Figure 12-04. The first consideration must be for the passengers, and the skipper should have a plan for abandoning ship if need be; see this page. If you have a gasoline explosion, there usually is little you can do except reach for a PFD if you can and go over the side. When clear of the danger, account for all crewmembers. Give whatever assistance you can to anyone injured or in the water without a buoyant device. Keep everyone together in a group—for morale and to aid rescue operations.

Figure 12-04 Fire on board a boat is a very serious matter. If the fire starts with an explosion, there is usually little you can do except grab a life preserver and go over the side without delay.

If abandoning ship is not immediately indicated, take the following steps as quickly as possible:

• Head the boat, if possible, so the flames blow outboard, not inboard.

• Make a radio distress call (this page), if time permits, giving the boat’s location.

• Make sure the passengers move to the safest areas of the boat, such as forward with the bow into the wind, with their life preservers on.

• Reach for the appropriate fire extinguisher (this page), and fight the fire as described below.

#### Fighting Fires of Various Types

Fires require four elements for their existence—fuel, oxygen (air), heat, and uninhibited chemical chain reactions—remove or interrupt any of these and the fire will go out. Many fires are fought by smothering (shutting off the flow of air) or by cooling them below the temperature that will support combustion. Others are extinguished by interrupting the chain reactions of the combustion process—this is the action of dry-chemical extinguishers so widely used on small boats.

In fighting a fire, specific procedures and precautions must be followed. Hold the extinguisher upright and pull the pin. Stand back from the fire roughly 10 to 15 feet (3-5 m), and squeeze the handle. Always remember that a typical small marine fire extinguisher has a discharge time of only 8 to 20 seconds. From the start of the discharge, aim at the base of the fire, not the smoke. As the flames begin to die down, slowly approach the fire more closely. Never prematurely consider the fire to be extinguished until the material has substantially cooled down—be alert for a flashback. Wait until you believe that the burned material has sufficiently cooled down—and then wait a while longer. Opening an access hatch prematurely can let in enough fresh air (oxygen) to turn a smoldering fire into an inferno. Never get into a position where the fire, burning or “extinguished,” is between you and a safe exit.

• Galley Fires Fires in the galley are most likely to be fueled by flammable liquids such as grease, propane, or alcohol, or by combustible solid materials such as paper, wood, or fabric. A U.S. Coast Guard–approved Class ABC extinguisher will be effective against both kinds of fires; see Figure 12-05. If no extinguisher is available, use materials at hand, such as baking soda or a water-soaked towel. If using baking soda, pour some in your hand, then throw it at the base of the flames. Do not use water on grease fires; the grease will float on top of the water and can carry flames to other parts of the vessel. The same can happen with a fire involving alcohol stove fuel.

Figure 12-05 Do not use water on a grease fire; it may spread the flames. In using a hand-portable extinguisher, pull out the lock pin and squeeze the two handle levers together. Aim at the base of the flames with a sweeping action if the burning area is large. Keep the stream steadily on the base of the flames until the fire is out—or until the extinguisher is empty, a matter of only 8 to 20 seconds.

• If your stove uses propane for cooking, turn off the fuel supply from the tank. (The shut-off valve should be near the stove, but neither behind it nor in a location that will require reaching through flames.) Once the fuel supply is cut off, let the fire burn itself out. If necessary, soak nearby wooden or fabric surfaces with water to keep the fire from spreading.

• Gasoline, Diesel Oil, or Grease Fires Use a Class B dry-chemical, CO2, or foam extinguisher. Do not use water, which will only spread the flames. A common source of deck fires aboard boats is the gasoline used to fuel the dinghy’s outboard motor. Although Coast Guard regulations do not require that a fire extinguisher be carried in most dinghies, you should keep a Class B extinguisher on board and make certain it is nearby whenever you are handling gasoline.

• Fires Belowdecks Fires in a vessel’s cabins or lockers will most often be fueled by combustible material such as wood, paper, or fabric. You should have a Class A extinguisher mounted below where you and your crew can get to it easily, even in the dark. If no Class A extinguisher is available, flood the fire’s base with water and/or rob the fire of oxygen by closing a door or hatch to snuff it out. Throw burning materials over the side if you can.

If you must open a door or hatch behind which fire may be burning, feel its exterior first. If it is too hot for you to touch, the fire is probably still burning. If you must open the door or hatch, have a portable Class A extinguisher ready, open the door slowly, stay as low as possible, and keep the door or hatch between yourself and the possible fire.

• Engine Fires If the engine-room fire extinguisher system has not discharged automatically, activate it manually. Stop all engines and generators in the engine space involved with the fire—if any engine continues to run, it will draw in some of the fire suppressant gasses, reducing the amount available to fight the fire, and at the same time draw in outside air that will further fuel the fire; automatic shut-down devices are available. Close all engine-room doors and hatches.

Order a trained crewmember to stand by the life raft and prepare to launch it; order the crew into life jackets. Transmit a Mayday distress call and message or Pan-Pan urgency call and message (see this page). If the engine-room fire extinguisher has discharged, keep all engine-room doors and hatches closed for 15 minutes before opening.

If you must use a portable fire extinguisher, aim it at the base of the flames, through the smallest access hole to the engine compartment; this minimizes the flow of air into the area of the fire and avoids spreading the flames into the rest of the boat. It is highly desirable that engine compartments have one or more small “fire ports” just large enough for the nozzle of an extinguisher

• Electrical Fires Use an approved Class C fire extinguisher designed specifically for this purpose; never use water, which conducts electricity. Fires in electrical-wiring insulation cannot sustain themselves without a great deal of oxygen; if your circuit panels are encased in a heavy metal box, in many cases closing the box will be sufficient to extinguish a fire.

## MAN OVERBOARD

A crewmember or guest falling overboard is one of the most frightening emergencies on any vessel. Although man-overboard (MOB) (male or female) drills have been a routine element of boating courses for many decades, they have been largely overlooked by many otherwise responsible powerboat and sailboat operators.

In recent years, on-the-water research on sailboats and powerboats alike has resulted in some dramatic changes to recommended man-overboard techniques. Testing by the Naval Academy Sailing Squadron in Annapolis and the Sailing Foundation of Seattle, Washington, has shown that the priority is getting the boat near the man-overboard victim as soon as possible so that he or she stays in sight of those on deck. Once the person in the water disappears from sight, the odds of a successful rescue are low.

Man-overboard victims face a number of dangers, including panic, injury during the fall, and hypothermia. For those on board the boat, quick thinking and coordinated action are essential to an effective rescue. Control of the situation is most likely to be maintained by those who have prepared themselves with regular drills. For such boaters, the retrieval of the person overboard will be automatic and effective without many shouted orders, and the passage or outing will continue without undue stress.

### Immediate Actions

The simplest and most efficient procedure is to follow the four steps below:

1. Shout “MAN OVERBOARD” and keep eyes on the victim. When someone has fallen overboard, immediate action is vital. Any crew-member who sees a person go overboard should immediately and loudly shout, “MAN OVERBOARD STARBOARD” or “MAN OVERBOARD PORT,” while at the same time keeping his or her eyes on the victim, pointing emphatically to the person in the water; see Figure 12-06. This crewmember should not be assigned or accept any other duties.

Figure 12-06 Constant vigilance is essential in a man-overboard rescue. Anyone who sees the person fall should shout immediately and loudly, “Man overboard, starboard (or port).” Make sure that one or more crewmembers keep the victim in sight at all times.

Every second counts; this is an all-hands-on-deck procedure. The other crewmembers on board should put on approved PFDs and harnesses. (The last thing you want is another person overboard to recover.) All crewmembers should come on deck to assist in the maneuvers. Some of the crew will be assigned exact duties while others will automatically add eyes on the victim.

2. Simultaneously, throw over a man-overboard rig. One crewmember will jettison the rig—depending on the particular equipment aboard. This might range from a PFD to a sophisticated man-overboard module containing a single-person life raft with a drogue to slow down its drift, a life vest, and 8-foot pole, a strobe light, a radio beacon, survival food, etc.

For most boats, however, a practical and effective system is a buoyant pole at least 8 feet long, with its top marked by a large international orange flag and a water-activated strobe light and a weight at the other end. Such a rig usually includes a horseshoe life ring, a whistle, and a small drogue. It is highly visible, and serves a double purpose: It focuses the action so that both the skipper of the boat and the victim will try to aim for the lighted pole

The rig must be launched quickly—in a matter of seconds. If you do not have such a man-overboard rig, throw the buoyant device that can be deployed the fastest—for example, a United States Coast Guard–approved cockpit cushion (ideally, high-visibility red or orange) or a quick-release life ring. Throw the device upwind of the victim so that it can blow toward him or her. (Other boats use a Lifesling or other patented recovery device, which should be used according to the manufacturer’s specific instructions.)

In addition, three other tasks should be assigned: One crewmember should note compass heading, wind speed, wind direction, and time. Another crewmember should be issuing a Pan-Pan radio call (see this page) to alert both the Coast Guard and other boats in the vicinity of the emergency. Finally, throwing a constant line of floating debris will aid in tracking the victim.

GPS receivers have a “MOB” button on the front panel. Press this immediately to record the latitude and longitude of the position where the person went overboard. Many display a course back to the scene of the incident. Wearable man-overboard alarm transmitters will automatically sound an alarm if the user enters the water.

3. Also, simultaneously the helmsman should stop the boat’s forward progress as soon as possible and then quickly reverse course.

• On a powerboat, go briefly into reverse to slow down and at the same time turn toward the victim in a simple circle. In a study conducted by the Seattle Sailing Foundation’s Safety at Sea Committee, 300 actual live-victim recoveries were made. After testing four different maneuvers for boats under power, the committee found that this simple turn—involving an immediate reduced-speed return—meets all of the criteria for small-craft man-overboard rescue. It keeps the boat close to the victim and is the safest, most reliable, and quickest of all the methods tried—regardless of the experience of the operator.

At night or in reduced visibility, and when you are not sure when the person fell overboard, the Williamson Turn, see Figure 12-07, might be your best way of reversing course under power: Put the helm hard over, turning toward the side (if known) over which the person fell overboard, until your heading has changed 60 degrees. Then quickly reverse the rudder and come around 240 degrees.

Figure 12-07 The Williamson Turn, a traditional rescue technique, is usually the method of choice for a motorboat when the location of the person in the water is uncertain. This method is also used in compass compensation, as described in Chapter 13.

You should then be heading back on the exact reciprocal course.

• On a sailboat, it is almost always best to use the Quick-Stop method shown in Figure 12-08. (Even if you opt to start your engine, continue, at least initially, under sail. Dropping the sails costs precious time and sacrifices some control of the boat.) Head into the wind immediately, trimming sails flat. Continue the turn, tacking, without releasing the jibsheet. The jib will be backed on your new tack, which helps swing the bow around and further reduces your speed. Continue the turn away from the wind. When you’re headed downwind, your close-trimmed sails will catch very little wind. At your closest point of approach to the MOB, throw more flotation in his or her direction if possible. Once downwind of the MOB, round up to bring him or her alongside, meanwhile dowsing or furling the jib unless you plan to let it flap in the final stages of recovery. If uncertain of your ability to maneuver for recovery under main and jib or main alone, start the engine and make your final approach under power.

Figure 12-08 The Quick-Stop method of rescue stops a sailboat’s forward progress by immediately heading into the wind and tacking back to the person overboard.

If the spinnaker is set, let the guy forward to the forestay, round up into the wind, and haul the sheet tight. Drop the halyard (or cut it, if need be) and collect the spinnaker under the boom and into the main hatch. Do not worry about neatness; only the speed of the recovery is important.

In a case where the MOB marker has clearly been launched some time after the person has fallen overboard, it may be best to jibe, as this maneuver has a greater likelihood of reversing course with the fastest speed. (Remember that the victim may drift downwind, especially in large waves.) The risk of this approach is that the greater boat speed carried through a jibe will increase your separation from the MOB before you reverse course.

### After Reaching the Victim

1. Getting closer to the victim. Under power, you can motor slowly alongside the victim, aiming just to windward or leeward according to your judgment. Positioning the boat to windward in high winds and seas may cause it to drift over the victim. Approaching on the victim’s leeward side, on the other hand, may result in the boat drifting away from the victim before rescuers can grab him. In general, recovery is easier if you approach to windward and present your leeward side to the victim; see Table 12-2.

#### WINDWARD VERSUS LEEWARD APPROACH

 

Advantages

Disadvantages

Windward

• Creates a lee for the victim.

• Ease of throwing a line or horseshoe ring.

• Best position from which a swimmer can assist victim.

• Wave action can suddenly throw a smaller boat on victim with disastrous results.

• A fast-drifting boat can push a victim under water.

Leeward

• Victim is protected from the boat going over or pounding on top of him.

• Close enough to pick up victim.

• Wave action can throw victim against the boat.

• Difficulty of staying to leeward.

• Boat may drift away faster than victim.

• Difficulty of throwing line or horseshoe ring against wind to victim.

• If victim is unconscious or injured, a swimmer might have to fight heavy waves to reach him or her.

Table 12-2 Whether to approach to windward or leeward of a person in the water is controversial. Consider wind and wave conditions when making a choice.

Plan to get no closer than 10 feet, and to reach a dead slow speed as you draw alongside. Remember that a boat traveling at more than one knot is impossible to either hang onto or stay with even if a line is thrown from the deck.

If you are recovering the victim under sail, you may choose one of the two methods described below to immobilize the boat and steady the deck for the recovery. (If you are unfamiliar with any of the sailing terms used here, refer to Chapter 8 and/or the Glossary, Appendix F).

• The Rod-Stop Method (named for sailor and yacht designer Rod Stephens). Dowse, roll up, or luff the jib. Cast off the main sheet and tie a preventer to the boom, bringing the boom all the way out to the leeward shrouds. Put the helm hard over as if to tack or heave-to. The boat should stall with the wind more or less abeam and a slight drift to leeward, moving ever so slowly forward while you effect a recovery.

• Heaving-to. Another option is to “heave-to” once you reach the person overboard by hauling on the windward jibsheet to back the jib, as described in Chapter 10. The boat should either stop altogether or keep moving forward slightly.

2. Recovering the person overboard. One way to quickly recover your victim is to use the increasingly popular MOB retrieval system called the Lifesling. This patented product features a padded sling at the end of a long line that you tow behind your boat, moving around in a circle until the victim can grab it in order to place under his or her arms for hoisting and retrieval, as shown in Figure 12-09. A Lifesling deployed during a Quick-Stop circle approach to the victim is an effective recovery combination.

Figure 12-09 A Lifesling greatly increases the chance of rescuing a conscious victim. In order to recover an unconscious person, another crewmember must enter the water to position the sling on the victim.

Whether you use a Lifesling or another method of retrieval, getting an exhausted, heavy victim on deck can be quite a challenge. In most cases, the person in the water will not be able to climb aboard because of extreme fatigue and waterlogged clothing. This stage can have tragic consequences if not acted upon efficiently and immediately. You must make a quick decision as to whether the recovery will be active or passive, as described below.

• In an active recovery, the victim is able to assist in getting on deck. You can use a sturdy ladder amidships. (Beware of using the transom; the victim could be pulled under the stern.) You can also rig two or three different lengths of line between a stanchion and another stanchion or a cleat, forming a makeshift ladder. Another alternative is to rig a line from a fixed point amidships, so that it reaches below water level, then lead it back around a stanchion to the windlass. Use this line as a lift to help the victim aboard. (Watch toes and limbs so as not to be caught against the hull.)

• In a passive recovery, however, the victim may be hypothermic, exhausted, or injured. (When falling overboard, a person often hits the lifelines and grabs on, dislocating a shoulder.) Or, even worse, the person overboard may be unconscious. If the victim is a child or slight person, two or more strong adults may be able to lift him or her on board. But if the victim is a full-size adult with waterlogged clothes, you will need a mechanical advantage.

On a powerboat, a safety line may help; otherwise, try a block and tackle. Do not go over the side unless you are certain beyond any doubt of being able to come back on board. If you must enter the water, it is absolutely essential that you wear a life jacket—for added buoyancy and to keep both hands free and ready to use. In a small boat, there is also a danger of capsizing while recovering, so take special care.

On a sailboat, recovery can be easier because of the opportunities of using the boom with a block and tackle (possibly the boom vang); be careful to prevent the boom from flogging back and forth while winching up. Another way is to lift the victim in the belly of the jib. (Although some people recovered this way have experienced claustrophobia, they were brought aboard nonetheless.) A third alternative is to use the main halyard, if the mainsail is down, or any other halyard that can be led to a sturdy winch.

## OTHER EMERGENCIES

The most likely major emergencies have been listed and discussed here—but there are others. Study your craft in detail and try to visualize what could go wrong—and then prepare plans for dealing with such occurrences. Some of the more typical emergencies are covered below.

##### WHAT TO DO IF YOU FALL OVERBOARD: SURVIVAL FLOATING

Just as important as acquiring the skills necessary for rescuing a person overboard is a knowledge of how to help yourself if you are the person overboard. The following tips can help you stay afloat until you are recovered.

• Keep your clothes on. If your shoes are light enough for you to swim comfortably, leave them on. If they weigh you down, however, remove them. Remove any heavy objects from any pockets in your clothing.

• If you can float on your back fairly easily, save energy by doing so. Kick only when necessary.

• While signaling for help or waiting for rescue, tread water to stay in an upright position, moving your hands back and forth and using a kick that requires little energy.

Remember, the more you move around in cold water, the quicker your body temperature will drop, and the faster hypothermia can set in.

• In warm water, conserve your energy by using the facedown floating technique shown below, called survival floating. Each move you make should be slow and easy.

• Every second counts. As soon as a heaved line reaches you, pass it around your chest and tie a bowline knot (see Chapter 23). If a Lifesling reaches you, slip into it immediately; refer to Figure 12-09.

• As the rescue boat approaches, stay away from both the stern and the bow of the boat.

• When trying to board the boat, don’t rush; it is important to make effective use of your remaining energy.

With your mouth above the water’s surface, hold your breath, put your face in the water, let your arms and legs dangle for several seconds. Then tilt your head back to raise your face above the surface, only high enough for your mouth to clear the water. As you raise your face, exhale. As your mouth clears the water, gently press down with your arms and bring your legs together. This will help keep your mouth above water. Take another breath and repeat the cycle.

### Deadheads & Shipping Containers

A deadhead is a log or large piece of timber that has become so waterlogged that little buoyancy remains. It usually floats with one end down, showing only a few inches of the other end; it barely rises and falls and is extremely difficult to spot, particularly from a fast boat or any boat at night. Deadheads are more dangerous than rocks or reefs because they are uncharted and may appear almost anywhere. The only action a boater can take is precautionary; maintain a sharp lookout while underway.

A generally similar hazard is a freight container that has fallen overboard. Every year literally thousands of them fall from the decks of container ships in rough seas; see Figure 12-10. These large objects, roughly 8 feet (2.4 m) square and 20 to 40 feet (6 to 12 m) in length, are designed to flood and sink if this happens—but that doesn’t always happen! Those that remain floating are a real hazard to small craft, especially at night. If your boating takes you into or across shipping lanes, add “floating containers” to your list of dangers that you must guard against.

Figure 12-10 Many thousands of freight containers are transported on all oceans all the time. Some are lost overboard in violent storms. Most of these will sink, but some will continue to float for lengthy periods; while floating, they constitute a serious hazard to small craft.

### Dismasting

A broken sailboat mast can result from failure in the standing rigging or—as in the case of ocean racing—pushing the boat past its designed performance limits. In any case, this emergency demands immediate attention. Make sure that all crewmembers are wearing life jackets, then direct them to take quick action to clear and secure all stray lines, rigging, sails, and other loose gear—anything that could foul the propeller or create such a drag as to affect the controllability of the boat. That done, now it is safe to turn on the auxiliary engine.

One great danger of dismasting is severe damage to your hull. In this case you must decide immediately to cut the mast loose and get free of it or to try to save it. In the latter case, it is essential to secure the mast tightly against the hull and cushion it with a mattress or pillows; see Figure 12–11.

Figure 12-11 While just being dismasted is bad enough, the spars and sails in the water alongside the craft can be a hazard to the hull and must be cut away or secured without delay.

Some resourceful sailors can jury-rig a new spar—from the mast stump or a whisker pole, for example—in order to catch at least some wind.

### Swamping, Foundering & Capsizing

A boat is “swamped” when it fills with water from over the side. The causes can vary, from large waves coming over the gunwales or the transom to reduced freeboard because the boat is overloaded. Or swamping may result from a sudden squall or a heavy wake from a larger vessel. Small wooden boats have enough buoyancy to remain afloat, and will not founder—sink—when swamped; most small fiberglass boats have buoyancy built into them in the form of plastic foam flotation material. Use anything at hand to bail out the water; otherwise, hand-paddle to the nearest shore; see Figure 12-12.

Figure 12-12 Small fiberglass craft have built-in added buoyancy so that when swamped they will not sink, but will remain floating in a level attitude. As long as possible, stay with your boat—you will be more likely to be located and rescued sooner.

A boat is “capsized” when it is knocked down so it lies on its side in the water or turns over—a frequent occurrence among small sailboats that are especially sensitive to sudden changes in the wind. Most small boats will remain in that position, unless righted, and will float enough to support any crew that had been on board.

Having capsized or swamped, it is important to remain calm and conserve energy. The general rule is to ensure that all crewmembers are wearing PFDs and that they stay with the boat; there may be possibilities of righting it, and rescuers will be able to find you more easily. Leave the boat only if it is headed toward a hazard. If the capsized boat is a small centerboard sailboat, improve your chances of recovery by trying to keep it from turning upside down. Stand on the centerboard, providing lever action; this is a technique taught in most basic sailing courses. If possible, have a crewmember attach a life jacket or other flotation device to the end of the mast. If you can, remove all sails before attempting to right the boat.

Take precautions against swamping and capsizing: Watch that loaded items do not shift from side to side; guard against too much power or speed on turns, and the wake of fast boats and large vessels. Take waves head on, or fine on the bow, at low speeds, giving the hull a chance to ride over rather than dive into them. Do not broach.

## HELICOPTER RESCUE

The U.S. Coast Guard uses helicopters as well as surface craft for search-and-rescue work. The USCG has equipped fixed-wing aircraft with droppable VHF radios. This equipment may be delivered to the distressed vessel if the Coast Guard is unable to establish communication.

When Coast Guard assistance is provided by helicopter rather than surface craft, the distressed boat’s skipper must know how to participate in the action. Such a rescue is most effective with the advance preparations described below.

#### Prior to Helicopter Arrival

• If possible, listen continuously to VHF Channel 16 (156.8 MHz) or other specified frequency.

• Select and clear the most suitable hoist area. For sailboats and powerboats, this often means clearing a dinghy or raft from the deck and towing it astern.

• If the hoist is to be performed in the dark, light the pickup areas as well as possible. Avoid shining any lights on the helicopter, however; this could blind the pilot. If there are obstructions in the vicinity, focus a light on them, making the pilot aware of their positions.

• To facilitate the helicopter pilot’s approach, make sure that he or she knows the pickup area location before the helicopter arrives.

• Remember that there will be a high noise level and significant downwash under the helicopter, so conversation between the deck crew will be almost impossible. Arrange a set of hand signals between those who will be assisting.

#### Assisting the Hoist

• Change the boat’s course, permitting the craft to ride as easily as possible with the wind on the bow, preferably on the port bow. The helicopter pilot’s seat is on the starboard side of the helicopter, which helps to give him or her the best view of the boat; see Figure 12-13.

Figure 12-13 Helicopter rescues are often made by the U.S. Coast Guard. Boaters being so aided must assist in the operation. Know what to do and what not to do. Even though a helicopter may not be a part of your drill, practice what actions you would take in an actual rescue.

• Reduce speed if necessary to ease the boat’s motion, but continue to maintain steerageway.

• On a small craft, there is not enough deck space to permit hoisting directly from the boat. In that case, you must assist the victim into the dinghy for hoisting from there.

• If you do not have radio contact with the helicopter, give a “thumbs up” signal when you are in all respects ready for the hoist; use a flashlight at night.

• Avoid static shock by allowing the basket or litter to touch down on the deck prior to handling.

• If a trail line is dropped by the helicopter, use it to guide the basket or litter to the deck and to steady the litter with moderate hand-held tension; do not fasten it to the boat. Make sure crewmembers’ feet remain clear of the line.

• Place the person to be lifted in the basket, sitting with hands and arms completely inside, or strap him or her in the litter. If possible, the person should be wearing a life jacket. Tag the patient with any medications that have been given or which are being taken regularly; send along identification and other personal papers.

• When the individual is ready to be hoisted, hook up the cable and signal the hoist operator that you are ready to hoist. Steady the litter to keep it from swinging or turning.

• If it is necessary to take a litter away from the hoist point, unhook the hoist cable, keeping it free for the helicopter to haul in. Do not secure the cable to the vessel or attempt to move a litter without unhooking it.

##### MOB ALERTS

Microelectronics can come to the rescue in emergency man-overboard situations, providing highly audible alerts to the crew on board and guiding the boat back to the person in the water. These alert devices can be especially desirable on boats with small crews and one-person watches. The devices range from a type of wristwatch to a pendant that straps on the wearer’s arm or a clip-on cylinder the size of a small flashlight. When the transmitter is immersed in water or goes outside the range set by the electronic monitoring system, it sends a radio message to a receiver located at the helm station, which sounds an immediate loud alarm. Most devices can also be tied to a GPS receiver, and when the alarm goes off, the MOB position is marked on the GPS display. Some units display the track back to victim; others come with a handheld direction finder that can be very helpful in locating the exact position of the person in the water in choppy seas or poor visibility. Either option could make all the difference in finding a man overboard at night.

## ABANDONING SHIP

The act of abandoning ship is filled with potential hazards and should be undertaken only if your vessel is fully on fire or is in imminent danger of sinking. Abandon ship only as a last resort: In many cases, even vessels that have been seriously damaged will remain afloat for hours, even days, due to their natural buoyancy or to air trapped inside their hulls or superstructures.

#### Preparations for Abandoning

At the first indication that a fire or a breach of your hull’s integrity may become grave enough to require abandoning ship, transmit a Mayday call. Review the procedure discussed here, and alert your crew that you are considering that extreme course of action. Give the abandon-ship order only when you are sure that no other option is viable.

• As soon as you even wonder if you might have to abandon ship, make certain that all crewmembers are warmly dressed and wearing personal flotation devices. In waters below 60°F (15°C), crewmembers should also put on immersion suits if they are available. Remember that exposure to hypothermia (extreme loss of body heat) is one of the greatest dangers. Long pants, long-sleeved shirts, sweaters and jackets—even if they are soaked—can help preserve valuable body heat. If you have to order your crew into the raft, they could very well wind up in the water, and warm clothing and a PFD could prove to be the difference between life and death.

In offshore situations, all the life jackets aboard should be Type 1 and, at a minimum, should be fitted with reflective patches and a whistle. Even better, they should also be equipped with strobe-type personal rescue lights and a small EPIRB or Personal Locator Beacon (see Chapter 20).

• Instruct a trained crewmember to stand by the life raft and prepare to launch it. If you carry your life raft belowdecks and/or it must be manually inflated, the crewmember should know where it is located as well as how to inflate it quickly, and that it must be inflated on deck rather than belowdecks or in the cockpit.

#### Actions When Abandoning

• The moment you decide to abandon ship, activate the 406 EPIRB or PLB. Make a VHF/DSC distress call (see this page). (Be sure the GPS is on.) Once activated, the radio will automatically repeat the DSC distress call until the call is answered by the Coast Guard or a ship equipped with a Class A DSC radio capable of acknowledging the DSC Mayday call. Listen for a voice response to your call. If no voice response is heard for 30 seconds, transmit a voice Mayday call on channel 16 to alert any non-DSC-capable radios in range.

Good choices of SSB frequencies would be 4.125 and 6.215 MHz (both simplex, meaning that you transmit and receive on the same frequency); these are monitored by all U.S. Coast Guard long-range communications facilities. Additional channels are monitored 24 hours each day; other frequencies are monitored during the day or night as appropriate for propagation conditions.

• Gather emergency supplies. If you are boating offshore, you should have an abandon-ship bag accessible at all times, stowed where you can grab it quickly on your way to the life raft. Such a bag should include signaling equipment; medical supplies; provisions, including at least a half-gallon of fresh water per person or a hand-operated reverse-osmosis watermaker or solar still; clothing and fishing supplies. Also make sure that your already activated vessel’s EPIRB (see Chapter 20) gets into your life raft.

• Make certain that your life raft is tethered to the boat, and launch it. In heavy seas, launch to leeward amidships—the boat’s most stable point. Once you have launched the raft, one crewmember should steady it while a second crewmember boards.

• Load the rest of your crew into the life raft and have them fend it off from your vessel while you load the emergency gear, to avoid snagging the raft on anything that might puncture it. If at all possible, the crew should step or jump directly into the life raft rather than jumping into the water and then trying to crawl up into it. This not only lessens the danger of crewmembers being swept away from the raft, but in cold waters, it also reduces the danger of hypothermia.

• Make sure your EPIRB is securely attached to your life raft and is indicating that it has been activated, and leave it on. If you have reason to believe that someone is within visual range, fire a red meteor or parachute flare as soon as you depart your vessel.

• If your boat is afire or about to sink, cut the lines tethering the life raft to it. But if it is merely awash, remember that an awash vessel is a larger target to spot than a lone life raft. Keep the life raft tethered to the boat as long as possible. (In heavy seas, free the heaving line and pay out the full length of the raft’s tether—keeping the raft away from the boat to avoid a puncture or being trapped beneath the boat.)

THE MARINER’S COMPASS

How a Compass Works • How It Should Be Selected & Installed How It Should Be Used • Variation & Deviation • Compass Compensation

The marine compass is a remarkable instrument, and the single most important navigational tool on any boat. It requires no power source; it guides you on all oceans and waterways, in fair weather and foul.

Your boat’s safety may well depend on her compass, and on your ability to use it properly. On long runs out of sight of land or aids to navigation, your compass enables you to steer accurately to your destination. In poor visibility you may have no other means of keeping on your course. Knowing the limitations of your magnetic compass is essential, but within these, you should trust it to guide you safely.

## HOW A COMPASS WORKS

Magnetism is a phenomenon that can only be known from its effects. It is a basic natural force and one that is essential to a vast number of devices, from incredibly complex electronic equipment to your boat’s simple magnetic compass.

Magnetism appears as a physical force between two objects of metal, usually iron or an alloy of iron and other metals, at least one of which has been previously magnetized and has become a magnet. The area around a magnet in which its effect can be detected is called a magnetic field. This is commonly pictured as innumerable lines of force, but these are purely a convention for illustration, and actual lines, as such, do not exist; see Figure 13-01, left, which is a typical illustration of a bar magnet with some of the lines of force shown. (An electric current flowing in a wire also creates a magnetic field; more on this later.)

Figure 13-01 The external effects of a bar magnet (left) exist within its field, represented by imaginary “lines of force.” The magnetic properties of the earth can be visualized as emanating from a powerful bar magnet at its center (right). Because the field is not quite aligned with the earth’s axis of rotation, the magnetic poles are offset from the geographic poles.

### Basic Law of Magnetism

Each magnet, regardless of size, has two poles where the magnetic action appears to be concentrated. These poles have opposite characteristics and are termed north and south. The basic law of magnetism is simple: Opposites attract; likes repel. Thus an N pole is attracted to an S pole but repels another N.

#### The Earth

The earth as a whole has magnetic properties and can be thought of as having a powerful bar magnet near its center; refer to Figure 13-01, right. The magnetic properties of the earth are not uniformly distributed, and as a consequence its magnetic poles are not at the locations of geographic poles. The magnetic pole in the northern hemisphere is named the North magnetic pole because of its general location; actually, it is more than 250 nautical miles from the North geographic pole, the pole of the earth’s rotation, and moves over time (more on this later). The South magnetic pole is more than 1,500 nautical miles from the South geographic pole.

#### The Basic Compass Principle

The basic principle of a magnetic compass is simple—a small bar magnet freely suspended in the earth’s magnetic field will align itself parallel to the lines of force of that field, and thus establish a direction. The end of a magnet that points generally north is termed its North pole, although it is actually the “north-seeking” pole; the other end is its South pole. Normally, the compass will not point to geographic north nor even provide the correct direction to the North magnetic pole. It gives, however, a reliable and consistent direction, and for the purposes of navigation this can be considered as being relatively constant over a period of several years.

The navigator usually has at hand information and rapid means for converting the reading of his compass to true geographic directions. He knows that if any local influences from magnetic geologic formations, iron or steel objects, and electrical wires can be neutralized (or measured and recorded), his compass will be a dependable magnetic direction finder, needing neither mechanical nor electrical power.

## COMPASS CONSTRUCTION

The construction of a typical compass is shown in Figure 13-02; it has more than one bar magnet from which to derive its force to align with the earth’s magnetic field. A circular disk of light, nonmagnetic material is mounted on a wire frame, also of nonmagnetic material. This is the card of the compass; it is marked around its circumference with graduations from which the direction can be read. Two or more magnets are attached to the frame, aligned with the N-S markings on the card.

Centrally placed under the frame is a bearing that rides on a hard, sharp point called the pivot; this in turn is supported from the outer case, which is the bowl of the compass. A cover of transparent material, the dome, is rigidly fastened to the top of the bowl with a leakproof seal; this may be either flat or hemispherical. Through a pluggable opening, the bowl is filled with a special nonfreezing liquid. An expansion diaphragm in the lower part of the bowl allows the fluid to expand and contract with temperature changes without bubbles being formed.

A float may be attached under the frame to partially suspend the card and magnets, and thus reduce friction and wear on the bearing and pivot. The compass liquid also helps to dampen any rapid oscillations or overswings of the card when direction is changed or rough weather is encountered. Gimbals, when provided, either internally or externally, are intended to help the compass card remain essentially level despite any rolling or pitching of the vessel. The best arrangement is two sets of rings, one pivoted on a fore-and-aft axis and the other on an athwartship axis.

Figure 13-02 This cross-section of a typical marine compass shows parallel permanent magnets mounted beneath the card. The magnets and card are attached to a light frame, which is supported on a pivot. The space inside the compass is filled with a liquid to dampen oscillation, and a diaphragm to allow for expansion and contraction with temperature changes. Other features, not labeled here, include a protective hood over the compass dome and a night light, usually red.

### Compass Cards

The card of a modern compass is divided into degrees, 360 to a full circle; the degrees increase clockwise around the card. North is 0° and the scale continues on around through 90° (East), 180° (South), and 270° (West) back to North, which is 360° or 0°. The spacing between graduations on the card will vary with the size of the compass, but 5-degree intervals are typical for most small-craft compasses (see Figure 13-03, left) with some larger compasses having 2-degree cards. Ships will normally have compasses with cards having 1-degree divisions; see Figure 13-03, right. Note that this card is also marked with the “points” of the compass (see Table 13.1). Numbers may be shown every 10 degrees from 10° to 350°, every 20 degrees from 20° to 340°, or every 30 degrees from 30° to 330°.

Figure 13-03 Compass cards for boats (left) are commonly graduated at 5-degree intervals, with the 10-degree marks heavier for easier reading. Numbers are usually at 30-degree intervals, and cardinal headings—North, East, South, West—may be shown as letters rather than numbers. Compasses for larger vessels (right) may have finer graduations: two degrees or even one. Intercardinal and combination headings are often shown; on the largest cards, “by-points” and even individual points, half-points, and quarter-points may be shown. See this page for an explanation of the point system.

Over or just outside the card is the index mark against which the graduations are read. This is the main or forward lubber’s line; it may be a mark on the inside of the bowl or it may be a part of the internal gimbal system; see Figure 13-04, and refer to Figure 13-02. There may also be additional marks at 45° and/or 90° from the main mark.

Figure 13-04 When a compass is designed for front viewing, the lubber’s line is on the side nearest the helmsman. The readings increase to the left, and a person accustomed to a conventional card must take care to avoid confusion when reading values between marks. These compasses are sometimes found on smaller craft. The scale at the bottom displays the boat’s inclination (angle of heel) to port or starboard.

The lubber’s line should be close enough to the card so that there is minimal parallax error, the change in the apparent value of a reading when viewing from one side of the compass as compared to reading the card from directly to the rear.

On some compass cards, the width of the major degree marks and the lubber’s line have significance. If the lubber’s line is one degree in width, for example, that fact can be used to estimate values that are intermediate between markings on the compass card; refer to Figure 13-05.

Figure 13-05 On some compasses, the width of the lubber’s line equals one degree on the card. The center drawing above shows how this feature can be used to read one degree either side of a main graduation. As shown at right, a reading slightly more or less than halfway between marks would indicate two or three degrees more or less than the nearest graduation.

#### Front-Reading Compasses

Some smaller and medium-size compasses are designed for mounting so as to be read from the front (i.e., the side nearest the viewer) rather than from above. All bulkhead-mounted compasses are front-reading. (See this page and this page for installation options.) The lubber’s line is aft, facing the helmsman, rather than on the far side of the card. This results in the increasing number sequence being to the left of the lubber’s line rather than to the right; refer to Figure 13-04. This can be confusing to a skipper accustomed to a more conventional “top-reading” compass. Some front-reading compasses can also be read from above using the lubber’s line above the front of the card—great care must be taken to understand the use of this style of compass; see Figure 13-04.

#### The Point System

In olden days, compass cards were subdivided into points—32 points to a complete circle, one point equal to 11¼ degrees (or 11°15′); refer also to Figure 1-37. These were named, not numbered, and a seaman early learned to “box the compass” by naming all the points. There were also half- and quarter-points when a smaller subdivision was needed.

The cardinal points—North, East, South, and West—and the intercardinal points, Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest—are still in common use as rough directions and as descriptions of wind directions. The combination points, such as NNE, ENE, and so on, are sometimes used for general directions, but the by-points, N by E (North by East), NE by N, NE by E, and the like, are rarely used.

The combination point system is now effectively obsolete. For those who do not wish to forget the past or want to learn points for ease in steering sailboats, however, a table of conversions between the point and degree systems is provided as Table 13-1.

Table 13-1 The point system was in common use before World War II. Few boaters now will learn to “box the compass” through all its 32 points, but the major directions are still familiar and very useful. In descending order, the points are known as cardinal (N, E, S, and W), intercardinal (such as NE and SE), combination points (such as NNE and ENE), and by-points (such as N by E, NE by N, etc.).

Some modern compass cards label the intercardinal points as well as the cardinal headings, and a few mark all points and even quarter-points; refer to Figure 13-03, right. The examples and problems that follow, however, will all be in terms of degrees. Note, however, that some statements of direction will be in degrees and minutes, there being 60 minutes in one degree. Minutes will have to be converted to decimal fractions for calculations.

#### Spherical Compasses

When the top over a compass is hemispherical, the dome serves to magnify and make the card appear much larger than it actually is. This aids in reading it closely, making it possible to steer a better course or take a better bearing. On some compasses with a hemispherical cover, the card itself is concave or dish-shaped rather than flat. This feature, combined with the shape of the dome, makes it possible to read the compass from a lower angle and at considerably greater distances; it is not necessary to stand more or less directly over the compass to read it. A compass with such a card of 5-inch (12.7 cm) “apparent diameter” (actually somewhat smaller in diameter) can be read from as far away as 10 feet (3m) or more.

If the compass as a whole is spherical, bowl as well as dome, there is a considerable gain in stability of the card. The effect of a whole sphere is to permit the fluid inside to remain relatively undisturbed by roll, pitch, or yaw; the result is superior performance in rough seas.

Some compasses have special features for use on sailboats. These include more extensive gimbaling so as to permit free movement of the card at considerable angles of heel, and additional lubber’s lines at 45 degrees and 90 degrees to either side of the one aligned with the craft’s keel as an aid in determining when to tack. These additional lubber’s lines are also useful when the helmsman sits to one side, as when sailing with a tiller. They can also be used to sight distant objects to determine distance off.

### Binnacles

Compasses are sometimes mounted directly on or through a horizontal surface. More often, however, the compass is mounted in an outer supporting case called a binnacle. This can be a simple case, sometimes with a light-shielding hood, which is then fastened down; refer to Figure 13-06. Or it can be a complete pedestal stand as might be used on larger sailboats. On smaller sailboats, a compass is sometimes mounted on a vertical or near-vertical bulkhead forward of the helm position.

Figure 13-06 Compasses offer a variety of mounting possibilities. A light-shielding hood cuts off excessive sunlight to aid in reading the compass. Most modern compasses have two sets of internal compensating magnets, usually at the bottom of the binnacle.

The outside of the binnacle or compass case, or any mounting bracket, should be black, preferably with a dull finish. There should be no shiny chromed parts that could reflect sunlight into the eyes of the helmsman.

#### Lighting

When compasses are lighted for night use, the lighting system is often a part of the compass case, cover, or binnacle. The light should be red in color and its intensity at a suitable level. If the light is not red, or is too bright, there is a risk of loss of the helmsman’s night vision—this will make it more difficult, or even impossible, for him to see aids to navigation, vessels, or other objects. On the other hand, a too dimly lit compass can be a source of eyestrain and a detriment to good steering. In some installations, a means is provided for varying the intensity of the light; this is a desirable feature.

#### Internal Compensators

As will be detailed later in this chapter, it usually is not possible to avoid all magnetic effects from iron and steel objects on the boat. The compass must then be compensated (adjusted) with small additional bar magnets located and polarized so they counteract these unwanted magnetic influences. Such compensators may be external to the compass and binnacle, but are more likely to be internal, usually a part of the binnacle unit; refer to Figures 13-02 and 13-06. Refer to this page and this page for more on local magnetic influences and compensation.

## SELECTION

Although a compass is relatively simple in its construction and operation, it is probably the most important navigational tool on board any boat. Considerable thought should be given to its selection. This is not the place for a hasty decision or for saving money by buying a small, cheap unit. In fog or night, or any other form of reduced visibility, your compass is the basic instrument that shows direction. Your safety will depend upon it; it has to be right!

### Quality

Almost any new compass will look fine in a store or on board a boat in the quiet motion of a marina slip or at a mooring. But its behavior underway, when the sea makes up and the craft pitches, rolls, and yaws, is of supreme importance. Will the card stick at some angle of heel? Will its motion be jerky, or smooth and easy? Are the card graduations legible and are different headings easily distinguished? Is the compass protected against large temperature changes? What if a bubble appears under its glass that might distract the helmsman? The answers to these questions will depend upon the quality of the compass. Select a compass fully adequate for your expected needs, and if a choice must be made, choose the better quality.

Examine a number of compasses before buying one. Pick them up; tilt and turn them, simulating motions to which they would be subjected in actual use afloat. The card should have a smooth, stable reaction, coming to rest without oscillating about the lubber’s line. Reasonable tilting, comparable to the rolling and pitching of your boat, should not appreciably affect the reading. In fairness to the compass, however, if it has internal correctors, they must have been zeroed-in before you make these motion tests; see this page, on zeroing-in.

### Size

All too often, a small compass will be selected and installed on a small boat for the simple reason that the boat is just that: small. This is not the correct approach. Because the boat is small, it will be subject to greater movement, both in normal operation and in rough waters. A small, cheap compass will have less stability and may even be completely unusable in severe conditions, perhaps just when it is most needed.

A compass for a boat should be as large as the physical limitations of mounting space sensibly permit—and the quality should be just as high as the owner’s budget can possibly allow.

### Card Selection

In selecting a compass for your boat, pay particular attention to the design of the card. Its graduations should be suited to the intended use. That a large craft may be held on course more easily and precisely than a small one is readily understandable. Thus the larger the vessel, the greater the number of divisions normally found around the outer edge of the card. Skippers of large ocean-going craft seem to prefer cards that can be read directly to two degrees, or even to single degrees. Studies have shown, however, that subdivisions smaller than five degrees may not be desirable. Cards with finer subdivisions may produce more eyestrain, require a higher intensity of illumination, and may result in greater steering action although no better course is made good. The experiences and preferences of the individual must govern here.

#### Choosing a Sailboat Compass Card

The helmsman of a sailboat is usually in an unprotected cockpit exposed to the weather. Spray and rain on the glass cover of the binnacle may obscure or distort the markings on the compass card. The smaller and more uniform the markings on the card, the easier it is for the helmsman to confuse one marking for another, lose his place on the card, and wander off course. This is especially true at night or offshore when he has no landmarks to warn him that he has been steering, for example, 055° instead of his intended course of 065°. And when he discovers his error, he may not know for how long he has been off course.

If the pattern on the card shows a large and prominent patch of contrasting color at the cardinal points and an even larger one at “North,” even an inexperienced helmsman can steer with surprising accuracy by relying on the general position of this distinctive pattern as his guide, vague and blurry though it may be.

### Testing

Although not always reliable, price is generally a fair indicator of quality. There are, however, simple tests that you can perform yourself to aid in judging between different units. When making any of these tests, make sure that any other compasses are at least four feet (1.2m) distant.

Test for minimum pivot friction (it should be zero) by turning the compass as a whole until a card graduation mark is exactly aligned with the lubber’s line, then bring a small magnet or an iron/steel object just close enough to the compass to cause the card to deflect 2 to 5 degrees to either side. Next, take it well away from the compass quickly, watching the card as you do so. The card should return to its former position exactly. This test is completed by drawing the card off to the other side—by moving the magnet or iron/steel object to the other side of the compass. Again the card should return to its initial position when the influence of the external magnet or steel object is removed. (Make sure that the object is moved far enough away each time for a fair test; turn a small magnet end-for-end—the card should not be affected.) Sticky pivots are rare, but they do occur, and the test is too simple and easy to make to omit doing it. Do not purchase a compass that does not pass this test.

Repeat the above procedure, but this time draw the card off to each side about 20 to 30 degrees. Release the external influence abruptly and observe the amount of overswing as the card returns back to, and past, its original setting. A compass with proper dampening will have a minimum overswing and will return to its proper position with a minimum of oscillation about that position.

These tests are relative; there are no absolute values to use as a standard. Thus these tests should be made on a comparative basis between several different compasses of the same model and between different models. Be fair, be careful—try to see that comparable tests are made on each compass.

## INSTALLATION

The installation of a compass, from initial site selection through to the actual mounting, is of critical importance to its performance. If any step is omitted or is not done carefully, it may never be possible to get the compass properly adjusted for precise navigation. Follow each step in detail and don’t rush the work.

### Locating the Compass

The first step is selecting the location in which to mount the compass. There are a number of factors to be considered, and some limitations that must be faced. Actually, you should consider where to place the unit before you buy the compass.

#### On Larger Craft

Ideally, the compass should be directly in front of the helmsman, placed so that he can read it without physical stress whether he sits or stands. Give some thought to comfort in rough weather and in conditions of poor visibility, day or night. His position is fairly well determined by the wheel or tiller. The compass has to be brought into what might be called his zone of comfort. Too far away, he bends forward to watch it; too close, he bends backward for better vision. Much of the time that person may be not only the helmsman but the forward and after lookout as well. So put the compass where he can bring his eyes to it for reading with a minimum of body movement. For the average person, a distance of 22 to 30 inches (56–76 cm) from his eyes with the head tilted forward not more than 20 degrees is about right. Additional details will be found in ABYC Standard T-17.

#### On Smaller Boats

Locating a compass on a small boat may be more of a problem. It must, of course, be located where it can be easily seen by the helmsman, preferably directly before him; see Figure 13-07. Such a location may not be physically possible, or it may be subject to undesirable magnetic influences that will cause deviation in the compass readings (see this page). It may be necessary to locate the compass to one side of the helm position. If so, check carefully for parallax error—the change in apparent reading when the compass is viewed from one side as compared with from directly behind. A slight difference in reading, perhaps up to 3 degrees, may be accepted, but more than that, which can easily occur, will result in inaccurate and perhaps dangerous navigation. If you have this mounting problem, check several models of compasses, as some designs will have less parallax error than others.

Figure 13-07 Boats smaller than this one nearly always present a major problem in locating a compass due to limited space and a poor magnetic environment. Finding the best location takes ingenuity and patience.

##### SUMMARY OF SELECTION CRITERIA

When shopping for a compass, choose a high-quality instrument. Consider the points below, and remember that your compass is the most important navigation tool on board your boat.

• The compass (and binnacle if applicable) should be of a design that can be mounted onboard your boat in a location that allows accurate, comfortable viewing.

• The card should be easily read and graduated to your preference.

• The card should remain level and not stick through reasonable angles of pitch or roll.

• The card should move, but slightly and uniformly, during any course change (simulated by slowly and smoothly rotating the compass through 90 degrees or more). Some small lag due to the inertia of the card is permissible, but the card should be deadbeat, swinging but once to a steady position, not oscillating about the lubber’s line.

• There should not be any significant parallax error when viewed from the side as compared from the rear.

• The compass or its binnacle should have built-in compensating magnets.

• The compass or binnacle should include provision for night lighting. (A means of adjusting the intensity of the light is desirable.)

• The dome should be hemispherically shaped rather than flat.

• The compass should have a fully internally gimbaled card and lubber’s line.

• The compass should be of a design that can be mounted on your boat in the most suitable position for it, with easy access to the adjusting screws for the internal compensators.

• The compass should have a metal or rubber expansion bellows or diaphragm in the assembly to prevent bubbles forming in the liquid due to temperature changes.

• The compass or binnacle should be waterproof and have some form of light-shielding hood.

• If the compass is second-hand, it should be very carefully checked.

• Buy a dependable instrument and pay the price. This is no place to cut corners; you get what you pay for.

#### On All Craft

A compass is often located off the centerline of the boat, and special care must be taken to ensure that it is properly aligned. A line running through the center of the card and the lubber’s line must be parallel with the centerline of the hull; see Figure 13-08.

Figure 13-08 If the compass is not mounted directly over the keel line, take care to make sure that a line through the center of the card and the lubber’s line is exactly parallel to the centerline of the boat.

On some boats that are either wide or are steered from one side or the other—such as catamarans, racing sailboats, or even workboats—additional compasses can be mounted at either side to make viewing more direct and accurate.

### Zeroing-In

A modern compass with internal compensators should be zeroed-in before being mounted on a boat. Zeroing-in is nothing more than adjusting the internal compensating magnets so that they have no effect on the compass. A compass that is subject only to the earth’s field has no need for compensation: there is no deviation to be removed. Thus before being installed, any deviation caused by the improper position of the compensators themselves must be removed so that the unit can go on board ready for whatever magnetic influences the boat may have. With these magnets properly set, any deviation will come from external sources. A quality compass will have been shipped with its internal compensating magnets set to zero, but check before installation to be sure that the settings have not been changed. The slots of the screws for the N-S and E-W compensators should be horizontal, but aligning the screw slots by eye, or with marks on the case, may not be sufficient for accurate navigation. Zeroing-in by trial and error is simple and effective. It does not require any knowledge of the direction of magnetic north.

#### How to Zero-In a Compass

Zeroing-in must be done off the boat and in an area well away from any magnetic influence such as iron or steel pipes and girders, radios, electric motors, etc. Don’t work wearing a steel belt buckle or wristwatch strap; keep all tools well away from the work area.

Select a board with two exactly parallel edges. Temporarily mount the compass on this board using nonmagnetic screws or tacks. Line up the lubber’s line with the parallel edges as closely as possible, but precise alignment is not necessary. On a level, flat surface—a plank will do fine, but not a table that may have screws or braces of magnetic material—place a reference edge, such as a book or straightedge, and the compass on its small board; see Figure 13-09. Move the board with the compass into close contact with the reference edge. Rotate the board and reference edge as a unit until the compass reads exactly North. Hold the reference edge steady in this position; it provides a fixed direction reference. Remove the board and compass, turn it end for end, then bring the other parallel side of the board snugly against the reference edge. The lubber’s line has now been exactly reversed. If the compass now reads South exactly, the N-S internal compensator is already zeroed-in and requires no adjustment.

Figure 13-09 A board with parallel edges and a large book are all that is needed to accomplish the zeroing-in process. A nonmagnetic screwdriver or a thin coin must be used to turn the adjusting screws for the compensating magnets.

If, however, the reading is not exactly South, an adjustment is needed; read the difference from 180° and make a note of it. Adjustments must be made with a nonmagnetic tool—a “screwdriver” made from a piece of brass rod with one end ground or filed down to a flat blade is often used; bend the other end over by 90° to form a handle that will facilitate small turns. A thin coin, such as a dime, can be used with some compasses. Slowly turn the N-S screw until half this difference is removed. (If the difference increases when you first turn the screw, turn it in the opposite direction until the desired result is obtained.) Now slightly realign the reference edge until the compass reads South exactly. Hold the reference edge firmly and again reverse the board.

The compass should now read N exactly. If it does not, the difference should be much smaller than the initial difference at South. If there is a difference, halve it by turning the N-S adjusting screw. Next, slightly realign the straightedge and board until the compass reads exactly North, always keeping the board snug against the reference edge. Once again, reverse the board, and check to see if the compass reads South. If it does not read South exactly, again halve the difference. Continue this procedure until the reversal yields zero difference, or as nearly zero as possible. When this process has been completed, the North-South axis of the compass coincides with the magnetic meridian.

Next adjust the East-West compensators in the same way. Line up on either an East or West heading, reverse the board and compass, and if the reading is not the exact opposite, halve the difference by turning the E-W screw in the correct direction as determined by trial and error. Continue working on the East and West headings just as on North and South until the desired results are obtained.

If exact reversals are not attainable, some unseen magnetic influence may be present. Move the zeroing-in project to a different location, and try again as above. It is also possible, although unlikely, that the compass is defective.

If the compass manufacturer provided instructions for zeroing-in, they should be followed.

Do not discard the temporary mounting board. It may be useful in testing for a possible site on the boat.

### Check for Magnetic Influences

With the compass properly zeroed-in, and the best location selected from the viewpoint of visibility and use, now check for undesirable magnetic influences. The site should be at least 2 feet (0.6 m) from engine instruments, radios, bilge vapor indicators, electric gauges and instruments, and any iron or steel. (Stainless steel is nearly always nonmagnetic, but there are many different alloys, and each item of such metal should be checked.) When one or more of these magnetic influences is too close, either it or the compass must be relocated. Fortunately, magnetic influence is subject to the “inverse square law”—double the distance from a disturbing force to the compass and you have reduced the effect to one-fourth; triple the distance and the effect is down to a relatively insignificant one-ninth.

Test for magnetic materials or influences that may be concealed from ready view. Make your test with the compass itself. Move the compass slowly and smoothly all around the proposed location without changing its orientation with the boat’s centerline. Watch the card; one thing only will make it turn: a magnetic influence—find this with the compass. If the influence cannot be moved away or replaced with nonmagnetic material, test to determine whether it is merely magnetic metal, a random piece of iron or steel, or a magnetized object. There is a difference between the effect of an object that is magnetized and one that is merely made of magnetic material. Successively bring the North and South poles of the compass near it. Both poles will be attracted if it is not magnetized. If it attracts one pole and repels the other, the object is magnetized. Demagnetization may be attempted; see this page.

Metal objects that move in normal operation should be moved. Turn the steering wheel fully in both directions; work the throttle, move the gearshift lever; open and close the windshield if it is near the compass. Try to duplicate all the changes that can occur in normal operation of the boat.

### Check for Electrical Influences

Electrical currents flowing in wires near the proposed location can also exert undesired influences on the compass. Hold or tape down the compass at the proposed location, then test every circuit that might affect the compass. Switch on and off, one at a time, all the electrical loads: radio, bilge pump, depth sounder, lights, windshield wipers, etc. Don’t overlook anything controlled by a switch on the panel or located near the proposed compass site. Start the engine so that its electrical instruments will be operating. If there is an auxiliary generating plant, start it. Make full sets of checks with the boat on two cardinal headings 90 degrees apart.

Twisting the two wires that carry current to the compass light (or any other electrical load near the compass) around one another will create a “twisted pair,” canceling the magnetic field created by the flow of current through the wires. Twisted-pair wiring should be used to connect the compass light, instruments, and switches near the compass.

#### Make a Complete Check

In summary, check everything, one item at a time, that might influence the compass at the intended location, carefully watching the card as items are switched on and off, moved back and forth, started and stopped. When the card moves during any of these tests, the compass has been affected. Ideally, the compass should be relocated or the cause of the influence removed or demagnetized. In practice, however, you may have to settle for two separate states of magnetic environment; for example, with and without windshield wipers working.

### Vibration

Vibration can make a compass completely unusable at an otherwise desirable location. It can actually make a card slowly but continuously spin. Even if vibration does not cause the card to spin, it could result in excessive pivot wear. Mount the compass temporarily but firmly in the planned location and watch for vibration at all ranges of engine rpm and boat speed; vibration is unpredictable and may occur only at certain engine speeds.

To avoid compass vibration, mount it on as solid a part of the boat as possible; a beam or deck is better than a wood or fiberglass panel. If vibration remains a problem, it may be eliminated or reduced by placing a block of foam rubber between the bottom of the compass and the boat’s structure. Craft with slow-turning diesel engines may require a special vibration-dampened binnacle.

### Mounting

Once the zero setting of the compass has been verified and the prospective location checked for undesirable magnetic influences, you can proceed to the actual compass mounting. Certain basic requirements must be met.

• The compass must be securely fastened to the boat.

• A line from the center of the card through the lubber’s line must be exactly parallel to the keel, the centerline of the boat; refer to Figure 13-08. (Ideally, the compass would be directly over the centerline. This often is not practical, but it must be mounted exactly parallel to the centerline.)

Establishing this line parallel to your boat’s centerline is quite simple, but it almost always takes a little more patience and time than you anticipate. Find the center of the transom using a measuring tape, and accurately mark that center on a piece of masking tape (so as not to permanently mark the boat). This is usually easy. Next you need a second center point at some convenient location forward of the compass position—this might be the track of the mainsheet traveler of a sailboat. Alternatively, you can use the bow rail and a second location aft of the intended position of the compass.

With help from some additional pairs of hands, stretch a string tightly between the two center points. Accurately measure out (athwartship) to the location you selected for your compass, and after marking off this distance at your transom and forward location, move the string to this new pair of points. If the string is higher than the area where the compass base will be, use a plumb bob to project the line. Of course, the boat must be on an even keel if a plumb bob is used.

Once you have checked to make sure you have accurately established your compass mounting line parallel to the boat’s centerline, you might just want to carefully scratch or mark a short permanent line for future reference. You must install your compass so the lubber’s line is exactly lined up with it. Many compasses have small alignment marks (forward and aft) where the housing touches the mounting surface, to aid in positioning on the scratch marks.

This alignment is extremely important, because an improperly aligned compass can never be properly adjusted for deviation and will have a constant error (in addition to deviation) no matter what your boat’s direction.

• The compass should be level; this is often at least partially accomplished by mounting brackets; if the compass has a cylindrical case, the bottom may need to be shimmed so that the unit is level. Bulkhead-mount compasses must be of the type intended for such installation; the mounting should be no more than a few degrees from true vertical.

• Magnetic material in the vicinity of the compass should be minimal. Wires near it, carrying direct current, must be twisted.

#### Fastening the Compass Down

Drill one mounting hole only. If during compensation later the compass must be slightly turned to correct any misalignment of the lubber’s line, more than one hole could present problems. When compensation has been accomplished, the remaining hole(s) can be drilled and the fastening job completed; a check of the compensation should be repeated after this is done. Use only nonmagnetic screws, and if possible, nonmagnetic tools.

A compass bracket that has only two holes for mounting requires precise alignment and leaves very little room for further adjustment. Often circular compass mounts have slots built in for fastening, and fasteners are tightened when alignment is completed. If such slots are not present, try using either masking tape or duct tape to hold the compass temporarily in place.

### If Your Boat Already Has a Compass

If you have a boat and it already has a compass installed, or if you are buying a boat that comes equipped with a compass, you can still benefit from the above information, as all too many factory- and owner-installed compasses have lubber’s lines not truly parallel to the centerline.

### Electronic Compasses

A simple magnetic compass is a basic navigation tool that should be on every boat. However, more and more small craft are additionally fitted with electronic compasses; this is nearly always a fluxgate compass; see Figure 13-10. These are more expensive than the previously described ordinary magnetic compasses, but not greatly so. A fluxgate compass has an electronic output that can be used in several ways. Applications can include digital displays, with as many remote readouts as you wish, or signals to an autopilot, or input data to electronic navigation systems. Various designs are used, but the basic principle is the sensing of the earth’s magnetic field by coils of wire and the amplification of these very weak signals by solid-state electronics. There are no moving parts, thus avoiding such problems of an ordinary magnetic compass as friction, lag, etc.

Figure 13-10 Electronic fluxgate compasses react to the same magnetic field of the earth as do traditional compasses, but they have no moving parts. The output is a digital signal that can be displayed for steering, used as the input to an autopilot, or as an input to electronic navigation systems.

Electricity is required for the operation of a fluxgate compass, but not a significant amount; in the event of a loss of electrical power, an electronic compass, of course, becomes inoperative, and you are back to your regular old-fashioned mariner’s compass. Fluxgate compasses are subject to the same disturbances as ordinary compasses, but the sensing unit can be remotely located in a position where these influences can be mitigated or minimized. (A common location is under a midship berth.) If needed, compensation can be applied, either with magnets or electronically. Variation can be electronically inserted so that the instrument gives true headings and directions. Careful alignment of the sensor unit with the vessel’s centerline is just as essential as for an ordinary mariner’s compass, but the remote readout units can be positioned anywhere that is convenient, and these have no need for precise alignment.

A more sophisticated, high-tech (and more expensive) version of a fluxgate compass includes three-axis gyro stabilization for improved accuracy and precision. Its electronic output can be used with a variety of navigation devices, such as autopilots, chartplotters, and radar displays, as well as a direct display of heading. The normal output is a magnetic heading, but if a GPS receiver is connected, or variation is entered manually, a true heading is available.

##### USING AN UNCOMPENSATED COMPASS

A compass that has not been compensated—had deviation removed or else had a deviation table prepared—cannot be used to navigate with a chart, but there are simple and practical uses for it.

An uncompensated compass may not measure directions correctly relative to magnetic north, but it does indicate directions in a stable, repeatable way if local conditions on the boat are unchanged. You can proceed from one point to another—for example, from one channel marker to the next, read the compass when you are right on course, and record that value. If you make the same run on another day, the reading will be the same, provided that you haven’t changed any magnetic influences near the compass. Thus if the day comes when it is foggy, or night catches you still out on the water, you can follow with confidence the compass heading that you recorded in good visibility.

It’s a good idea to record compass headings on all the runs you regularly make, particularly a route you might follow during period of reduced visibility. Run the route in clear weather and record the compass headings. One word of caution, however: run the course in both directions for each heading. You cannot add or subtract 180 degrees from the forward run to get a reading for the return; residual deviation may give an erroneous reading.

## USING A COMPASS

A compass is read by observing the graduation of the card that is opposite the lubber’s line. The card of a typical boat compass has major graduations every ten degrees, with lighter marks at intermediate five-degree intervals; refer to Figure 13-03, left. On some models the width of the lubber’s line is just about one degree. Thus it is possible to use this width to estimate fairly accurately a reading of one degree more or less than each card marking. A reading of slightly less or more than midway between the card markings gives the individual degree values; refer to Figure 13-05.

Always remember when a boat turns, it is the boat, and the lubber’s line, that turns—the compass card maintains the same orientation; see Figure 13-11.

Figure 13-11 When a boat changes heading, it is the boat itself and the lubber’s line of the compass that turns—the compass card maintains the same orientation as before the turn.

Like all other piloting instruments and techniques, your compass should be used frequently. Use it in good weather and sea conditions, even though it might not be needed. This will make you more familiar with how it is used and increase your confidence in it when it becomes a vital piloting tool at night or reduced visibility. Line up with a channel whose magnetic heading you know. Does your compass read that value (with any correction for deviation that is necessary)? Make note of your readings on frequently run tracks. Keep your compass course records handy and check the various headings frequently. If there is a change, look for the reason and eliminate it.

Using a compass for steering a boat and taking bearings is covered in later chapters.

#### Protection When Not in Use

The worst enemy of a compass is direct sunlight. When a boat sits day in and day out in a marina slip or on a mooring, something can and should be done about excess sunlight.

When a compass is not in use, it should be thoroughly shielded from the sun to prevent discoloration of the liquid and perhaps of the card. Sometimes a binnacle will have a light-shielding hood; if so, keep it closed whenever the compass is not in use. If such a shield is not a part of your compass, improvise one of lightproof material; if you use cloth, make sure it is a tight weave that will not “leak” direct sunlight.

## COMPASS ERRORS

Before a compass can be used for precise navigation, you must understand compass errors—the differences between compass readings and true directions measured from geographic North. Initially, when using charts, you probably will plot courses and bearings with respect to true North. With more experience, you may find it easier to use magnetic directions.

### Variation

The first and most basic compass error is variation (V or Var). For any given location on land or sea, this is the angle between the magnetic meridian and the geographic meridian; see Figure 13-12. It is the angle between true North and magnetic North as indicated by a compass that is free from any nearby influences. Variation is designated as East or West in accordance with the way the compass needle is deflected. Any statement of variation, except zero, must have one of these labels: E or W.

Figure 13-12 Variation is the angle between the magnetic and the true meridians. It depends on geographic location but is the same for all vessels in any vicinity. In North America, variation is generally easterly on the Pacific Coast and westerly on the Atlantic Coast and on the Great Lakes. There is a line of zero variation between these areas. To see the change in variation over time, go to maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/historical_declination/.

Variation is a compass error about which a navigator can do nothing but recognize its existence and make allowances for. Variation is the compass error that would exist on a boat entirely free from any onboard magnetic materials or other internal magnetic influences.

#### General Variation

The earth’s magnetic field is not uniform, and, because the magnetic poles are not at the geographic poles (refer to Figure 13-01, right), variation changes with location; refer to Figure 13-12. The result of failure to apply different variation as a vessel moves from one location to another can be seen in Figure 13-13.

Figure 13-13 Do not overlook the change in variation with change of location. In this example, the true and magnetic courses from X to Y are initially very nearly the same, but the magnetic course soon changes, while the true remains constant. By staying on the same magnetic heading, an aviator would soon be at Z, 150 miles west of his destination—the skipper of a boat would have run aground on the Rhode Island coast!

At any given place, the amount of variation is essentially constant. There is usually a small annual change, but if you are using a chart not more than two or three years old, this quite small amount of change can be ignored. The amount of variation, and its annual rate of change, is found within each compass rose on the chart; see Figure 13-14. On nearly all types of charts published by the National Ocean Service, part of NOAA (National Oceanic and Atomospheric Administration), there will be found several compass roses suitably placed for convenient plotting. These are circular figures several inches (perhaps 5 to 10 cm) in diameter with three concentric circular scales. The outer scale is graduated in degrees and it is oriented so that its zero point, indicated by a star symbol, points to true (geographic) North. The inner pair of scales is graduated in degrees and in the point system down to quarter-points. The zero point of these scales, identified by an arrow symbol, shows the direction of magnetic North at that point. On some charts, the innermost scale in points is omitted.

The angle at the center of a compass rose between the star and arrow symbols is the variation in that vicinity for the year stated. This information is printed at the center of the rose to the nearest 15′; for example, in Figure 13-14, “Var 17° 45′W (2003).” The annual rate of change is noted to the nearest 1′, and whether the variation is increasing or decreasing; for example, “Annual Increase 2′ ” or “Annual Decrease 6′ ” or “No Annual Change.” On older charts, apply the accumulated annual change to the variation value at the center of the rose. In all cases, use variation to the nearest whole degree—fractions are not practical for small craft.

As noted above, magnetic variation changes with location. Thus, except for charts of a limited area, such as a single harbor and its approaches, variation will most likely be different in various areas of a typical chart. For this reason, the variations graphically indicated by the several compass roses on any particular chart may be different. Always refer to the compass rose that is nearest your position on the chart to read variation or to plot from its scales. You can obtain up-to-date variation data on the web; see www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/.

Figure 13-14 Most charts have several compass roses that show the variations both graphically and descriptively. They are located so as to be convenient for plotting. On any chart, especially small-scale charts covering large areas, always use the compass rose nearest your position or the reference point you are using.

#### Local Attraction

In addition to the general overall magnetic variation, the navigator may also encounter local attraction. (Here “local” means a limited geographic vicinity, as opposed to magnetic influences on board the boat.) In a few localities, the compass is subject to irregular magnetic disturbances in the earth’s field over relatively small areas. A striking example is found at Kingston, Ontario, Canada, where variation may change as much as 45 degrees in a distance of a mile and a half (2.4 km).

Charts of areas subject to such local attraction will bear warnings to this effect. Other means of navigation are needed when within range of such disturbances.

### Deviation

A boat’s compass rarely exists in an environment that is completely free of nearby magnetic materials or influences. Normally it is subject to magnetic forces in addition to those of the earth’s field. Material already magnetized, or even capable of being magnetized by the magnets of the compass, will cause the compass needle to deviate from its proper alignment with the magnetic meridian. Currents flowing in improperly installed electrical wiring can have the same effect.

The deflection of the compass from its proper orientation is called deviation (D or Dev). It is the angle between the magnetic meridian and a line from the pivot through the North point of the compass card; it is the angle between the direction the compass would point if there were no deviating influences and the direction in which it actually does point. Theoretically, it can range from 0° to 180°, but in practice large values cannot be tolerated. Just as for variation, deviation can be East or West depending on whether compass North lies to the east or west of magnetic North. Deviation must carry one of these labels, E or W, unless it is zero; see Figure 13-15.

Figure 13-15 Deviation is the difference between North as indicated by the compass and magnetic North. It can be easterly or westerly, and depends on the magnetic conditions on the vessel. It changes with the boat’s heading but is not noticeably affected by changes in position within a geographic area.

While variation changes with geographic location, deviation changes with the craft’s heading and does not change noticeably in any given geographic area. (Causes for this effect will be explained later; see this page.) To cope with these changes, a vessel needs a deviation table—a compilation of deviations, usually for each 15 degrees of heading by the compass; see Table 13-2. For added convenience, a deviation table can also be prepared in terms of magnetic headings; see Table 13-3. (Note: In these examples, the values of deviation are large for purposes of illustration. They are typical of an uncompensated compass in a poor magnetic environment.)

Table 13-2 The first deviation table prepared will be in terms of compass heading; see this page for the procedure. This table is useful for correcting compass bearings so that they can be plotted. (Note that the table’s figures are much larger than would be tolerated in actual piloting. If deviations are this large, the compass needs compensating to reduce deviation to zero or nearly so.)

Table 13-3 Deviation in terms of magnetic headings, rather than compass headings, is needed to determine the compass course to be steered for a plotted magnetic direction. Here the values have been calculated and tabulated for each 15° magnetic heading.

#### Using Deviation Tables

For ordinary navigation, it is normally sufficient to use the value of deviation from the line of the table that is nearest to the craft’s actual heading, either compass or magnetic. This is particularly true for compensated compasses, on which the deviations will rarely exceed a few degrees.

For more precise navigation, such as in contests and perhaps some races, it will be necessary to interpolate between tabular entries to get a more precise value of deviation; see this page for interpolation procedures.

#### Changes in Deviation

Note that any deviation table is valid only on the boat for which it was prepared, and only for the magnetic conditions prevailing at the time the table was prepared. If magnetic materials within the radius of effect—some 3 to 5 feet (0.9–1.5 m)—are added, taken away, or relocated, a new deviation table must be prepared—or at a minimum, sufficient checks must be made of the old table to ensure that its values are still correct. If any electronic equipment is installed, removed, or relocated, check to see if a new table is needed.

## COMPASS CALCULATIONS

A boat’s course is the direction in which it is intended to be steered, and its heading is the direction it is pointing at any given moment. Three lines of reference have been established for identifying a course or heading: the direction of true North or the true meridian, the direction of the magnetic meridian, and the direction of the North point of the compass. Thus there are three ways to name a course or heading: true, magnetic, or compass. The three reference lines and the three measurements of direction for one heading are illustrated in Figure 13-16. The above remarks also apply to the measurement of directions for bearings.

Figure 13-16 A course, heading, or bearing, can be named in any one of three systems based on the reference direction used.

### Applying Variation & Deviation

To be able to use your compass fully, you must develop an ability to convert directions of one type to the other two quickly and accurately. These directions include headings, courses, and bearings. You use compass courses in steering your boat; you get compass bearings when you take a reading across your compass to a distant aid to navigation or landmark. The process of calculating true directions for plotting on your chart and making entries in the log involves an intermediate step, magnetic directions. These can be used directly if properly identified. Hence, there is need for continual interconversion between the three systems of naming direction.

Variation and deviation can be in the same direction (have the same label), or they may be opposite, and thus partially canceling; see Figure 13-17. (The amount of variation and deviation in this figure is exaggerated for greater clarity.)

Figure 13-17 Variation and deviation are sometimes combined algebraically into a single value, “compass error (CE).” These intentionally exaggerated drawings show the four possible combinations of easterly and westerly variation and deviation.

#### Single-Step Calculations

Although most compass calculations involve a double conversion from true to magnetic to compass or vice versa, it is best to consider single-step computations first.

The terms “correct” and “correcting” are used in easily remembered phrases to help determine whether to add or subtract deviation and variation. This is done by considering true directions as being more “correct” than magnetic, and magnetic as being more “correct” than compass directions. This can be rationalized and easily remembered by observing that true has no errors, magnetic has one error (variation), and compass includes two errors (variation and deviation). Going from compass to magnetic—or magnetic to true—can thus be termed “correcting.” Conversely, the term “uncorrecting” is used when going from true to magnetic or from magnetic to compass.

The basic rule is: When correcting, add easterly errors, which can be shortened to “Correcting add east” and memorized as “C-A-E”; see Example 1.

##### EXAMPLE 1

Given: The magnetic course is 061°; from the chart, the variation for the area in which we are navigating is 11°E; there is no deviation.

Required: The true course, TC.

Calculation: The conversion is one of correcting because we are going from magnetic to true. The variation is east, so the basic rule is used, Correcting add east.

061° + 11° = 072°

Answer: TC 072°

When “correcting” a magnetic course with easterly variation to a true course, add the variation.

The basic rule is easily altered for application to the three other operations of conversion. Remember to always change two, but only two words in the phrase for any application—never only one, never all three; see Examples 2 and 3.

##### EXAMPLE 2

Given: The magnetic course is 068°; the variation is 14° W; there is no deviation.

Required: The true course, TC.

Calculation: The conversion is correcting and the variation is westerly. In the basic rule, EAST has been changed to WEST; one word has been changed, another must be. Since this calculation is correcting, “add” must become “subtract.” The rule to be applied here is thus: Correcting subtract west.

068° − 14° = 054°

Answer: TC 054°

When “correcting” a magnetic course with westerly variation to a true course, subtract the variation.

##### EXAMPLE 3

Given: The course of the boat by its compass is 212°; the deviation for that heading is 5°E.

Required: The magnetic course, MC.

Calculation: The conversion is correcting and the deviation is easterly; the application rule is Correcting add east.

212° + 5° = 217°

Answer: MC 217°

Now consider the reverse process, uncorrecting. We again change two, but only two words to the basic rule and we get: Uncorrecting add west and Uncorrecting subtract east. (Don’t worry about remembering all four rules. It’s easier to remember the basic rule of C-A-E and how to change it to fit the other situations); see Examples 4 and 5.

##### EXAMPLE 4

Given: The true course is 351° and the variation is 12′W; there is no deviation.

Required: The magnetic course, MC.

Calculation: The conversion is uncorrecting and the variation is westerly. The applicable rule is Uncorrecting add west.

351° + 12° = 363° = 003°

Answer: MC 003°

##### EXAMPLE 5

Given: The magnetic course is 172° and the deviation for that heading is 7°E.

Required: The compass course, CC.

Calculation: The conversion is uncorrecting and the deviation is easterly. The application rule is Uncorrecting subtract east.

172° − 7° = 165°

Answer: CC 165°

In this example, a true course is “uncorrected” to a compass course, with the error of variation and deviation both westerly.

#### Two-Step Conversions

The same rules apply when two-step conversions are made from true to compass, or from compass to true. It is important to remember that the proper rule must be used for each step separately. It will always be correcting or uncorrecting for both steps, but the addition or subtraction may not be the same, as this is determined individually by the east or west nature of the variation and deviation; see Examples 6 and 7.

##### EXAMPLE 6

Given: The true course is 088°, the variation is 18°W, and the deviation is 12°W.

Required: The compass course, CC.

Calculation: Both conversions are uncorrecting and both errors are westerly. The rule for both calculations is Uncorrecting add west.

088° + 18° + 12° = 118°

Answer: CC 118°

##### EXAMPLE 7

Given: The compass bearing is 107′; the variation is 6°E, and the deviation for the heading that the boat is on is 2°W.

Required: The true bearing, TB.

Calculation: Both conversions are correcting; the variation is easterly but the deviation is westerly, so two rules are required: Correcting add east, subtract west.

107° + 6° − 2° = 111°

Answer: TB 111°

#### Other Memory Aids

The basic rule of Correcting add east and its variations is only one set of memory aids for compass calculations; there are many more. You need to know only one; study several and pick the one that is easiest for you to remember and apply.

Another that is easily memorized and used is Compass least, error east; Compass best, error west. This can be used for conversions such as those shown in the examples above, but it is of particular value when the difference between compass and magnetic is known numerically and it must be decided whether the deviation is east or west. For example: if the magnetic course is known to be 192° but the compass reads only 190°, what is the deviation? The numerical difference is 2° and the compass is “least”—190° is less than 192°—so the error is east; deviation is 2°E. If on the same heading, the compass had read 195°, the compass would then have been “best”—195° being more (better) than 192°—and the deviation would be 3°W.

When considering the variation as the difference between true and magnetic, apply the same phrase but with magnetic substituted for compass—the rhyme is not as good, but the principle is the same. For example: if a true bearing is 310°, and the variation is 4°W, then the magnetic bearing would be “best” (more than the value of the true bearing), 314°. If the variation had been easterly, then the magnetic bearing would have been “least” (or less than the true bearing), 306°.

#### Visual Aids

Many boaters find a pictorial device a better memory aid than a phrase or sentence. Letters are arranged vertically, representing the three ways of naming a direction—true, magnetic, and compass—with the respective differences—variation and deviation—properly placed between them. The arrangement can be memorized in several ways, such as True Virtue Makes Dull Company or in the reverse direction as Can Dead Men Vote Twice.

On each side of the letters, an arrow is drawn to indicate the direction of conversion. Also on each side, the appropriate arithmetic process is indicated for use with easterly or westerly errors; see Figure 13-18. The right side indicates correcting; the left side illustrates uncorrecting. If one memorizes D-A-W for Down add west, then the correct signs can always be added to the letters and arrows. Or use the mnemonics True Virtue Makes Dull Company, Add Whiskey and Can Dead Men Vote Twice At Elections as reminders to “add west” when uncorrecting and to “add east” when correcting.

Figure 13-18 A pictorial “TVMDC” diagram can be an aid in remembering the rules for converting between true, magnetic, and compass directions. Use the up (right) arrow for correcting and the down (left) arrow for uncorrecting.

##### EXAMPLE 8A

Given: From the chart, the true course is 107° and the variation in the locality is 5′E.

Required: The magnetic course, MC.

Calculation: The conversion is uncorrecting, so use the left side and read down the diagram. The variation is easterly so it is to be subtracted.

### Always Trust Your Compass

If you must depend on your compass for navigation, make a quick check for any objects near it that could cause additional, unmeasured deviations—typical objects that get placed too close to a compass include knives, beer and soft drink cans (if not aluminum), radios, some cameras and microphones, your flashlight, and tools of all sorts. If you have non-boater guests on board, be especially careful that one of them doesn’t unknowingly bring a “forbidden” object into the vicinity of the compass.

If your magnetic situation has been checked and is all clear, then trust your compass to direct you to your destination—it is better than your instincts!

#### The Importance of Accurate Helmsmanship

Keep in mind the results of not running an accurate course. If your compass or compass calculations should be in error by only 5 degrees, you will be a full mile off course for every 11½ miles run (1 km for every 11.4 km). This could be hazardous when making a landfall or a coastal run at night or in poor visibility. Also, running a narrow channel in poor visibility with an inaccurate compass would be dangerous. Note the increasing seriousness of even small errors as shown in Table 13-4.

## DETERMINING DEVIATION

Deviation is a property of each individual boat, and its effect must be determined for your own craft. It is the angle between the compass-card axis and the magnetic meridian; refer to Figure 13-15. On board any boat, the direction of compass North is easily learned by a quick glance at the compass card. Not so the direction of the magnetic meridian—magnetic North. Thus it is not possible to visually compare the angle between these two reference directions to determine the deviation on that heading. But the difference between an observed compass bearing and the known correct magnetic direction for that bearing yields that value.

Deviation should always be checked after purchase of a boat, new or used, and before it is taken on its first cruise. It is also desirable that deviation be checked annually, usually at the beginning of a boating season, and after the installation of any new electronic or electrical equipment near the compass. If a compass is replaced, a new deviation check is required even if the new unit appears identical to the old one.

### Deviation by Bow Bearings

The bearing is sighted over the compass with the boat headed directly toward the object or range. The magnetic direction is taken from the chart. The distant target can be a range of two objects, or it can be a single object if the location of the boat can be fixed precisely, such as close aboard an aid to navigation with the object far enough away that any slight offset of the boat is immaterial.

The range technique is the more accurate and is done as follows. Select two accurately charted, clearly visible, and easily identified objects from the chart. Measure and record the magnetic direction from the nearer to the farther mark. (The best ranges are those in the Light List; see this page; their true direction is given precisely, just apply variation to get magnetic.) See Figure 13-19; A and B are two charted objects, with B visible behind A. The magnetic direction of this range is 075°. The boat is run straight toward A on the range, keeping A and B visually in line. While steady on this heading, the compass is read and recorded. In this example it reads 060°; the amount of the difference is the deviation, 15 degrees. Reference to any of the conversion rules makes it clear that the deviation is east. You can set up other ranges and find the deviation on such headings by repeating the bow bearing procedure as above. Use the side of a long object (pier or large building) as a range if its direction can be determined from the chart. Use a buoy and a fixed object, or even two buoys, only if a range of fixed objects is unavailable. Remember that the charted position of a buoy is that of its anchor, and wind or current, or both, may swing it around its charted position. Large ships and tugs sometimes collide with buoys and move them off-station inadvertently in thick weather. Buoys thus give less accurate deviation table results; replace the data as soon as you can with a table made under better conditions.

Figure 13-19 The simplest way to determine deviation on any heading is to locate two objects to use as a range whose magnetic direction can be established from the chart. Head your boat toward this range and read the compass. The difference is the deviation on that heading; if there is no difference, the deviation on this heading is zero.

#### Deviation by Courses

Steering a visual course from one aid to navigation to another and noting the compass heading will, if the observation is made at the start of each leg, give reasonably good values of deviation when compared with the magnetic direction from the chart; see Figure 13-20. Sighting down the center of a long straight channel defined by aids to navigation or banks close by on either side is another excellent means of getting a compass heading to compare with the chart.

Figure 13-20 Carefully run courses between two charted positions can be used to determine deviation on a number of headings. Deviation will not be the same for reciprocal courses, and each direction must be run individually.

#### Deviation Table by Swinging Ship

A precise technique for developing a deviation table is to swing ship about a compass by running different headings across a range, recording the compass bearing of the range of each crossing. For example, two prominent charted objects are on a range with a magnetic bearing measuring 095°. On a calm day, the boat Water Witch sails across this range on compass headings successively 15 degrees apart. Using sight vanes and an azimuth circle mounted on the compass her skipper takes a bearing of the range for each crossing, and records and tabulates the results; see Table 13-5A.

Table 13-5A When determining deviation values, the first step is to construct a table as shown above. You already know that you will be reading range bearings at every 15° of compass heading, so list the compass headings in the first column of the table.

The skipper averages the various compass bearings and gets 94.91°; see Table 13-5B. He notes that this is very close to the magnetic bearing of the range from the chart and decides he has a good set of data.

Table 13-5B For the second step, use a pelorus (see this page) to obtain range bearings for every compass course heading, and record them in column two. Then find the average of your range bearings by adding all the values and dividing by the number of values; round off to the nearest whole degree. This is what the range bearing would have been if the compass had no deviation. (These are illustrative values; they will be different for your boat.)

The first and last columns of this table now constitute a deviation table for Water Witch provided no changes are made in the magnetic environment of the compass; see Table 13-5C. Note also that the table’s deviations are in terms of compass headings. These are not, of course, the same as magnetic headings; when on a heading of 090° magnetic the boat’s bow points in a direction quite different from when she heads 090° by compass. This leads to a problem. The skipper determines from the chart his magnetic course; he then wants to know what deviation to apply to get the compass course he should steer. Use of Table 13-5C for that purpose requires time-consuming trial-and-error steps. To avoid this, he makes a second table listing the deviations in terms of magnetic headings; refer to Table 13-3. This can be done by trial and error. Deviation can also be determined by using a GPS receiver. See this page.

Table 13-5C The third step is to determine the difference between each range bearing (column 2) and the calculated magnetic bearing (column 3). This difference, entered in column 4, is the deviation. If the compass bearing is larger than the magnetic bearing, the deviation is west; if it is smaller, the deviation is east. From this table, another table in terms of magnetic headings can be calculated; refer to Table 13-3.

## COMPENSATION

It can be assumed that a boat’s compass will have deviation errors. The area available for a control station on most craft, especially motorboats, is so limited that it is impossible to have magnetically undesirable objects at a safe distance from the compass. It is possible to live with known values of deviation provided they are not too large—deviations much over about 6 degrees can cause trouble in rough waters. It is, however, much better if the compass is compensated (also referred to as adjusted) so that the deviation is reduced to zero, or nearly so, on as many headings as possible. This procedure is within the capabilities of the average skipper.

See this page for a convenient and accurate variation on these procedures using GPS. See this page if your craft is made of steel.

#### Two Methods

Two basic techniques are used to adjust compasses; both use one or two pairs of small compensating magnets. In one instance the magnets are internal to the compass case or binnacle; in the other they are external and are mounted near the compass location. The objective of both methods is the same—to provide weak magnetic fields that cancel out the disturbing influences.

Compensation consists of adjusting the effect of each of these magnets to achieve the counter-balances of their fields with the fields of the disturbing influences.

### Using Internal Compensators

Most modern boat compasses now have internal compensating magnets. The two magnets, or pairs of magnets, are installed at right angles to each other. Usually there are two slotted screw heads at the edge of the compass; one marked E-W, and the other N-S; refer to Figure 13-02. (If external magnets must be used, see this page.)

#### Preliminary Steps

As discussed on this page, the internal compensators should be at zero effect before the compensation procedures are begun. Check also that the line from the center of the compass through the lubber’s line is exactly parallel to your boat’s centerline (see this page). Select an object at least one-half mile (0.9 km) distant. With your boat held absolutely motionless, sight on that object both down the centerline and then over the compass; the sight lines should be the same.

Have a nonmagnetic screwdriver available to adjust the screws of the compensating magnets. (You can also use a dime or a piece of heavy sheet copper or brass, or a brass machine screw filed down to a flat point.)

Store each magnetic article of the boat’s gear in its regular place, put the windshield wiper blades in their normal “off” position, and keep no magnetic material near the compass. Steel eyeglass frames, steel partial dentures, or even the steel grommet in a yachting cap, if brought within a few inches of the compass, might cause deviation; someone may be working that close to the compass during adjustment.

Disposable Buoys Several disposable buoys will be needed. Excellent ones can be made of cardboard milk cartons or plastic bleach bottles ballasted with some sand or dirt. Newspapers wadded into a ball about the size of a basketball and tied with string will work if they are weighted with a small heavy object such as a large bolt or old spark plug at the end of three or four feet (0.9–1.2 m) of string; wire or rope should not be used for such a buoy; see Figure 13-21.

Figure 13-21 A disposable buoy for use in maneuvering to determine compass deviation can be made from either a ballasted plastic container or a ball of wadded newspapers attached to a small weight. All such buoys should be picked up and properly disposed of after the operation is completed.

#### Running Reciprocal Courses

The essential element of compensating a compass by running reciprocal courses is achieving accurate reversal, putting and holding the boat on a course over the bottom that is exactly the reciprocal of the original unknown magnetic heading. This is not as difficult as might be expected.

Establishing the Courses Between any two visible marks, or on a range, reversing the magnetic heading is obviously easy. In the procedures of compensation, however, there is need to run at least the four cardinal magnetic directions: East and West, North and South. Seldom will you find in your local waters natural marks or aids to navigation on these exact magnetic headings. If you are fortunate, you may find special ranges on these headings that have been established for compass adjustment purposes. More likely, though, you must make your own temporary basic courses.

The basic technique is quite simple—departing from a fixed mark (a buoy will do, but a daybeacon or light is better), run on a steady compass heading until ready to reverse your course. Drop a disposable buoy creating the desired range. (With many high-speed craft, the path through the water may be distinctive enough that a marker will not be required.) Next, execute a “buttonhook” turn (known technically as a Williamson turn; Figure 12-07, this page)—line up the disposable buoy with the object marking the original departure point, steady on this range visually, and ignoring the compass, head for the initial point. Run down the disposable buoy, and continue back toward the departure point; see Figure 13-22. Make the turn as tightly as possible, keeping the buoy in sight, so as to complete the turn before the buoy has had time to drift from the spot at which it was dropped. Choose a right or left turn, whichever can be made tighter if there is any difference; swing enough to the opposite side before making the main turn so that when the main turn is completed, you can pick up the desired reciprocal course smoothly without overshooting and having to apply opposite rudder. This maneuver is not difficult to learn; all that is required is a few trials and then some practice. Under some circumstances, as discussed in Chapter 12, it is also the most accurate procedure for returning to the spot where a person or object has been lost overboard.

Figure 13-22 With a little practice a skipper can learn to make a buttonhook, or Williamson, turn of 180° and come back directly over the spot where the turn was started. Swing out far enough initially on the opposite side of the turn so that the reciprocal course can be picked up without overshooting it. (Sketch not to scale.)

This maneuver will put the boat accurately on a reciprocal course, providing that the buoy remained where it was dropped and that no wind or current set the boat to either side of her heading on the outward run from the starting point.

Compensation will be inaccurate if the boat has moved crabwise, heading one way but actually going another. The various courses of compass compensation procedures must therefore be run when wind and current conditions will produce no leeway.

The skipper who hesitates to run directly over the disposable buoy should take it very close alongside, touching it if possible. On a range of ½ nautical mile, when the buoy is 10 feet (3m) to one side of the boat’s centerline, the course error will be only 11′, less than ⅕ of a degree.

#### Compensation on Cardinal Headings

As noted above, compensation must be accomplished when wind and current will not set the boat to either side of the intended course; the winds and seas must also be such that accurate steering is possible. Adjustments are made first on the East-West cardinal headings.

#### East-West Adjustments

First steer 090° (or 270°) by compass from the chosen departure mark, holding rigorously to this course by the compass for at least a half mile; a mile would be better, but you must be able to see the starting mark. It makes no difference whether the initial run is toward the east or west; this can be determined by the available water area and object used for a departure mark. Have someone drop a disposable buoy over the stern, execute the turn described above, and run the reciprocal course; refer to Figure 13-22. Run this course not by the compass, but by heading for the original departure point. Read the compass and record the figures.

If the compass reading is now 270° (or 090°), there is no deviation on east or west headings and compensation is not needed; the E-W internal compensator should not be touched.

If the compass reading for a return to the starting point is not 270° (or 090°), compensation is required. Use your nonmagnetic screwdriver to remove half the difference between 270° (090°) and the observed reading. Halving the difference is based on the assumption that the deviation of reciprocal courses is equal and opposite. This may not be exactly so, but it serves as a good initial approach.

Assume, for example, that the compass reading was 290°; then one-half of the 20-degree difference, or 10 degrees, is to be removed while the reciprocal course is carefully run. Turn the E-W adjusting screw, and watch the compass closely. If the compass reading increases rather than decreases, the screw has been turned in the wrong direction (there is no way to tell in advance which is the correct direction); turn the screw in the opposite direction. Move the screw slowly until the compass reading is 280° while the boat is exactly on the reciprocal course.

Return to the starting mark and make another east-west run. Head out again on a compass course of 090° (or 270°), the track through the water will not be the same as for the first run; drop a new disposable buoy, turn, and line up for the reciprocal course back to the point of departure. If the compass reading is not now 270° (or 090°)—it should be close—again remove half the difference by turning the screw of the compensating magnets.

Repeat these east-west runs until the deviation is eliminated or reduced to the smallest possible amount on these headings. Do not touch the E-W adjusting screw again after it is finally set.

#### North-South Adjustments

Follow a similar procedure on north-south headings. Run from a starting point—it can be the same as for east-west runs, or it can be a different one as required by the available water area—on a compass heading of 000° (or 180°) by compass, drop a disposable buoy, make the turn, and head back visually toward the departure point. Remove half of the error by adjusting the screw marked N-S.

Repeat such runs as necessary, just as was done for the east-west compensation.

When the north-south compensation has been completed, make a quick check for any east-west deviation; it should not have changed, but it’s worth checking. The deviation on all cardinal headings should now be zero, or as near zero as is attainable in this boat.

#### Residuals on Intercardinal Headings

You can determine any deviations remaining on the intercardinal headings—NE, SE, SW, and NW—by any of the methods discussed earlier in this chapter, or you can estimate them by making reciprocal runs on these headings. In this method, the deviation will be half the difference between the outward course steered by compass and the reading of the compass when the turn has been made and the craft pointed back to the starting point. Be sure to note the direction of the deviation, east or west. Do not touch the N-S or E-W adjustment screws.

Intercardinal heading errors can be especially troublesome on craft with a steel hull, or if there is a larger mass of iron near the compass. In such situations, the services of a professional compass adjuster should be obtained.

### Failure to Achieve Compensation

When compensation cannot be achieved satisfactorily, you undoubtedly have an undetected magnetic field on your boat. Prime suspects include the steering mechanism and the engine throttles and shift levers. Test them with a thin machinist’s steel feeler gage a few thousandths of an inch thick (0.004 inch, or 0.1 mm, is ideal). Make sure the metal of the gauge is not magnetized.

Touch one end of the steel feeler gauge to the part being tested for magnetism and gently pull it away. If it tends to stick to the part, the latter is magnetized. Test all around thoroughly. Open the wheel housing or look under the instrument panel; test all metal parts found.

If a magnet is located, demagnetization will be required. You may need professional advice and assistance, but try your own hand at the job first, using the procedures on this page.

### The Final Deviation Table

When the compass has been adjusted to the greatest possible extent, make a complete deviation check and prepare a table for any deviations found; use any of the methods described earlier.

Make this check under all conditions in which the compass might be used; check with the navigation lights on and off (they may be distant from the compass, but wires running to their switch will be nearby), with the windshield wipers operating and not operating, and with the depth sounder, radio, radar, and chartplotter each on and off, one at a time. Look also for other electrical equipment whose operation could affect the compass. Remember to check on two cardinal headings 90 degrees apart. Most of this equipment will not disturb the compass, but some could, and you must be aware of it. If any checked items have to be on when the compass is in use, you may need to have more than one deviation table. You may also sometimes have to turn on certain equipment, whether needed or not, to re-create the magnetic environment that existed when the deviation table was prepared. A sailboat may need different deviation tables for port and starboard tacks because of different heeling errors. If two or more deviation tables are necessary, it is a good idea to use different color paper for each.

Before preparing the final deviation table, plot a simple graph of the values to be used. Lay out a horizontal baseline for compass headings from 0° to 360°; plot easterly deviation vertically above the baseline and westerly deviations below that line at a suitable scale; see Figure 13-23. When all values of deviation have been plotted, draw a smooth curve through the points, but don’t expect all values to be exactly on that line, since the deviations have been measured only to the nearest whole degree. You should be able to get a smooth curve through or near all of the points; if any value lies significantly off the curve, it is probably in error and should be rechecked. If you can draw a smooth curve, but its center axis does not coincide with the horizontal base line for 0° deviation, the lubber’s line may be out of alignment; recheck carefully.

Figure 13-23 When you have all your data, and before making a final deviation table, make a simple plot of the values to spot any that are not consistent with the others. (Data deviations have been exaggerated for emphasis.)

The final deviation table can be alternatively prepared as a direct-reading table of critical values; see this page and Table 13-6. Whichever style of deviation table you choose to prepare, it can be used with confidence if care is taken to see that the magnetic environment is not altered. Check it each year, even though you think no changes have been made that would upset the deviation table.

Table 13-6 A deviation table—shown here in two formats—permits the conversion of directions from magnetic to compass, or from compass to magnetic. A conventional table, upper, requires interpolation to get values between the lines of data. For example: for a magnetic heading of 10°, the deviation lies between 7°E for 000° and 1°E for 015°; interpolation gives 3°E. With the critical values table, lower, you can go directly to the value needed; no interpolation is required. See this page. (Deviation values have been exaggerated for clarity; on an actual vessel, they would have been reduced by compensation.)

## COMPASS MAINTENANCE

In addition to protecting the instrument from direct sunlight when not in use, compass maintenance has two aspects. The first is the preservation of the magnetic environment that surrounds it. Except for occasional testing, no piece of iron or steel should be brought or installed near it, lest it cause unknown deviations. The second aspect of maintenance consists mainly of getting to know your compass. Watch how it swings. Check that its readings are consistent on frequently run courses. Note if it appears to become sluggish and above all if it becomes erratic—these conditions warn you of undetected disturbances or a damaged pivot bearing.

Test for a damaged bearing or undue pivot friction by deflecting the card two or three degrees with a small magnet or piece of iron. If the card does not return to its former position, the compass should be removed from the boat and taken to a reputable shop for tests and, probably, repair.

As mentioned, a bubble can be removed by adding some liquid, but the liquid must be the same as that with which the compass is filled. This is best left to a compass repair shop.

Lightning strikes on board or nearby may change the craft’s magnetic field; electric welding can have the same effect. After exposure to either of these, check deviations.

In northern waters, care should be taken that metal objects on the boat have not acquired a magnetic field over the winter storage period; a newly magnetized piece of metal could, of course, confuse the compass and require readjustment of the compensators or the making of a new deviation table.

Do read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions for winter storage if the boat is taken out of regular service. Doing so may add years to the compass’s useful life.

## ADVANCED COMPASS TOPICS

The following sections on various topics on magnetism and compasses are generally beyond the “need-to-know” of the average skipper. Some, however, will be of value to those with special problems, and many others will be of interest to those skippers who want to have a bit more than the minimum knowledge.

### Magnetism

Contrary to some popular ideas, the location of the earth’s magnetic poles is of little interest to the navigator. (Should he ever get to their vicinity, he would then have to rely for directional information on some instrument other than his magnetic compass.)

Variation is not the angle between the direction to the true and magnetic poles. This concept, a fictitious visualization useful in helping students to realize that true and magnetic north are usually different directions, has been accepted by many as truth. This must be recognized as merely a learning aid, not a factual representation. The magnetic pole does not control the compass. The controlling force is the earth’s magnetic field. The compass magnet does not necessarily point in the precise direction of the magnetic pole.

Actually, two specific points on the earth’s surface that are the magnetic poles do not exist. There are north and south magnetic polar areas containing many apparent magnetic poles, places where a dip needle would stand vertically. If this seems strange, consider the problem of pinpointing the precise point in the end of a bar magnet that is the pole.

For scientific purposes, approximate positions of the theoretical North and South Magnetic Poles have been computed from a large number of continuing observations made over the world for many years. They are not diametrically opposite each other as are the geographic poles. The magnetic poles do not stay in the same place. The north magnetic pole, for example, is moving approximately north-northwest at 30 nautical miles (55 km) per year, and in 2017 it was at 86.5°N, 172.6°W. The south magnetic pole was at 64.2°S, 136.2°W. A magnetic compass at 87°N, 172.6°W would show north in a direction truly southward of the compass.

Magnetic force lines dip downward toward a point far below the surface except near the equator, creating a dip error that increases with latitude. Compasses sold for use north of the equator are balanced to offset this error. Compasses balanced for use in southern latitudes will provide improved performance in these waters.

#### Isogonic Lines

On smaller scale charts covering larger areas, variation may be shown by isogonic lines; every point on such a line has the same variation. Each line is labeled with the amount and direction of variation and the date; see Figure 13-24. The line joining all points having zero variation is called the agonic line.

Figure 13-24 Offshore charts of large areas often show magnetic variation by a series of broken magenta lines for each degree of variation. Each such isogonic line is labeled with its variation and the year for which it applies.

#### Induced & Permanent Magnetism

Masses of iron or related metals that do not show any magnetic properties under usual conditions will acquire induced magnetism when brought near a magnet and into its field. The polarity of an induced pole is opposite to that of the nearest pole of the magnet that caused it. When the inducing field is removed, any magnetism that remains is termed residual. If the object retains magnetism for a long period of time without appreciable reduction in strength, this is permanent magnetism.

#### Magnetism from Electrical Circuits

Although the copper of electrical wires is nonmagnetic material, currents flowing in them produce magnetic fields. It is this effect that makes possible electrical motors, generators, relays, electromagnets, etc. A direct current in a wire results in a field that can affect a vessel’s compass. (Alternating-current electricity also produces magnetic fields, but not of the type to disturb a compass.) The polarity of a field around a wire carrying DC is related to the direction of the current, a fact that can be used to advantage. The two wires carrying power to any load have currents in the opposite directions, thus producing opposing fields. If these wires are twisted together, the field around one wire cancels out the field produced by the other, and the net effect on the compass will be zero, or nearly so.

Always use two wires, never use a common ground for return current, and always twist pairs of wires that pass near a compass. Don’t fail, however, also to make an actual check by observing the compass closely as the electrical circuit is switched on and off; make this test on two cardinal headings 90 degrees apart.

#### Demagnetization

If tests with a thin strip of steel (see this page) have shown that some metal object at the control station is magnetized, it may be possible to demagnetize it with a device used by electronic repair shops, such as a degaussing coil for TV sets or a magnetic-tape bulk eraser. If the magnetized object cannot be removed from the boat for undertaking this effort, it is mandatory that the compass be taken off lest the effectiveness of its magnets be destroyed.

The demagnetizing device is operated from 120-volt shore power; it uses alternating currents to produce magnetic fields that reverse at the 60 Hz frequency. Hold the device about a foot (0.3 m) from the target object and turn on the power; do not turn off the device until the full process has been carried out. Advance the demagnetizer slowly toward the object until it touches; move it around slowly over all the accessible surfaces of the object. Remove the device slowly away until it is at least the starting distance away and then turn it off. (If power to the demagnetizing device is interrupted at any time during the process, start over again and repeat all steps.) Take care not to demagnetize anything that is properly magnetic, such as electrical instruments or radio speakers.

Now test the disturbing object again with the thin strip of steel. If it has been possible to reach all of the object, it should be demagnetized. Often, however, complete access is not possible, and the object may have to be disassembled and/or removed from the boat for complete demagnetization.

After the demagnetization process is completed, remount the compass, and, in all cases, make an entirely new deviation table.

### Why Deviation Depends on the Boat’s Heading

Aboard a boat, the compass is subject to two magnetic forces: that of the earth and that of objects on the craft. If the boat were absolutely free of magnetism—no permanent magnets, no material subject to acquiring induced magnetism, and no fields from electrical currents—there would be no deviation on any heading; see Figure 13-25. The earth’s force depends upon geographic locations; the compasses of all vessels in the same harbor are subject to the same variation. The deviations aboard these ships and boats will be dissimilar because of the differences in the magnetic characteristics of each vessel. Thus if all of them put in identical magnetic headings, their compasses would differ, except in the remote circumstance that each compass was completely compensated.

Figure 13-25 If there are no magnetic disturbances on the boat to disturb its compass—which is rarely the case—there is no deviation on any heading.

deviation, it will be remembered, varies with the craft’s heading because of magnetic material on board. A few examples may make this clearer. Refer again to Figure 13-25, the nonmagnetic boat. No heading of this craft affects its compass card; its North point always lies on the magnetic meridian; the compass has no deviation. As the boat changes heading, the lubber’s line, turning with the bow, indicates the magnetic heading on the card.

Now put aboard the craft, in the vicinity of the compass, items such as radios, electronic depth sounders, electrical gauges, and other instruments. Also on the boat, but usually farther from the compass, are metallic masses such as anchors, chain, fuel and water tanks, and other magnetic items, including the engine (the engine is by far the largest mass of magnetizable material, but it is relatively distant from the compass). The boat has now acquired a magnetic character of its own; in addition to any permanent magnetism of some objects, there are now masses of unmagnetized material that can affect the compass by acquiring induced magnetism.

The effects on the compass of permanent magnetism and induced magnetism are different and must be considered separately.

#### Effect of Permanent Magnetism

On typical boats of wood or fiberglass, the effect of permanent magnetism is by far the greater. To visualize this, let us assume that the same net effect would be exerted by a single permanent magnet located aft of the compass and slightly askew of the boat’s centerline; see Figure 13-26. This representation by an imaginary magnet is quite applicable; it simulates conditions found on most boats other than those with a steel hull. (The exact position of the imaginary magnet, its polarity, strength, and angle of skew are not important in this illustration of principles.)

Figure 13-26 On a north magnetic heading, A, the S pole of the compass is repelled by the S pole of the imaginary magnet representing the net effect of all magnetic influences on the boat. The card is deflected counterclockwise; there is westerly deviation. On an east heading, B, the N pole of the compass is nearer the S pole of the imaginary magnet, and is attracted toward it. The deflection is still counterclockwise; the deviation is still westerly. On a south magnetic heading, C, the N pole of the compass is nearest the S pole of the imaginary magnet and is attracted to it. The card is deflected clockwise; the deviation is easterly. On an intermediate heading, D, the N pole of the compass is attracted to the S pole of the imaginary magnet, but is already as close to it as it can get. There is no deflection, and thus no deviation on this heading.

Two forces, that of the field of the earth and that of the field of the imaginary magnet, now affect the compass; its poles are attracted or repelled in accordance with the basic law of magnetism. Without the influence of the imaginary magnet, the compass magnets and card will line up with the magnet meridian. The 0° mark of the card is an N (north-seeking) pole, and the 180° mark is at an S pole. Now, in addition to the effect of the earth’s magnet poles on them, the N and S poles of the compass magnets will be attracted or repelled by the S pole of the imaginary magnet (the pole nearer the compass in these examples). The result is easterly deviation on some headings, westerly on others, and zero on those where the sign of the deviation changes from east to west, or from west to east.

Consider a typical boat, Morning Star, headed north (000°) magnetic; see Figure 13-26A. The S pole of the compass, 180° on the card, is repelled by the S pole of the imaginary magnet. The result is that the card is rotated counterclockwise; the compass reading is increased, 006° in this instance, and there is westerly deviation.

On a south magnetic heading, as in Figure 13-26C, the N pole of the compass magnet, 000° on the card, is nearer the S pole of the imaginary magnet and is attracted by it. The card is deflected clockwise and the compass reading decreases, to 174°, and deviation is easterly.

If the magnetic heading of Morning Star is to the east, as in Figure 13-26B, the N pole of the compass magnet is the nearer pole to the S pole of the imaginary magnet and it is attracted. This results in a counterclockwise rotation of the compass card, giving westerly deviation. On a west magnetic heading, the deflection of the card is clockwise, for easterly deviation. (It is a good exercise to diagram this situation for yourself.)

In the above examples, the deviation is westerly on an east magnetic heading, but easterly on a south magnetic heading. Thus there must be some intermediate heading where the deviation passes through zero as the sign changes from west to east. This situation is approximated in Figure 13-26D. There is still attraction of the N pole of the compass by the S pole of the imaginary magnet, but on this heading the compass card has its N pole as close to the S pole of the magnet as it can get. Thus there is no deflection of the card in either direction, no deviation.

As has been illustrated above, deviation resulting from permanent magnetism will normally swing through one cycle of west to east and back to west in 360°, with two headings having zero deviation.

Do not assume that the location, polarity, and angle of skew of the imaginary magnet would be the same on any other boat as in the above examples, which are for the sole purpose of illustrating principles. A change of one or more of these factors would result in an entirely different set of deviations.

#### Effect of Induced Magnetism

The effect of induced magnetism on a compass can be visualized in a series of examples much like the above with an imaginary mass of magnetizable material. In this case, the disturbing pole would be the one induced in that mass, and its sign would change as determined by the changing sign of the nearer pole of the inducing magnet. The sign of the deviation would change four times in 360 degrees, with four headings having zero deviation.

If the effects of permanent and induced magnetism are combined, a complex situation results; fortunately, this is unlikely for most small craft.

### Effect of Geographic Position

Deviation can change with changes in magnetic latitude of a vessel. The strengths of most magnetic influences on a boat are unchanged at different geographic positions, but the horizontal component of the earth’s field lessens in higher latitudes. Hence the interaction of these two forces, the cause of deviation, changes with significant change in magnetic latitude.

### Compass Calculations

Compass error (ce) is sometimes used in compass calculations as a specific term. It is the algebraic sum of the variation and deviation. Because variation depends on geographic location, and the deviation upon the craft’s heading, there are various possible combinations of these two quantities; refer to Figure 13-17. Similarly to variation and deviation, it is expressed in degrees and direction, for example 5°E or 7°W; in boating, it is given to the nearest whole degree.

This is a term used for convenience. The compass is not actually in error; it is operating according to the forces that control its behavior. Compass error is merely the angle between true north and compass north.

#### Interpolation

The process of determining intermediate values between tabular entries is called interpolation. It is most easily explained by several examples. Consider the following extract from a deviation table:

Compass Heading

Deviation

090°

7°E

105°

4°E

Assume that we need the deviation for a compass heading of 100°. The interval between tabular entries is 15 degrees; the difference between deviation values is 3 degrees. Since 100° is 10/15 of the way between 090° and 105°, we multiply the value difference by that fraction: 3° x 10/15 = 2°. Since the deviation is decreasing, this is subtracted: 7°E − 2° = 5°E, the deviation for 100°.

If the values are not so even as above, an answer with a fraction will result. If we had desired the deviation for 098°, the fraction would have been 8/15, and the result 3° x 8/15 = 1.6°; then 7° − 1.6 = 5.4°E; but for boat use deviation is not used more precisely than the nearest whole degree and thus the deviation for 098° would be recorded and used as 5°E. If the fractional value is 0.5°, use the nearest even, not odd, degree.

Caution must be used when the two values of deviation are of opposite name. The value difference between 3°W and 1°E is four degrees, not two.

### Critical Values Tables

A skipper will need deviation values in terms of both compass headings (for correcting calculations) and magnetic headings (for uncorrecting). A simple way to combine both of these, and have an easier-to-use table as well, is to prepare a direct-reading table of critical values. Such a table is prepared in basic terms of deviations rather than headings. There is a line in the table for each whole degree of deviation; opposite this is listed on one side the range of compass headings for which that value of deviation is applicable; on the other side is the range of magnetic headings that have that value of deviation. See the below partial example and Table 13-6, where different numbers are used.

Magnetic

133°-145°

145°-153°

164°-176°

163°-174°

177°-187°

4°E

175°-185°

### Special Compensation Situations

The procedures of compensation described earlier in this chapter will fit most, but not all, recreational boats and their compasses. Special situations are discussed next.

#### Using External Magnets

If the boat’s compass (or binnacle) does not have internal compensating magnets, it still can be adjusted to near zero deviation if there is space to place external magnets where they are needed.

Two compensating magnets will be needed. Each is an encased permanent magnet having two holes in the case for screw fastening. The ends of the magnets will either be marked N and S or be colored red on the north end and blue on the south. Masking tape is good for temporary fastening; be sure that the screws used for final fastening are nonmagnetic. Carefully mark the longitudinal center of each magnet. In the areas where the external magnets will be placed, carefully mark out in chalk two lines through the compass center, one for fore-and-aft and one athwartships; see Figure 13-27.

Figure 13-27 Before installing external compensating magnets, chalk in two lines, shown in red above, through the center of the compass mounting location. The magnets must always be placed so that their centers are on one of these lines. Magnets are placed forward or aft of the compass and on one side, above right. When final placement has been determined, they are fastened down with nonmagnetic tacks or screws.

General Procedures The compensation process consists of making outward runs on cardinal headings by compass, dropping a disposable buoy, turning, and heading back toward the point of departure. All this is done in the same manner as was done for internal compensators. Keep all external magnets far from the compass until each one is to be used.

Adjustment on E-W Headings If compensation is shown to be needed—for example, the compass reads 290° on the reciprocal of a 090° outward run—the correction is made by placing an external compensating magnet in a fore-and-aft position centered on an athwartship chalked line. This can be placed on either side of the compass in position A or A′ of Figure 13-27, right. Should the compass reading now become more than 290°, the compensation is increasing the deviation; move the magnet to the other side of the compass or turn it end-for-end (but don’t do both). The card will then move in the desired direction, toward 270°.

Should the card stop moving before 280° (the reading for removal of half of the error), the compensator, in a position such as at D, is too far from the compass. On the other hand, if the card moves past 280°, the compensator is too close to the compass, as at C, and must be moved farther away. Move the external magnet closer to or farther from the compass until the desired reading is attained. Now tape the compensator down—no screws yet. Do not let it get off the centerline as at E. As with internal compensators, a second E-W run is then made, or perhaps more, until zero deviation is achieved.

Adjustments on N-S Headings After the turn back on a north or south run, one-half of any deviation is adjusted out by placing a compensator in an athwartship position centered on the fore-and-aft line, such as at B in Figure 13-27, right. If there is no room for the magnet in front of the compass, place it aft of the instrument in the vicinity of B′. Move it closer to the compass or farther away—and reverse ends if needed—in the same manner as on east-west runs.

When, after sufficient runs, the deviation is zero, or reduced to a minimum, screw down the magnets (remember, nonmagnetic screws) with care that their position is not shifted. It is wise to make one more E-W and then N-S run after the magnets have been secured in place as a final test of your work.

### Compensation by Shadow Pin

A method of sailing reciprocal courses without setting up temporary ranges with disposable buoys uses a vertical shadow pin in the center of a horizontal disc graduated similar to a compass card; the disc should be gimbal mounted.

As the craft heads east (or west) by the compass, the disc is rotated by hand so that the shadow of the pin caused by the sun falls on the 090° (270°) mark. The turn is made and the boat is steadied on such a heading that the shadow falls on the opposite side of the disc, exactly on the 270° (090°) mark. If the compass now reads 270° (090°), there is no deviation on E-W headings. If not 270° (090°), the previously described procedures are followed for adjustment. A similar technique is used for N-S headings.

This procedure has advantages. The boat need not run far on any heading. No departure mark or disposable buoy is required. Neither the wind nor current will affect the result. But there is one complicating factor—the sun and its shadow do not stand still. Regardless of how steady the boat is being held on a heading, the shadow is moving. Time becomes a factor in the execution of the procedure; compensators must be adjusted before the shadow moves enough to upset the process, taking the boat off a true reciprocal heading.

### Compensation on Sailboats

Sailing craft, heeling out of a horizontal trim, frequently require heeling magnets below the compass to reduce their deviation. Small-craft skippers can make a rough compensation, but an exact adjustment is a job for a professional compass adjuster.

Place your sailboat on a N-S heading and heel her slightly, maintaining a constant heading. Place a correction magnet vertically under the compass so as to eliminate only the deviation induced by heeling; reverse the ends of the magnet if necessary. Even if you are unable to make this adjustment, try heeling your sailboat to see the effect on your compass.

### Compensation on Steel Boats

Steel hulls may present problems whose solution may require installation of soft iron quadrantal spheres; see Figure 13-28. Another solution might be the use of flinders bars, or possibly heeling magnets. All this is for the professional adjuster or for the skipper who has achieved professional competence.

Figure 13-28 Vessels, including boats, with steel hulls present special cases for compass compensation. It will normally be necessary to mount two quadrantal spheres of soft iron on the binnacle and then adjust them very carefully—this is work for a professional compass adjuster.

Iron and steel vessels are subject to changes in deviation upon large changes in latitude. This must be considered when cruising in such craft.

## OTHER INSTRUMENTS

Several other direction instruments will be of general interest to boatmen, although few skippers will have more than one or two of them.

### Hand-Bearing Compass

A small compass (some equipped with a handle) designed to be easily held in front of one’s face is termed a hand-bearing compass; see Chapter 16, this page. This instrument is normally used for taking bearings, especially those that cannot be conveniently sighted across the steering compass.

A more sophisticated (and more expensive) hand-bearing compass combines a 5 x 30 monocular, a digital compass, an electronic rangefinder, and a chronometer in a single lightweight, handheld instrument. It can show the distance to an object as well as its compass bearing and the time of the observation; up to nine bearings can be recorded with the push of a button.

In an emergency, a hand-bearing compass can be used for steering the boat.

### Tell-Tale Compass

A tell-tale compass is one located belowdecks, usually overhead above the skipper’s bunk. These go back to the days when the captain used one to keep an eye on the course steered when he was not on deck. Today, they can serve the same purpose on long passages, but the more likely use is to watch out for wind and current shifts when riding at anchor for the night.

A tell-tale compass is an ordinary magnetic compass built upside-down so that the bottom of the card can be read. Some models have markings on both sides of their cards so that they can be used equally well in normal fashion or inverted as a tell-tale mounted overhead.

### Pelorus

A pelorus is an instrument having sight vanes and a compass-like card, either of which can be clamped in a fixed position. Sometimes referred to as a dumb compass, it is used to take bearings when it is not possible to do so across the steering compass. The pelorus is placed in a location suitable for observation; its zero point is adjusted to either compass North or the boat’s current heading, depending upon whether compass or relative bearings are desired.

### Gyrocompass

Ships and the largest of yachts will normally be fitted with a gyrocompass, a complex device that senses changes in the direction of the vessel. One type of gyrocompass holds a preset orientation, but gradually drifts off; it is independent of the earth’s magnetic field. Another, more complex type orients itself with respect to the earth’s rotation. This is the ultimate device for measuring direction at sea, yielding true rather than magnetic directions. Such units, however, are generally too large and expensive for small craft. But even gyrocompasses are not perfect; they must occasionally be reset, and adjustments are required for changes in latitude. Interested readers are referred to Publication No. 9—Bowditch—of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or to Dutton’s Nautical Navigation, published by the U.S. Naval Institute.

### GPS Compass

The signals that GPS receivers use to determine position can also be used by a gps compass (also called a satellite compass) to determine the heading of a vessel. This can be done whether or not the vessel is underway. Ordinary GPS receivers can display course made good (also called course over the ground), but this is not the same as an instantaneous heading and cannot be determined when the vessel is stationary.

In a satellite compass, two or more GPS antennas are mounted on a fixed baseline, either in a small dome or in the open. The GPS signals from satellites arrive at these antennas at the same time only for a specific orientation; at other times, there is a difference in the phase of the signals. Sophisticated computer technology uses the phase difference to determine the direction that the signals are coming from, and hence the heading of the vessel. As only phase information is used, these signals need not be differentially corrected. Three-axis solid-state gyro rate sensors ensure the continuity of heading information during periods of signal dropout for any reason, such as passing under a bridge. Some models use a third GPS antenna to reduce the negative effects of vessel motion in pitch, roll, and yaw. Headings are displayed to tenths of a degree; accuracy is typically better than 0.5°. The output of a GPS compass is in true headings; these can be changed to magnetic values by the introduction of variation information.

GPS compasses are not affected by the vessel’s speed, acceleration, latitude, or magnetic conditions on board. The heading information can be used by autopilots, course plotters, and radar displays. GPS compasses also provide the output information of an ordinary GPS receiver, and benefit from having multiple sources of data.

##### HIGH-TECH COMPENSATION-USING GPS FIXES

If your craft is equipped with a GPS receiver and you have access to a body of water that will permit straight runs of a mile or two on cardinal headings, you can adjust your compass for deviation using the following procedures.

1. Select a starting point and establish that as a GPS fix; designate this as Waypoint “A.”

2. From “A” run 090° (or 270°) by your magnetic compass for a distance of about one mile if you are using GPS readings corrected by ground or satellite signals. If you are not using differential corrections, make your run about two miles long. Most GPS receiver models now are accurate to within a few yards or meters.

3. At the end of this run, record your GPS position as Waypoint “B”; drop a disposable marker, if necessary, and make a sharp turnaround (see this page). Read from your GPS display the magnetic bearing of Waypoint “A”; if this is not 180° from your outbound compass course, adjust the E-W compass compensator to remove one-half of the difference. Using the direction of “A” (GPS bearing), make the run back to “A”; an autopilot can be used if available. Do not use course-made-good (course-over-the-ground) information from the GPS receiver; it will not give as good results as using GPS bearings to established waypoints.

4. At “A,” turn around and read from your GPS the bearing of “B”; if your compass does not read the same as the GPS bearing, again use the compass compensator to remove one-half of the difference.

5. It should not be necessary to repeat the above steps to eliminate the E-W deviation error, or reduce it to the minimum possible, but a similar second run can be done as a check.

6. Follow similar procedures to eliminate, or reduce to a minimum, the N-S deviation.

7. Follow Steps 1 through 3 on intercardinal points—NE, SE, SW, NW (in any sequence) to measure the deviation—the difference between the GPS bearing and the compass reading. Do not change the compensators; record the deviation. If deviation is greater than 3°, consult a professional compass adjuster.

It will be noted that the above procedures are much like those described on this page but do not require physical objects for steering objectives. Other actions, such as aligning the compass with the craft’s centerline, temporarily fastening it down, and permanently securing it in place, are the same with this procedure as covered earlier.

# CHAPTER14

Figure 14-01 Buoys, daybeacons, and minor lights all follow a systematic pattern of shapes and colors, whereas primary lights, such as lighthouses, are more distinctive and diverse.

AIDS TO NAVIGATION

Buoys • Daybeacons • Lights of All Sizes & Types • Sound Signals Ranges & Directional Lights—All Vitally Necessary for Safe Navigation

Unlike the roads and highways that we drive on, the waterways we go boating on do not have road signs that tell us our location, the route or distance to a destination, or of hazards along the way. Instead, the waterways have aids to navigation, all those man-made objects used by mariners to determine position or a safe course. These aids also assist mariners in making landfalls, mark isolated dangers, enable pilots to follow channels, and provide a continuous chain of charted marks for precise piloting in coastal waters. An aid-to-navigation system is designed and intended to be used with a nautical chart. The exact meaning of an aid may not be clear to a navigator unless the appropriate chart is consulted, as the chart illustrates the relationship of the individual aid to channel limits, obstructions, hazards to navigation, and to the total aids to navigation system.

The term “aid to navigation” includes buoys, daybeacons, lights, lightships, radiobeacons, and sound signals. (The United States no longer has any lightships, marine radiobeacons, or a Loran system, but these may be found in some foreign waters.) Also included are the Global Positioning System (GPS) and other electronic systems that are covered in Chapter 16. The term covers all the visible, audible, and electronic signals that are established by government and private authorities for piloting purposes. The U.S. Coast Guard uses the acronym ATON.

Note that the term navigation aid is far broader, including charts, instruments, and methods that assist in marine navigation.

Aids to navigation are shown on the appropriate charts. Good piloting starts with the ability to correlate what appears on the charts with what you see on the water.

Aids established by the federal government are placed only where the amount of traffic justifies their initial cost and continuing maintenance. Within bounds of necessity and cost, each aid is designed to be seen or heard over the greatest possible area.

### Operating Agencies

The U.S. Coast Guard is the agency responsible for maintaining aids to navigation on U.S. waters that are under federal jurisdiction or that serve the needs of the U.S. armed forces. Each Coast Guard District has supply and buoy depots, and special vessels for maintaining the aids.

#### State-Maintained Aids

On bodies of water wholly within the boundaries of a single state and not navigable to the sea, the state is responsible for establishing and maintaining aids to navigation.

Although each state keeps authority over its waters, a uniform system of aids and regulatory markers was established (see this page), but this has now been phased out in favor of aids conforming to the system used in coastal waters.

#### “Private” Aids to Navigation

With prior approval, aids may be established in federal waters by individuals or agencies other than the Coast Guard. Commercial, naval, scientific, sporting, or other private organizations may establish aids for their own specific purposes. These might consist of such diverse activities as lights on loading docks, data-gathering devices for oceanographers, or racing marks for regattas. These private aids must be patterned after federal aids, and any fixed structure planned for navigable waters requires a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers. See any USCG District Headquarters for details and procedures.

All such aids to navigation—whether established by an individual, a corporation, a state or local government, or even a federal agency other than the Coast Guard, such as the Navy—are private aids. They must have the same appearance as Coast Guard–maintained aids but are specially designated in the Light Lists; see this page.

### Protection by Law

Whether or not established by the Coast Guard, all aids to navigation are protected by law. It is a criminal offense to cause any damage or hindrance to the proper operation of any aid. Do not deface, alter, move, or destroy any aid to navigation. Never make your boat fast to a buoy, daybeacon, or light structure. Avoid anchoring so close to a buoy that you obscure the aid from sight of passing vessels. If you should unintentionally or unavoidably collide with or damage an aid to navigation, report the fact to the nearest Coast Guard unit without delay.

Suggestions for improvements to aids to navigation should be submitted in writing to the Commander of the Coast Guard District concerned; see Appendix C.

## TYPES OF AIDS TO NAVIGATION

The term “aid to navigation” encompasses a wide range of floating and fixed objects (“fixed” meaning attached to the bottom or shore), ranging from a small buoy or a single pile of wood, concrete, or metal with a sign, to lighthouses with an array of visible, audible, and electronic signals. Informal aids such as bush stakes marking natural channels or hazards in a creek are not a part of the organized system of aids to navigation.

Prominent buildings, cupolas, smokestacks, and other structures ashore, as well as unique land features, also can be used as signposts for navigation. These are landmarks, as distinguished from aids established solely for navigation.

### Major Types

Buoys are floating objects—other than lightships—that are anchored to the bottom as aids to navigation. They have distinctive shapes and colors as determined by location and purpose, and may have visual, audible, and/or electronic signals; see this page.

Beacons are structures that are permanently fixed to the earth’s surface, on shore or in the water; they may be of any size, from a lighthouse to a single pile. Lighted beacons are called lights; unlighted beacons are called daybeacons.

Beacons are equipped with one or more daymarks of a distinctive shape and color for daytime identification. Lights are classified by the U.S. Coast Guard and other authorities as primary seacoast lights, secondary lights, or minor lights, as determined by their location, importance, and physical characteristics. A light’s range and intensity vary with its classification. The shape and color of its supporting structure may be distinctive to identify it, but these characteristics do not convey information as they do for buoys. The term lighthouse is often applied to primary seacoast lights and to some secondary lights; see Figure 14-01.

Sound Signals are audible signals to assist mariners during periods of low visibility. They may be stand-alone aids but are generally part of a buoy, light, or other aid to navigation.

Ranges are pairs of unlighted or lighted fixed aids that, when observed in line, show the pilot to be on the centerline of a channel. The front aid of a pair may also serve to mark a turn in a channel.

Lightships are specially equipped vessels anchored at specific locations to serve as aids to navigation. They are of distinctive shape and color and have lights, sound signals, and radio-beacons. In U.S. waters, lightships have been replaced by permanent towers and large, specially equipped buoys, as explained later in this chapter.

Radiobeacons are transmitters broadcasting a characteristic signal specifically to aid navigation at night, in fog, or at distances exceeding normal visibility. These are usually with another aid, such as a major light, but may be separate. Marine radiobeacons are no longer operated along the U.S. coasts.

Radionavigation systems are radio transmitters ashore and on satellites that emit special signals for use in navigation. The systems include the now-ubiquitous Global Positioning System (GPS) operated by the Department of Defense, the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS), the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) under the FAA, and aeronautical radiobeacons and Omni stations run by the Federal Aviation Administration. There are also some private systems, but these will seldom be available to recreational boaters.

## BUOYS

Buoys are anchored to the bottom at specific locations, and are shown on charts by special symbols and lettering that indicate their shape, color, and visual and/or sound signals (if any). They vary widely in size. Buoys are anchored with chain to heavy concrete “sinkers” weighing up to six tons or more. The length of the chain will vary with the location, but may be as much as three times the depth of the water.

The buoyage system adopted for United States waters consists of several different types of buoys, each kind designed to serve under definite conditions. Broadly speaking, all buoys serve as daytime aids; many have lights and/or sound signals so that they may be used at night and in periods of poor visibility.

A buoy’s shape, color, and light characteristics, if any, give a navigator information about his location and the safe guidance of his vessel. A buoy’s size is usually determined by the importance of the waterway and size of vessels using it, and the distance at which the buoy must be seen.

### Buoy Characteristics

Buoys may be unlighted or lighted, sound buoys, or combination buoys (having both an audible and a visual signal). The Coast Guard maintains about 20,000 unlighted and 4,100 lighted and combination buoys in waters under its jurisdiction. Additional buoys are maintained by state and private agencies in nonfederal waters.

#### Buoy Shapes

Unlighted buoys may be further classified by their shape.

Can buoys have a cylindrical above-water appearance, like a can or drum floating with its axis vertical and one flat end upward; see Figure 14-02. Two lifting lugs may project slightly above the flat top of a can buoy, but they do not significantly alter its appearance.

Figure 14-02 A can buoy is cylindrical in shape with its long axis vertical. On this buoy, the upper part is made of metal plates at right angles to each other, making it an excellent radar reflector. Most, but not all, can buoys are constructed in this manner.

Nun buoys have an above-water appearance like that of a cylinder topped with a cone, pointed end up; see Figure 14-03. The cone may come to a point or be slightly rounded. Smaller nun buoys have a single lifting ring at the top; larger buoys have several lugs around the sides.

Figure 14-03 A nun buoy is cylindrical up to just above the waterline; from there it tapers to form a conical top. The upper part of some nun buoys, as here, consists of metal plates at right angles to reflect radar signals. The lifting ring at the top of this buoy (viewed side-to in this photo) has no navigational significance.

Unlighted buoys come in standardized sizes; a nun’s above-water portion may vary from 30 inches (0.76 m) to 14 feet (4.27 m); can buoys range from roughly 18 inches (0.46 m) to nearly ten feet (3.05 m) above the waterline. Boaters should remember that a considerable portion of a buoy is underwater, so that it is actually much larger and heaver than would appear from casual observation. Some smaller buoys are now made of plastic materials.

Spherical buoys are used in the revised U.S. lateral system for information and regulatory purposes; see this page and this page.

Other buoys of special shapes will sometimes be found in use as markers, but these are not regular aids to navigation. The Coast Guard has now eliminated the use of spar buoys, but they may be used in some other nations or in private systems. They are usually large vertical logs, trimmed, shaped, and appropriately painted; they are anchored at one end by a chain.

Lighted, sound, and combination buoys are described by their visual and/or audible signals rather than by their shape, as discussed below; see Figure 14-04.

Figure 14-04 Buoys with lights or sound signals, or both, have no significant shape, although most will appear similar to the Winwah Bay sea buoy shown here. Lifting lugs are at the base of the superstructure. Note the topmark above the solar-powered light.

#### Sound Buoys

A separate category of unlighted buoys includes those with a characteristic sound signal to aid in their location in fog or other reduced visibility. Different sound signals are used to distinguish between different buoys that are within audible range of one another.

Bell buoys are steel floats surmounted by short skeleton towers in which a bell is mounted; see Figure 14-05. They are effective day and night, and especially in fog or other conditions of reduced visibility; their use is favored because of their moderate maintenance requirements. Bell buoys are operated by motion of the sea using four tappers, loosely hung externally around the bell. When the buoy rolls in waves, wakes, or ground swells, a single note is heard at irregular intervals. Bell buoys, and other types that require some sea motion to operate, are not normally used in sheltered waters; a horn buoy is used there instead if a fog signal is needed.

Figure 14-05 A bell buoy has four tappers that are outside the bell. These strike the bell, making similar sounds in an irregular pattern as the buoy rocks due to the motion of the sea.

Gong buoys are similar in construction to bell buoys, but they have multiple gongs instead of a single bell. They normally have four gongs of different tones, with one tapper for each gong. As the sea rocks the buoy, the tappers strike against their gongs, sounding four different notes in an irregular sequence.

Whistle buoys have a whistle sounded by compressed air that is produced by sea motion. Whistle buoys are thus used principally in open and exposed locations where a ground swell normally exists.

Horn buoys are rather infrequently used. They differ from whistle buoys in that they are electrically powered; they are placed where a sound signal is needed and sea motion cannot be depended upon.

#### Lighted Buoys

Buoys may be equipped with lights of various colors, intensities, and flashing characteristics (called rhythms). Colors and characteristics of the light convey specific information to the mariner. Intensity depends upon the distance at which the aid must be detected, as influenced by such factors as background lighting and normal atmospheric clarity.

Lighted buoys are metal floats with a battery-powered light atop a short skeleton tower; see Figure 14-06. Lighted buoys can operate for many months without servicing and have “daylight controls” that automatically turn the light on and off as darkness falls and lifts. The lights are powered by storage batteries that are kept charged by panels of solar cells near the top of the buoy.

Figure 14-06 A lighted buoy has a light at its top that flashes in one of several regular patterns. Power is obtained from a battery that is kept charged by a solar panel. Power-efficient light emitting diode (LED) arrays are replacing conventional incandescent lamps.

Lights on buoys may be red, green, white, or yellow according to the specific function of the buoy; the use of these colors is discussed later in this chapter; see this page.

#### Combination Buoys

Buoys with both a light and sound signal are designated combination buoys. Typical of these are lighted bell buoys, lighted gong buoys, and lighted whistle buoys. There will be only one type of sound signal on any buoy; see Figure 14-07.

Figure 14-07 This combination buoy has both a light and a whistle. The light is powered by solar cells at the top and a battery within the hull; the whistle is operated by the motion of the seas. The red-and-white vertical striping and red spherical topmark on this buoy indicate that it’s a safe-water mark; see this page.

#### Offshore Buoys

As a replacement for lightships and for use at important offshore locations, the U.S. Coast Guard developed large navigational buoys (LNBs). These aids—sometimes referred to as “super buoys”—were roughly 40 feet (12.2 m) in diameter with a superstructure rising to 30 feet (9.1 m) or more. Because of their high initial cost and considerably greater maintenance costs, however, LNBs have been replaced with exposed location buoys (ELBs). These are still quite large, being 9 feet (2.74 m) in diameter. ELBs are equipped with lights and sound signals as well as weather and electronic navigation devices. Power is supplied by batteries kept charged by solar cells and a generator powered by wave motion; see Figure 14-08.

Figure 14-08 Exposed location buoys (ELBs) are usually equipped with a RACON (radar transponder), light, and sound signal; some will have meteorological sensors. These typically have both solar and wave-actuated power sources.

#### Buoy Colors

Buoys may be of one solid color or have a combination of two colors in horizontal bands or vertical stripes. The colors used in the IALA system are red, green, yellow, white, and black. The specific application of colors is discussed later in this chapter in connection with the uses of various buoys.

#### Optical Reflectors

Almost all unlighted buoys are fitted with areas of reflective material to help boaters find them at night by using searchlights. The material may be red, green, white, or yellow in banding or patches, and it has the same significance as lights of these colors. White reflective material may be placed on the numbers or letters of lighted and unlighted buoys of all types.

#### Radar Reflectors

Many buoys have radar reflectors—vertical metal plates set at right angles to each other so as to greatly increase the echo returned to a radar receiver on a vessel. The plates are shaped and mounted to preserve the overall characteristic shape of an unlighted buoy or the general appearance of a lighted buoy; refer to Figures 14-04, 14-06, and 14-07.

### Light Rhythms

The lights on lighted buoys will generally flash in one of several specific rhythms, for these reasons:

• Flashing conserves the energy source within the buoy.

• A flashing light can be more easily detected against a background of other lights.

• The light can signal specific information during hours of darkness, such as the need for special caution at a certain point in a channel.

• Different flashing patterns can be used to distinguish clearly between buoys of similar functions that are within visible range of each other.

Flashing lights are those that come on for a single brief flash at regular intervals; the time of light is always less than the time of darkness. Coast Guard–maintained flashing buoys will flash their light not more than 30 times per minute; this is the more generally used characteristic. It is sometimes referred to as “slow flashing,” but this is not an official designation.

Quick flashing lights will flash not less than 60 times each minute. These buoys are used for special situations where they can be more quickly spotted and where particular attention to piloting is required.

Group flashing (2+1) lights show two brief flashes, a brief interval of darkness, a single brief flash, and then an interval of darkness of several seconds duration.

Morse code (A) flashing lights have a cycle of a short flash, and a brief dark interval, then a longer flash and a longer dark interval, repeated every eight seconds. This is the “dot-dash” of the letter “A” in Morse code.

The above light rhythms are shown diagrammatically in Figure 14-09. The period of a light is the time it takes to complete one full cycle of flash and dark interval, or flashes and dark intervals. A light described as “flashing 4 seconds” has a period of four seconds. One flash and one dark interval lasts just that long before the cycle is repeated. Three standard periods are used for flashing lights—intervals of 2.5, 4, and 6 seconds.

Figure 14-09 Characteristic light patterns identify buoys. They are named (as indicated in these schematic patterns) and identified on charts by abbreviations. One period is indicated by  (quick flashing is continuous and does not have a period).

The term characteristics as applied to a lighted aid to navigation includes the color as well as the rhythm, and may also cover physical features, such as nominal range.

##### CAUTIONS IN USING BUOYS

Do not count on floating aids always maintaining their precise charted positions or unerringly displaying their characteristics. The Coast Guard works constantly to keep aids on station and functioning properly, but obstacles to perfect performance are so great that complete reliability is impossible.

Buoys are heavily anchored but may shift, be carried away, or sunk by storms or ships. Heavy storms may also cause shoals to shift relative to their buoys.

Lighted buoys may malfunction and show no light, or show improper light characteristics. Audible signals on most buoys are operated by action of the sea, and may be silent in calm water, or they may fail to sound because of a broken mechanism.

A buoy does not maintain its position directly over its sinker, as it must have some scope on its anchor chain. Under the influences of current and wind, it swings in small circles around the sinker, which is the charted location. (See this page for the charting of buoys.) This swinging is unpredictable, and a boat attempting to pass too close risks collision with a yawing buoy. In extremely strong current, a buoy may even be pulled beneath the water surface.

Buoys may be temporarily removed for dredging operations, and/or in northern waters they may be discontinued for the winter or changed to special types in order to prevent damage or loss from ice floes. The Light Lists show dates for changes or for seasonal buoys, but these are only approximate and may be changed by weather or other conditions.

Temporary or permanent changes in buoys may be made between editions of charts. Keep informed of existing conditions through reading Notices to Mariners and/or Local Notices to Mariners—see this page.

All buoys (especially those in exposed locations) should, therefore, be regarded as warnings or guides, and not as infallible navigation marks. Whenever possible, navigate with bearings or angles on fixed aids or objects on shore (see Chapter 18), and by soundings, rather than by total reliance on buoys.

## DAYBEACONS

Daybeacons are unlighted aids that are fixed, rather than floating like buoys. They may be either on shore or in waters up to about 15 feet (4.6 m) deep.

Daybeacons vary greatly in design and construction, depending upon their location and the distance from which they must be seen. Daybeacons in U.S. waters, and their chart symbols, are illustrated in the ATON Light List plates on this page.

### Daybeacon Construction

The simplest daybeacon is a single pile with signboards, called dayboards, at or near its top, usually two, facing in opposite directions; see Figure 14-10. The pile may be wood, concrete, or metal.

Figure 14-10 Most daybeacons consist of a single pile with two square or triangular dayboards, corresponding to a can or a nun and marked with a number or number and letter. At some locations, such as channel junctions, where the daybeacon can be approached from more than two directions, there will be an additional dayboard.

A larger, more visible, and more sturdy daybeacon is the “three-pile dolphin” type: three piles a few feet apart at their lower ends, bound tightly together with wire cable at their tops. There are also some five-pile dolphins (four piles around one central pile.) The Coast Guard maintains approximately 10,000 daybeacons.

#### Dayboards

Dayboards usually bear identification in the form of a number, a letter, or a number plus a letter, and are normally either square or triangular, corresponding to can and nun buoys. Square dayboards are green with green reflective borders. Triangular dayboards are red with red reflective borders. Rectangular dayboards are used in range marks as well. In special applications, a dayboard may be octagonal (eight-sided) or diamond shaped, carrying a brief warning or notice.

Dayboards used as marks in the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) display unique square, triangular, or horizontal-band yellow symbols to distinguish them from aids marking other waters.

### The Uses of Daybeacons

For obvious reasons, daybeacons are restricted to relatively shallow waters. Within this limitation, however, a daybeacon is often more desirable than a buoy because it is firmly fixed in position and taller, thus easier to see and identify. Daybeacons also require less maintenance than buoys.

Daybeacons are used primarily for channel marking, and they serve in the same manner as buoys in the buoyage systems to be described later in this chapter.

## MINOR LIGHTS

Just as daybeacons are sometimes substituted for unlighted buoys, so may lighted buoys be replaced with minor lights. These are fixed structures of the same overall physical features as daybeacons, but equipped with a light generally similar in characteristics to those found on buoys; see Figure 14-11. Most minor lights are part of a series marking a channel, river, or harbor; also included, however, are some isolated single lights if they are of the same general size and characteristics. The term “minor light” does not include the more important lights marking harbors, peninsulas, major shoals, etc.; these have lights of greater intensity and/or special characteristics—these are designated as “secondary” or “primary seacoast” lights and are discussed in detail later in this chapter.

Figure 14-11 Most minor lights are little more than a daybeacon to which has been added a light, with its battery box and solar panels. The minor light seen here has a more elaborate structure and has three dayboards.

### Features of Minor Lights

Minor lights are placed on single piles, on multiple-pile dolphins, or on other structures in the water, or on shore; see Figure 14-11. Minor lights carry dayboards for identification, and reflective material for nighttime safety should the light be extinguished.

#### Light Characteristics

A minor light normally has the same color and flashes with the same phase characteristics as a lighted buoy; refer to Figure 14-09. Intensity will generally approximate that of a lighted buoy, but visibility may be increased by its greater height above water and its more stable platform. A combination of storage batteries and solar cells is used in the same manner as on lighted buoys.

#### Sound Signals

Minor lights may, in some locations, have an audible sound signal—an electrically operated horn or siren. In some cases, the signal operates continuously for months when reduced visibility conditions can be expected.

## BUOYAGE SYSTEMS

Most maritime nations use either a lateral system of buoyage or a cardinal system, or both. In the lateral system, the buoys indicate the direction to a danger relative to the course that should be followed. In the cardinal system, characteristics of buoys indicate location of the danger relative to the buoy itself; see Figure 14-13. The term “cardinal” relates to the cardinal points of the compass; see this page.

Figure 14-12 An articulated light is a rigid, buoyant structure fixed (with an articulated coupling) to the seabed. It provides a more precise location than an anchored lighted buoy. Without the light, it would be an articulated daybeacon.

Figure 14-13 Cardinal marks indicate that the navigable water lies to the named side of the mark—i.e., to the north of the north mark, to the east of the east mark, etc. The marks are distinguished from one another by their color banding and topmarks. If lighted, the color is white.

### The IALA Systems of Aids to Navigation

The International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (formerly the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities and still known as the IALA) had the goal of establishing a single global system of aids to navigation, but was unable to do so and had to settle for two regional systems. These systems have many identical characteristics, but also one fundamental difference—the colors used for the lateral marks. Both systems have provisions for the use of topmarks; these are small shapes, such as spheres and triangles, placed atop the buoy.

#### The IALA-B System

The full name is “System B—The Combined Cardinal and Lateral System (Red to Starboard).” System Β uses five types of “marks”—those of lateral and cardinal systems, plus three different marks for isolated dangers and safe waters, and for special indications. These are all of a designated design, but may vary in size. Nations using this system must use aids conforming to the basic designs, but need not use all types. As indicated by the title, lateral marks on the starboard side of channels entering from the open sea are colored red, with the port side being marked by green aids. Table 14-1 summarizes the IALA-Β System.

Table 14-1 This table summarizes the color numbering, shape, and lights or buoys used in the IALA-B system of buoyage. Be aware of the “clockwise direction” rule in the coastal waters of the United States, see text.

The IALA-Β system is used in the Western Hemisphere, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines.

##### THE IALA-A SYSTEM OF AIDS TO NAVIGATION

The IALA-A system uses the same cardinal marks, isolated danger marks, safe water marks, and special marks as the IALA-Β system. The difference is that the lateral marks are directly opposite in color—marks left to starboard when entering from the sea are colored green, those on the port side are colored red. The shapes of the lateral marks are the same in both systems; only the color is different.

The IALA-A system is used in all waters worldwide that are not covered by the IALA-Β system. This, of course, includes European, African, and nearly all Asian waters.

### The U.S. Aids to Navigation System

The United States has long used a “lateral system” of buoyage; this has now been converted to conform, as noted above, to the colors and shapes established by the International Association of Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) for “System Β.” Wherever you travel in the navigable waters of the United States, Canada, and other countries of the Western Hemisphere, the basic system is the same; you needn’t learn a new system for new waters. (The IALA-A system is used in U.S. possessions west of the International Date Line and south of 10° North latitude; see sidebar.)

In the United States, the lateral system of buoyage is uniformly used in all federal-jurisdiction areas and on many other bodies of water where it can be applied. In this system, the shape, coloring, numbering, and light characteristics of buoys are determined by their position with respect to the navigable channel, natural or dredged, as such channels are entered and followed from seaward toward the head of navigation. This is termed the “conventional direction of buoyage.”

Since not all channels lead or appear to lead from seaward, certain arbitrary assumptions are used in order that the lateral system may be consistently applied. In coloring and numbering offshore buoys along the coasts, the following system has been adopted: proceeding in a southerly direction along the Atlantic Coast, in a northerly then westerly direction along the Gulf Coast, and in a northerly direction along the Pacific Coast will be considered the same as coming in from seaward. This can be remembered as proceeding around the coastline of the United States in a clockwise direction.

Thus there’s a very important exception to red-right and green-left. As noted above it occurs in the United States when a channel that appears to come from the sea has in fact been designated by the U.S. Coast Guard as part of the “clockwise direction” rule. It happens in coastal waters including rivers and especially in the Intracoastal Waterway. Many unexpected groundings have occurred because the navigator did not study the charts or does not understand the clockwise rule.

On the Great Lakes, offshore buoys are colored and numbered as proceeding from the outlet end of each lake toward its upper end. This will be generally westerly and northward on the lakes, except on Lake Michigan where it will be southward. Buoys marking channels into harbors are colored and numbered just as for channels leading into coastal ports from seaward.

On the Mississippi and Ohio rivers and their tributaries, characteristics of aids to navigation are determined as proceeding from seaward toward the head of navigation, although local terminology describes “left bank” and “right bank” as proceeding with the flow of the river.

Not all types of marks are used in all waters, but those that are used will conform to the IALA-B system with respect to shapes, colors, topmarks, and light color and rhythm (characteristic). The U.S. system does not use cardinal buoys, but does use safe-water buoys and a few isolated-danger buoys. The IALA-B system makes no mention of sound signals such as bells, gongs, or whistles on buoys, and the previous U.S. usage has not been changed. The U.S. system also includes daybeacons and lights on fixed structures, aids that are not covered by either IALA system.

The U.S. system of lateral aids to navigation is supplemented by nonlateral aids where appropriate; see Figure 14-14.

Figure 14-14 There are some circumstances in the IALA-B system where yellow buoys that have no lateral significance are used. Generally, these mark anchorages, exclusion areas, artificial reefs, and dumping grounds, etc.

#### Coloring

All buoys are painted distinctive colors to indicate on which side you should pass them, or to show their special purpose. In the lateral system the significance of colors is as described below; the traditional phrase “red, right, returning” helps in remembering the system.

Red buoys mark the starboard (“right”) side of a channel when entering (“returning”) from seaward, or a hazard that you must pass by keeping the buoy to starboard.

Green buoys mark the port (left) side of a channel when entering from seaward, or an obstruction that must be passed by keeping the buoy on the left hand.

Red-and-green horizontally banded buoys are used to mark the “preferred” channel (usually the major channel) at junctions, or hazards that you may pass on either side (but check your chart to be sure). If the topmost band is green, the preferred channel is with the buoy to port of your boat—it is treated as if it were a can buoy. If the topmost band is red, the preferred channel is with the buoy to starboard. (Note: When proceeding toward the sea, it may not be possible to pass such buoys safely on either side. This is particularly true in situations where you are following one channel downstream and another channel joins in from the side; see Figure 14-15. When such a buoy is spotted, be sure to consult the chart for the area.)

Figure 14-15 A junction buoy, painted with red and green bands, must be treated differently depending upon whether you are proceeding toward the sea or away from it. Upstream, either course is safe; downstream one course is dangerous.

Red-and-white vertically striped buoys are “safe-water marks”; they are used as offshore approach points (often called “sea buoys”) and to mark a fairway or midchannel. If lighted, there will be a single red spherical topmark above the light that is roughly one-fifth the diameter of the buoy. If unlighted, the buoy may be spherical or it may be similar in construction to a sound buoy and will have a red spherical topmark.

Red-and-black horizontally banded buoys are used to mark isolated dangers (those not along the side of a marked channel); the top band will be black and there will be two black spherical topmarks.

Note carefully that areas of color running horizontally are “bands”; if the areas are arranged vertically, they are “stripes.” These terms are used in other color combinations in the case of special-purpose buoys.

#### Shapes of Buoys

In the lateral system of buoyage, unlighted buoys have definite shape characteristics that indicate which side of the channel they mark. The ability to distinguish shapes is particularly essential when you first sight a buoy in line with the sun and can see only its silhouette, not its color.

Can buoys, painted green, mark the port (left) side of the channel when returning from seaward, or a hazard that you must pass by keeping the buoy to port.

Nun buoys, painted red, mark the starboard (right) side of channels, or hazards that must be passed by keeping the buoy to starboard.

Channel junction buoys may be of either can or nun shape as determined by which is the primary channel. If the buoy is a nun, the uppermost band is red; if the buoy is a can, the uppermost band is green; see Figure 14-15.

No special significance is to be attached to the shape of sound, lighted, or combination buoys. The purpose of these is indicated by their coloring, number, or the rhythm of the light. Special caution must be exercised when a buoy is first sighted under conditions that its color cannot be determined, such as when proceeding in a direction toward a sun low in the sky.

#### Numbering

Most buoys have “numbers,” which actually may be numbers, letters, or a number-letter combination to help you find and identify them on charts. In the lateral system, numbers serve as yet another indication of which side the buoy should be passed. The system is as follows:

Odd-numbered buoys mark the port (left) side of a channel leading in from seaward. In accordance with the rules stated above, these will be green buoys, cans if they are unlighted.

Even-numbered buoys mark the starboard (right) side of a channel; these will be red (nun) buoys or buoys with red lights.

Numbers increase from seaward and are kept in approximate sequence on the two sides of a channel by omitting numbers as appropriate if buoys are not uniformly placed in pairs. Occasionally, numbers will be omitted on longer stretches without buoys, to allow for possible later additions. Numbers followed by letters, such as “24A” and “24B,” are buoys added to a channel after the initial numbering system was established, and with the series not yet renumbered.

A buoy marking a wreck will often carry a number derived from the number of the buoy next downstream from it, preceded by the letters “WR.” Thus, a buoy marking a wreck on a channel’s left-hand side between buoys 17 and 19 would be “WR17A.” A wreck buoy not related to a channel may be designated by one or two letters relating to the name of the wrecked vessel or a geographic location.

Letters without numbers are sometimes used for red-and-white vertically striped buoys marking fairways or harbor entrances, and for green-and-red horizontally banded buoys.

Numbers followed by letters may be used on aids to navigation marking offshore dangers. For the buoy marked “1JR,” the number has the usual sequential significance and the letters “JR” indicate that it is off “Johnson Reef.”

#### Color of Lights

For all lighted buoys in the IALA-B lateral system, the following system of colors is used:

Green lights on buoys mark the left-hand side of a channel returning from seaward; these are on green odd-numbered buoys, or green-and-red horizontally banded buoys with the green band uppermost.

Red lights on buoys mark the right-hand side of a channel when entering from sea (red even-numbered buoys) or red-and-green horizontally banded buoys with the red band uppermost.

White lights in the IALA-B system are used only on safe-water marks with the Morse letter “A” rhythm, and on marks at isolated dangers with a group flashing (2) rhythm. (Some white lights remain in use on the Western Rivers—see this page—but will eventually be eliminated.)

Yellow lights are used only on special marks; the rhythm may vary, but usually is flashing or fixed.

#### Light Rhythms

Flashing lights are placed only on green or red buoys, or on special-purpose buoys.

Quick flashing lights are placed only on channel edge–marking green and red buoys; these are used to indicate that special caution in piloting is required, as at sharp turns or changes in the width of the waterway, or to mark hazards that must be passed only on one side.

Group flashing (2 + 1) lights are used only on buoys with red-and-green horizontal bands. These are the buoys at channel junctions and at obstructions that can be passed on either side.

Morse code “A” flashing lights are placed only on red-and-white vertically striped buoys that mark a fairway or midchannel; these are passed close-to on either side, and are always white.

Fixed lights show continuously; they are rarely used because of excessive power requirement as compared with flashing lights.

#### Daybeacons & Minor Lights

The lateral system of buoyage has been described in terms of unlighted and lighted buoys, but the descriptions apply fully to comparable daybeacons and minor lights.

Daybeacons with red triangular dayboards may be substituted for nun buoys, and ones with green square dayboards may replace can buoys. Minor lights may be used in place of lighted or combination buoys. Structures subject to being repeatedly struck by vessels may be set back from the channel edge, as noted in the Light List.

If a daybeacon is used to indicate the preferred channel at a junction or an obstruction, the dayboard will be red-and-green horizontally banded, with the color of the uppermost band indicating the main or preferred channel. The dayboard shape will be either square or triangular as determined by the color of the top band, as with a can or nun buoy used for this purpose.

Safe-water daybeacons marking fairways or the midchannel have an octagonal dayboard, painted red and white, divided in half vertically down the middle.

A diamond-shaped dayboard has no significance in the lateral system. A typical application might be to increase the daytime detectability of a minor light that is not a part of a channel or waterway series. These are often used to mark a shoal, rock, submerged object, or other hazard; they are also used to mark prohibited areas where boats must not enter.

Minor lights, and the lights on buoys, are equipped with electronic daylight controls that automatically turn the light on during periods of darkness and off during daylight. These controls are not of equal sensitivity; therefore all lights do not go on and off at the same time. Take care to identify aids correctly during twilight periods, when some may be on and others are not.

#### Wreck Buoys

Buoys that mark dangerous wrecks are generally lighted, and placed on the seaward or channel side of the obstruction and as near to it as possible. Wreck buoys are solid red or green if they can be safely passed on only one side; horizontally banded otherwise, and numbered as previously discussed. Be careful around wreck buoys, because sea action may have shifted the wreck since the last Coast Guard visit. Wreck buoys are also used in some instances where a fixed aid to navigation has been knocked down, but the remains have not been removed.

#### Isolated Danger Marks

In addition to the widespread lateral system of buoyage, the U.S. Coast Guard maintains a few aids to navigation in the cardinal system of buoyage. Such an aid is erected on, or moored above or near, an “isolated danger” that has unobstructed water on all sides. These marks should not be approached closely without special caution. Colors are red and black, horizontally banded; if lighted, the light is always white and group flashing (2), 6 seconds. A topmark of two black spheres vertically arranged is used on lighted and unlighted buoys; no numbers are used, but they may be lettered.

#### Seasonal Buoys

In some areas subject to severe icing during winters, the normal buoys are removed to prevent damage or loss. These are temporarily replaced with ice buoys, lighted or unlighted buoys of special sturdy construction. The placement and removal of such buoys are announced in Local Notices to Mariners and Light List changes. In some instances, lights on shore may be activated to guide vessels in the absence of buoys.

#### Racons

Some major aids to navigation are equipped with radar beacons, commonly shortened to racons. When a racon is triggered by pulses from a vessel’s radar, it transmits a reply that results in a better-defined display on that vessel’s radarscope, thus increasing accuracy of range and bearing measurements.

The reply may be coded to facilitate identification, in which case it will consist of a series of dots and dashes (short and/or long intensifications of the radar blips beginning at and extending beyond the racon’s position on the radar screen). The range is the measurement on the radarscope to the dash nearest its center. If the racon is not coded, the beacon’s signal will appear as a radial line extending from just beyond the reflected echo of the aid, or from just beyond where the echo would be seen if detected. Details of racon coding will be found in the Light Lists. The coded response of a racon may not be received if the radar set is adjusted to remove interference (IF) or sea clutter from the scope; interference controls should be turned off when reception of a racon signal is desired.

### Special-Purpose Aids

The Coast Guard also maintains several types of special-purpose aids with no lateral significance to mark anchorages, fish net areas, dredging limits, etc.

In the IALA-B system of buoyage, these are all yellow, regardless of the use to which they are put. These may be of can or nun shape, and, if lighted, the light will be yellow with any rhythm, fixed or slow flashing preferred. (Some are equipped with xenon discharge tube lights that flash very brightly but very briefly.) Dayboards on a daybeacon or minor light will be diamond shaped and yellow in color.

### Reporting Discrepancies

All boaters should realize that the U.S. Coast Guard cannot keep the many thousands of aids to navigation under constant observation, and it is impossible to keep every light, buoy, daybeacon, and fog signal operating properly and on its charted position at all times. The safety of all who use the waters will be enhanced if every person who discovers an aid missing, off station, or operating improperly notifies the nearest Coast Guard unit of the situation that has been observed. Use radio, land telephone, e-mail, or postal mail as dictated by the urgency of the report. You can also use the Coast Guard’s Boating Safety Mobile App, available for free download at www.uscgboating.org.

### Variations in the Basic U.S. System

Although all U.S. waters are marked by the basic U.S. Aids to Navigation System, there are some areas in which additional or modified markings are used to meet local needs.

#### Buoyage on the Western Rivers

Buoyage on the “Western Rivers”—the Mississippi River and its tributaries above Baton Rouge, LA, and on some other rivers that flow toward the Gulf of Mexico (see this page)—differs from the basic U.S. system in several ways:

• Aids to navigation are not numbered.

• Any numbers on aids to navigation are of no lateral significance, but show mileage (statute) from a fixed point—usually the river mouth.

• Diamond-shaped crossing dayboards, red-and-white or green-and-white as appropriate, are used to indicate where the river channel crosses from one bank to the other.

• Lights on green aids to navigation show a single-flash characteristic, which may be green or white.

• Lights on red aids to navigation show a group (2) flashing characteristic, which may be red or white.

• Isolated-danger and safe-water marks are not used.

In an effort to eliminate white lights from the lateral buoyage system, the U.S. Coast Guard is attempting to restrict their use to crossing daymarks.

#### Intracoastal Waterway Aids to Navigation

The Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) runs parallel to the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from Norfolk, Virginia, to the Mexican border. The purpose of the ICW is to provide a protected route for vessels making coastwise passages. Distances along the ICW are measured in statute miles, as the waterway is maintained by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Distinctive ICW markings Aids to navigation on the ICW are conventional buoys, daybeacons, and minor lights, but with added identification of yellow triangles on “red” aids and yellow squares on “green” aids; see Figure 14-16.

Figure 14-16 The dayboards on daybeacons and minor lights on the Intracoastal Waterways carry the usual numbers but also a yellow triangle or square. Buoys also have such a mark.

The conventional direction of buoyage in the ICW is generally southerly along the Atlantic coast, and first northerly then westerly along the Gulf of Mexico coast. Intracoastal Waterway aids are numbered in groups, with the numbers rarely exceeding “99” and beginning again with “1” or “2” at specified natural dividing points.

Buoy lights follow the standard system of red lights on red buoys and green lights on green buoys. Colors of minor lights fit the same pattern. Range lights, not being a part of the lateral system, may be of any standard color.

Dual-purpose aids The ICW was stitched together out of local rivers, channels, and fairways (with some additional land cuts created), which are marked in the conventional manner of the basic U.S. system. Some aids to navigation on these local waterways may also serve the Intracoastal Waterway. If they have this dual purpose, some portion of them is identified with either a yellow square (indicating a can buoy) or a yellow triangle (indicating a nun buoy). In some cases, a green can buoy marking a local channel may carry a yellow triangle for the ICW.

No matter what its basic shape, any aid of any shape carrying a yellow triangle should be left to starboard when following the ICW from north to south and on the Gulf Coast. Similarly, any aid with a yellow square should be left to port. Where dual markings are employed, the ICW skipper disregards the basic shape and coloring of the aid on which the yellow square or triangle is placed and pilots his craft solely by the shape of the yellow markings. The numbers on the aids will be those of the local channel’s lateral system, and in some instances where the southward ICW proceeds down a river, the numbers will be temporarily decreasing rather than increasing; see this page.

Nonlateral aids in the ICW—such as safe-water marks, isolated-danger marks, and ranges—will have a horizontal band or bar in yellow.

#### Canadian Aids to Navigation

In Canadian waters, the lateral system of buoyage is essentially the same as in the United States, but there may be minor differences in the physical appearance of some buoys. Cardinal aids of the IALA-B system are used in some areas. Boaters should learn the appearances and meanings of such aids. Chart symbols may be slightly different from those used on U.S. charts. Responsibility for aids to navigation in Canada resides with the Canadian Coast Guard under Transport Canada. The Canadian Coast Guard has embarked on a new project, Aids To Navigation of the Twenty-First Century (AToN 21). Information about the program can be found at http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca.

##### INLAND WATERS OBSTRUCTION MARK

To meet the needs of boaters on inland waters after the elimination of the United States Waterway Marking System, one new aid to navigation was created. On inland navigable waters designated by the Commandant of the Coast Guard as “state waters,” and on waters of a state where there is no defined head of navigation, such as lakes, the inland waters obstruction mark is used to indicate that an obstruction extends from the nearest shore out to that location. This buoy will have black-and-white vertical stripes, and its meaning is “Do not pass between this buoy and the shore.” If lighted, it will have a quick-flashing white characteristic.

#### Bahamas Aids to Navigation

The buoyage system in the Bahamas is essentially identical to the lateral system used in U.S. waters. Responsibility for the system resides with the Royal Bahamas Defence Force. The RBDF solicits reports on the condition and operation of ATONS including dayboards, buoys, lighthouses, beacons, and towers, and operates lighthouses with nominal ranges between 5.5 and 22.6 miles. Captains should take care to rely on their own navigational skills when operating in the Bahamas.

### Information & Regulatory Markers

Although not derived from the IALA-B system, the U.S. Aids to Navigation System also includes Information & Regulatory Marks, often called “markers.” These are used to alert skippers to various warning or regulatory matters. The markers may be either buoys or beacons.

These marks have orange geometric shapes against a white background. The meanings associated with the orange shapes are as follows:

• An open-faced diamond signifies danger.

• A vertical diamond shape with a cross centered within it indicates that vessels are excluded from the marked area.

• A circular shape indicates that certain operating restrictions are in effect within the marked area.

• A square or rectangular shape contains directions or instructions lettered within the shape.

When a buoy is used as an information or regulatory mark, it must be white in color with two horizontal orange bands placed completely around the buoy circumference. One band must be near the top of the buoy body, with the other just above the waterline; both bands must be clearly visible.

## PRIMARY SEACOAST & SECONDARY LIGHTS

Primary seacoast and secondary lights in the U.S. are so designated because of their greater importance as aids to navigation. They differ from the minor lights previously considered in their greater physical size, intensity of light, and complexity of light characteristics. These lights are more diverse than minor lights and buoys; only broad, general statements can be made about them as a group.

Primary seacoast lights warn the high-seas navigator of the proximity of land. They are the first aids seen when making a landfall (except where there may be a light tower or exposed location buoy). A coastwise navigator can use these lights to keep farther offshore at night than by using other visual aids. These are the most powerful and distinctive lights in the U.S. system of aids to navigation.

Primary seacoast lights may be located on the mainland or offshore on islands and shoals. Offshore, they may mark a specific hazard or they may serve merely as a marker for ships approaching a major harbor.

Many primary seacoast lights are classified according to the importance of their location, the intensity of light, and the prominence of the structure. Other aids are classed as secondary lights because of their lesser qualities in one or more of these characteristics. The dividing line is not clear, however, and lights that seem to be more properly in one category may be classified in the other group in the Light Lists (see this page). The difference in classification is of no real significance to boaters and can be ignored in practical piloting situations.

### Structures

The physical structure of a primary seacoast light and of many secondary lights is generally termed a lighthouse, although this is not a designation used in the Light Lists. The structure’s principal purpose is to support a light source and lens at a considerable height above water. The same structure may also house a sound signal or other equipment, and quarters for the personnel who operated the light station and equipment before all functions were automated and responsibility for the structures was turned over to local communities.

Lighthouses vary greatly in outward appearance depending on where they are, whether they are in the water or on shore, the light importance, the ground they stand on, and the prevalence of violent storms; see Figures 14-17, 14-18, and 14-19.

Figure 14-17 New London Ledge Light, Connecticut.

Figure 14-18 Split Rock Lighthouse State Park, Lake Superior, Minnesota.

Figure 14-19 Kilauea Point Lighthouse, Kauai, Hawaii.

Lighthouse structures also vary with the range of visibility they need; a lengthy range requires a tall tower or a high point of land, with a light of high candlepower—the standard measure of brightness. At points intermediate to principal lights, however, and where ship traffic is light, long range is not so necessary, and a simpler structure can be used.

#### Coloring of Structures

Many lighthouses and other light structures are marked with colors, bands, stripes, and other patterns to make them stand out against their backgrounds and to assist in their identification; see Figure 14-20.

Figure 14-20 Bands or stripes of various colors are often used to help in distinguishing lighthouses from their background, and as an aid to identification.

### Light Characteristics

Primary seacoast and secondary lights have distinctive light characteristics—lights of different colors, and lights that show continuously while others show in patterns. Their three standard colors are white, red, and green.

Table 14-2 The light phase characteristics of primary and secondary lights permit rapid identification at night. One full cycle of changes is the light’s period. Light phase characteristics can be combined—fixed and flashing, for example. Eclipses refer to periods of darkness.

#### Light Rhythms

Varying the intervals of lights and darkness in both simple and complex ways yields many different rhythms for major lights.

Fixed A light is termed “fixed” if it is always on, with no periods of darkness.

Flashing The term “flashing” has already been defined as a light that is on less than it is off in a regular sequence of single flashes occurring less than 30 times each minute. Some primary seacoast and secondary lights will “flash” in accordance with this definition, although their characteristics will have no relation to the flashes of buoys and minor lights. In general, a flashing major light will have a longer period (time of one complete cycle of the characteristic) and may have longer flashes—for example, Yaquina Head (Oregon) Light has a 20-second period with two flashes, each of 2 seconds duration.

In most instances, however, the light source is constant, and the “flashes” are produced by a rotating set of optical lenses; at close ranges, a weak steady light may be seen. Although a few major lights have a “fixed” characteristic (a continuous light without change of intensity or color), the light phase characteristics of primary seacoast or secondary lights are generally more complex, as described below (with current abbreviations); see this page.

Group Flashing (Fl [n]) The cycle of the light characteristic consists of two or more flashes separated by brief intervals and followed by a longer interval of darkness. (The “n” in the abbreviation will be replaced by the number of flashes for the light in question.)

Alternating Flashing (Al Fl) Flashes of alternating color, usually white and red or white and green.

Occulting (Oc) The light is on more than it is off; the interval of time that the light is lighted is greater than the time that it is eclipsed—its period of darkeness.

Isophase (Iso) Intervals of light and darkness are equal; the light is described in the Light List or on charts in terms of the period, the lighted and eclipsed portions each being just half of that time. This was formerly known as an “equal interval light.”

Group Occulting (Oc [n]) Intervals of light regularly broken by a series of two or more eclipses. This characteristic may have all eclipses of equal length, or one greater than the others. (The “n” in the abbreviation will be replaced by the number of eclipses for the light in question.)

#### Complex Characteristics

The above light phase characteristics may be combined. Examples include Gay Head Light “Alternating White/Red 15 seconds (Al W R 15s)” where there is a white flash for 0.2 seconds, an eclipse (period of darkness) for 7.3 seconds, a red flash for 0.2 seconds, and an eclipse of 7.3 seconds, for a total period of 15 seconds; or Minots Ledge Light “Group Flashing White 45 seconds (Fl W (1+4+3) 45s)” where 1.5-second white flashes occur with 1.5-second eclipses in groups of one, four, and three separated by 5-second intervals and followed by a 15.5-second longer interval to indicate the proper starting point of the 45-second period; or other characteristics of a generally similar nature.

#### Sectors

Many lights will have sectors—portions of their all-around arc of visibility in which the normally white light is seen as red or green. These sectors mark shoals or other hazards or warn of land nearby.

Lights so equipped show one color from most directions, but a different color or colors over prescribed arcs of the horizon as indicated on charts and in the Light List. A sector changes the color of a light when viewed from certain directions, but not the flashing or occulting characteristic. For example, a flashing white light with a red sector, when viewed from within the sector, will appear as flashing red; see Figure 14-21, left.

Figure 14-21 A hazardous area is often covered by a red sector of a light, and this sector (or sectors) is indicated by words along the arc on a chart (left). Aside from being red, the sector shows the same characteristics as the normal white sector of the light. A light may also be obscured over a sector, and this, too, is indicated on the chart. Note: The colors used here are for clarity and do not actually appear on a nautical chart.

Sectors may be a few degrees in width, as when marking a shoal or rock, or wide enough to extend from the direction of deep water to the shore. Bearings referring to sectors are expressed in degrees as they are observed from a vessel toward the light.

You should almost always avoid water areas covered by red sectors, but you should also check your chart to learn the extent of the hazard. Some lights are basically red (for danger) with one or more white sectors indicating the direction of safe passage, but a narrow white sector of another light may simply mark a turning point in a channel.

Lights may also have sectors in which the light is obscured—cannot be seen. These will be shown graphically on charts—see Figure 14-21, right—and are described in the Light Lists.

### The Visibility of Lights

A light’s theoretical visibility in clear weather depends on two factors: its intensity and its height above water. Its intensity fixes its nominal range, which is defined in the Light Lists as “the maximum distance at which the light may be seen in clear weather (meteorological visibility of 10 nautical miles).”

Height is important because of the earth’s curvature; height determines the geographic range at which the light can be seen. It is not affected by the intensity (provided that the light is bright enough to be seen out to the full distance of the geographic range).

The nominal range of major lights is generally greater than the geographic, and the distance from which such aids can be seen is limited only by the earth’s curvature. Such lights are often termed “strong”; a light limited by its luminous range is a “weak light.”

The glare, or loom, of strong lights is often seen far beyond the normal geographic range, and under rare atmospheric conditions the light itself may be visible at unusual distances. The range of visibility is obviously lessened by rain, fog, snow, haze, or smoke.

U.S. Coast Guard Light Lists show the nominal range for all lighted aids except private aids, navigation ranges, and directional lights (see this page), and show how to convert nominal range to luminous range—the maximum distance at which a light may be seen in specific existing visibilities. Both nominal and luminous ranges take no account of elevation, observer’s height of eye, or the curvature of the earth. (Any height of eye on board the vessel increases the effective geographic range for that specific situation.) For lights of complex characteristics, nominal ranges are given for each color and/or intensity.

The geographic range of lights is not given in the Light Lists but can be determined from the given height of the light source. The distance to the horizon may be taken from a table in the front pages of each Light List volume, or calculated using the equation D = 1.17  (where H is the height in feet and the distance is in nautical miles) or D = 2.12  here H is in meters and distance is still in nautical miles). For distances in statute miles, the factors are 1.35 and 2.44.

For any situation, the light’s range, as limited by the earth’s curvature, will be the distance to the horizon for the light plus the distance to the horizon for your height of eye—determine each distance separately, then add; do not add heights and make a single calculation. Boaters should know their height of eye when at the controls of their boat (and the height of any other position on board to which they can climb to see farther).

Lights on inland waters, where their radius of usefulness is not great, are frequently “weak” lights whose intensity need not reach the full limit of their geographic range.

##### CAUTIONS IN USING LIGHTS

Complex lights with several luminous ranges may appear different at extreme distances where, for example, a white fixed (or flashing) light can be seen but a red flash of the same light is not yet within luminous range. Examination of a Light List will show that the nominal range of a red or green light is usually 15 percent to 30 percent less than that of a white light from the same aid. Be cautious when identifying lights like these.

The effects of fog, rain, snow, and haze on the visibility of lights are obvious. Colored lights are more quickly lost to sight in poor weather than are white lights. On the other hand, refraction may also cause a light to be visible from a greater distance than normal.

Be cautious also when using light sectors in your navigation. The boundaries between the colors are not so distinct as the chart suggests; the lights shade gradually from one color into another.

Note, too, that the increasing use of brilliant shore lights for advertising, illuminating bridges, and other purposes may cause marine navigational lights, particularly those in densely populated areas, to be outshone and difficult to distinguish from background lighting.

A light can also be extinguished for some reason. Unattended lights that are broken may not be immediately detected and corrected. If you do not see a light reasonably soon after your course and speed suggest that you should, check the situation carefully. Do not rely on any one light, except perhaps for making a landfall. For positive identification, use several lights together as a system, checking each against the others.

### Identification of Lights

Charts can only briefly describe the character-istics of a primary seacoast or secondary light by means of abbreviations and a notation of the total period of the light cycle. You will often need to consult the Light Lists for details of the characteristics to help you identify it positively.

When you first see a light, note its color and time its full cycle of light changes. If color, period, and number of flashes per cycle match the Light List information, the light has been identified. As a precaution, however, check the charts and Light Lists to be sure that no other light in the vicinity has similar characteristics.

#### Emergency Lights

Emergency lights of reduced nominal range are displayed from many light stations when the main light is inoperative. These standby lights may or may not have the same characteristics as the main light. The existence of the standby light (if any) and its characteristics (if different) are noted in the Light Lists.

## SOUND SIGNALS

Any sound-producing instrument operated in time of fog or other condition of reduced visibility from a definite point shown on a chart serves as a useful sound signal. To use it effectively as an aid to navigation, you must be able to identify it and know its location.

As mentioned, the simpler sound signals used on buoys are operated by sea action, and thus you may have difficulty identifying them. Sound signals at all lighthouses and other lights are electrically or mechanically operated on definite time schedules, however, so are easier to identify positively.

##### CAUTIONS IN USING SOUND SIGNALS

Sound signals obviously depend upon the transmission of sound through the air. As aids to navigation, they thus have inherent limitations that you must consider. Because sound travels through air in a variable and unpredictable manner, you should note that:

• The distance at which a sound signal can be heard may vary at any given instant with the bearing of the signal, and may be different on different occasions.

• Under certain atmospheric conditions you may hear only part of a sound signal that is a siren or that has a combination of high and low tones.

• There are sometimes areas close to a signal where you will not hear it, perhaps when the signal is screened by intervening landmasses or other obstructions, or when it is on a high cliff.

• The apparent loudness of a sound signal may be greater at a distance than in its immediate vicinity.

• A patch of fog or smoke may exist at a short distance from a manned station but not be seen from it. Thus the signal may not be placed in operation.

• Some sound signals require a start-up interval.

• You may not hear a sound signal with your boat’s engine on, but you may hear it suddenly when it is off or if you go forward on board away from its noise.

In summary, sound signals are valuable as warnings, but do not place implicit reliance upon them in navigating your vessel.

Based on the above established facts, you must not assume:

• That you are out of the ordinary hearing distance of a sound signal because you do not hear it.

• That because you hear a sound signal faintly, you are at a distance from it.

• That you are near to the sound signal because you hear it clearly.

• That the sound signal is not sounding because you do not hear it, even when you know that you are nearby.

• That the detection distance and sound intensity under any one set of conditions is an infallible guide for any future occasion.

### Signal Characteristics

Sound signal characteristics consist of the length of a total cycle of one or more blasts of specific length and one or more silent intervals, also of definite lengths. These times are shown in the Light Lists to aid in identification. (Normally, only the type of sound signal, without further details, is indicated on charts.) When you are counting the blasts and timing the cycle, refer to the Light Lists for its details.

#### Sound Signal Equipment

Sound signals also differ from each other in tone, which helps in identification. The signal type for each station is shown in the Light Lists and on charts.

Diaphones produce sound by means of a slotted reciprocating piston activated by compressed air. Blasts may consist of two tones of different pitch, in which case the first part of the blast is of higher pitch and the latter is lower. These alternate-pitch signals are termed “two-tone.”

Diaphragm horns produce sound by means of a disc diaphragm vibrated by compressed air or electricity. Duplex and triplex horn units of different pitch are sometimes combined to produce a more musical signal.

Sirens produce sound by means of either a disc or cup-shaped rotor actuated by compressed air, steam, or electricity. These should not be confused with “police sirens”; these aids may produce a sound of constant pitch much like a diaphragm horn or a whistle.

Whistles produce sound by compressed air emitted through a slot into a cylindrical bell chamber.

#### Operation of Signals

Sound signals at stations where a continuous watch is maintained are placed in operation whenever the visibility decreases below a limit set for that location; typically, this might be five miles.

Sound signals at locations without a continuous watch may not always be sounded promptly when conditions of reduced visibility occur, or may operate erratically due to mechanical difficulties.

Where sound signals are operated continuously on a seasonal basis or throughout the year, this information will be found in the Light Lists.

On buoys where sound signals are operated by sea motion, the signals may be heard in any condition of visibility.

## RANGES & DIRECTIONAL LIGHTS

Ranges and directional lights serve to indicate the centerline of a channel and thus aid in the safe piloting of a vessel. Although they are used in connection with channels and other restricted waterways, and shown on all the appropriate charts, they are not a part of the lateral system of buoyage.

### Ranges

A range consists of two fixed aids to navigation so positioned with respect to each other that when seen in line they indicate that the observer’s craft may be in safe waters; see Figure 14-22. The aids may be lighted or unlighted as determined by the importance of the range.

Figure 14-22 Lighted ranges are often used to mark channels in rivers, particularly where cross-currents exist. This range is on the St. Clair River on a true bearing of 207¼°. Range front light structures sometimes have all-round “passing lights” lower than the range light. The crossed-dashed line is the international border between Michigan and Ontario.

The conditional phrase “may be in safe waters” is used because observation of the two markers in line is not an absolute determination of safety. A range is “safe” only within specific limits of distance from the front marker. A vessel too close or too far away may be in a dangerous area. The aids that comprise the range do not in themselves indicate the usable portion of the range; check your chart and other aids.

Ranges are described in the Light Lists by first giving the position of the front marker, usually in terms of geographic coordinates—latitude and longitude—and then stating the location of the rear marker in terms of direction and distance from the front marker. This direction, given in degrees and minutes, true, need not be used in ordinary navigation, but is useful in making checks of compass deviation. The rear dayboard (and light, if used) is always higher than the one on the front aid; see Figure 14-23.

Figure 14-23 A skipper can keep within a narrow channel by following a range. At A, the front and range marks are in line, with the higher rear mark directly over the lower front mark. If he gets “off range,” the markers will not be aligned, as shown in B. The channel may turn before reaching the range front marker, as in C; the turning point is normally marked by a buoy.

Because of their fixed nature, and the accuracy with which a vessel can be positioned by using them, ranges are among the best aids to navigation. Use a range whenever one is available, and use a buoy only to determine the beginning and end of the usable portion of the range.

Ranges are used outbound just as they are inbound, by sighting over the stern. Make sure you do not meet head-on a vessel using the range in the opposite direction to your own.

#### Unlighted Ranges

Although any two objects may be used as a range, the term is properly applied only to those pairs of structures built specifically for that purpose. Special shapes and markings are used for the front and rear aids of a range for easier identification and more accurate alignment. Differing designs have been used in the past, but the Coast Guard has now standardized the use of rectangular day-boards, longer dimension vertical, painted in vertical stripes of contrasting colors; see this page. The design of specific range dayboards will normally be found in the Light Lists.

#### Lighted Ranges

Because of their importance and high accuracy in piloting, most range markers are equipped with lights to extend their usefulness through the hours of darkness; they may or may not have the usual dayboards. Entrance channels are frequently marked with range lights; the Delaware River on the Atlantic Coast and the Columbia River on the Pacific Coast are examples of this.

Range lights may be of any color used with aids to navigation—white, red, or green—and may show any of several characteristics. The principal requirement is that they be easily distinguished from shore backgrounds and from other lights. Front and rear lights will, however, normally be of the same color (white is frequently used because of its greater visibility range), with different rhythms. Since both lights must be observed together for the proper steering of the craft, range lights often have a greater “on” interval than other lights do. Range rear lights are normally on more than their front counterparts; many ranges now show an isophase (equal interval) rear light and a quick-flashing front light.

Many range lights are fitted with special lenses that give a much greater intensity on the range centerline than off it; the lights rapidly decrease in brilliance when observed from only a few degrees to either side. In some cases, the light will be visible only from on or very near the range line; in other cases, a separate, lower light of lesser intensity may be seen all around the horizon—this can be either from the main light source or from a small auxiliary “passing” light. Light is shown around the horizon when the front aid also serves to mark the side of a channel at a turn of direction.

Historically, most ranges have had dayboards for daytime operations and lights for night use. With advances in technology, more and more ranges are being converted to lights for both day and night use. If the active portion of the range is of moderate or short length, and the near end is not too far from the front light, a single light may be used on each structure, burning 24 hours a day. If the usable portion of the range is considerable and/or its near end is some distance from the front structure, there will be two lights on each structure, as a light strong enough to reach out the required distance by day may be too bright for nighttime use. These pairs of lights may have different colors, but both lights, front and rear, of each pair will have the same color. The light rhythms of the two pairs may be different—the daytime lights are often fixed white; the nighttime lights are colored red or green with typical flashing patterns as described above. The arcs of visibility may be different for the day and night ranges. Each range is evaluated on its specific situation, and lights are installed as appropriate. Typically, these day/night ranges do not have dayboards; this permits lower and less expensive structures because of lesser wind loading, and simplifies maintenance that is costly and hazardous to servicing personnel.

### Directional Lights

The establishment of a range requires suitable locations for two aids, separated adequately both horizontally and vertically. In some areas, this may not be possible, and a single light of special characteristics will be employed.

A directional light is a single light source fitted with a special lens so as to show a white light in a narrow beam along a desired direction, with red and green showing to either side. Width of the sectors will depend upon the local situation, but red will be seen if the pilot is to the right of the centerline as he approaches the aid from seaward, and green if he is to the left of the desired track.

A typical example is the Thames River Upper Directional Light (Connecticut) that shows an isophase 6-second white light over an arc of 3 degrees, with green and red sectors 3 degrees wide on either side; it cannot be seen from any other direction. A quite different light is the Kailua Bay Entrance Directional Light (Hawaii), which shows an occulting 4-second white light, 3 degrees either side of the correct heading of 023 degrees True, with a green sector 34 degrees wide and a red sector 70 degrees in width.

An interesting use of a directional light is seen at Port Everglades, Florida. The front range light is sometimes obscured by a tanker discharging its cargo. A special type of directional light, known as a Pell Sector Light, is used for the range rear light. It functions as a range rear light if the front light can be seen; if that light is blocked, the rear light alone is used as a directional light, with very complex characteristics, to mark the entrance channel.

Directional lights will normally have an occulting or isophase characteristic, so that they are easily followed.

#### Caution Regarding Directional Lights

A skipper should not place too great a reliance on the various colors of a directional light for safe positional information. As noted for light sectors, the boundaries between colors are not sharp and clear; the light shades imperceptibly from one color to the other along the stated, and charted, dividing lines.

# CHAPTER15

NAUTICAL CHARTS & PUBLICATIONS

The Importance of Charts • Charts vs. Maps • Chart Features • Symbols & Abbreviations • Chart Projections • Navigational Publications

To travel anywhere safely in his or her boat, a skipper must have knowledge of water depths, shoals, and channels. The location of aids to navigation and landmarks must be known, and where ports and harbors can be found. At any given position, depth can usually be measured and some landmarks seen; but for true safety a boater has to know the depth ahead, the actual location of the aids to navigation seen, and where more aids lie on the course that will be followed. To plan the best route to the destination, he or she must know the dangers to navigation along the way. This information can best be determined from up-to-date nautical charts. The skipper must not only have the required charts on board, he or she must also know how to use them.

In addition to the traditional paper charts, electronic charts are now available to many boaters; see this page. These wonders of digital electronics come in various packages and can be used with dedicated chartplotters, multifunction chart/radar/sonar displays, general-purpose computers, and handheld GPS units. They offer many advantages, but they should augment—not replace—paper charts.

## CHARTS VS. MAPS

A map is a representation in miniature on a plane surface of a portion of the earth’s surface. Intended for use on land, it emphasizes roads, cities, and political boundaries—see Figure 15-01—or, in the case of a topographic map, natural landscape features.

Figure 15-01 A map is designed to emphasize information about land features such as roads—as shown here on this map of the lower Chesapeake Bay. Underwater and coastal features are almost ignored.

A nautical chart is a similar representation in miniature—to scale—emphasizing the water areas and natural and man-made features of particular interest to a navigator; see Figure 15-02. A chart includes information about depth of water, obstructions and other hazards to navigation, and the location and type of aids to navigation. Adjacent land areas are portrayed only with details that aid a navigator—the shoreline, harbor facilities, and prominent natural or man-made features. Charts are printed on heavyweight, durable paper so that they may be used as worksheets on which courses may be plotted and positions determined. For skippers of small craft, there are special charts with details on marinas and similar facilities.

Figure 15-02 A chart of the lower Chesapeake Bay is far more detailed than a map of the same area. It is almost exclusively concerned with navigation on the water. Note the amount of data that is conveyed by each square inch of the chart—all achieved without compromising its clarity.

A chart’s basic purpose is to give the navigator information that enables him to make the right decision in time to avoid danger. Charts differ from road maps both in kinds of information and in the precision of their details: for safety, charts must be extremely accurate. Even a small error in charting the position of a submerged obstruction can be a serious hazard to navigation.

Various “cruising guides” are available for many boating areas. These are useful in planning a nautical trip with chart reproductions or extracts, textual information, useful data, and even aerial photographs. What these lack, however, are provisions for revisions between printings comparable to Notices to Mariners changes for official charts; see this page. Use the information in cruising guides, but do not try to substitute them for genuine nautical charts.

### Geographic Coordinates

Charts show a grid of intersecting lines to aid in describing a specific position on the water. These lines are charted representations of a system of geographic coordinates that are imagined to exist on the earth’s surface.

The earth is nearly spherical in shape—it is slightly flattened along the polar axis, but the distortion is minimal and need concern only those who construct the charts, not boaters. A great circle is the line traced out on the surface of a sphere by a plane cutting through the sphere at its center; see Figure 15-03, upper. It is the largest circle that can be drawn on the surface of a sphere. A small circle is one marked on the surface of a sphere by a plane that does not pass through its center; see Figure 15-03, lower.

Figure 15-03 A great circle, above, is the line traced on the surface of sphere by a plane that cuts through the center of the sphere. A small circle, below, is a line traced on the surface of a sphere that does not cut through the sphere’s center.

#### Meridians & Parallels

Geographic coordinates are defined by two sets of great and small circles. One is a set of great circles each of which passes through the north and south geographic poles—these are the meridians of longitude; see Figure 15-04, left. The other set is a series of circles each established by a plane cutting through the earth perpendicular to the polar axis. The largest of these is midway between the poles and thus passes through the center of the earth, becoming a great circle; this is the equator. Other parallel planes form the small circles known as parallels of latitude; see Figure 15-04, right.

Figure 15-04 Meridians of longitude on the earth are great circles, left, that pass through both the north and south poles. Parallels of latitude, right, are small circles that are parallel to the plane of the equator. The equator is a great circle that is perpendicular to the earth’s axis.

Geographic coordinates are measured in terms of degrees (one degree is 1/360th of a complete circle). The meridian that passes through Greenwich, England, is the reference for all measurements of longitude and is designated as the prime meridian, or 0°. The longitude of any position on earth is described as so many degrees East or West of Greenwich, to a maximum in either direction of 180°. The measurement can be thought of as either the angle at the North and South Poles between the meridian of the place being described and the prime meridian, or as the arc along the equator between these meridians; see Figure 15-05, left. The designation of “E” or “W” is an essential part of any statement of longitude, abbreviated as “Long,” or “Lo” or as “λ” (the Greek letter lambda).

Figure 15-05 Longitude, left, is measured from the prime meridian (0°), which passes through Greenwich, England, east or west to a maximum of 180°. Latitude, right, is measured north or south from the equator (0°) to the poles (90°). Meridians of longitude and parallels of latitude are shown at 15° intervals.

Parallels of latitude are measured in degrees north or south from the equator, from 0° at the equator to 90° at each pole. The designation of latitude (abbreviated as “Lat.” or “L”) must include “N” or “S” as necessary to provide a complete position; see Figure 15-05, right.

For greater precision in position definition, degrees are subdivided into minutes (60 minutes = 1 degree) and seconds (60 seconds = 1 minute). In some instances, minutes are divided decimally, and for very high precision, seconds can be so divided.

From Figure 15-05, left, you can see that the meridians of longitude get closer together as one moves away from the equator in either direction, and converge at the poles. Thus the distance on the earth’s surface between adjacent meridians is not a fixed quantity but varies with latitude. On the other hand, except for extremely small technicalities, the parallels of latitude are equally spaced and the distance between successive parallels is the same. One degree of latitude is, for all practical purposes, 60 nautical miles; 1 minute of latitude is used as 1 nautical mile, a relationship that we will later see is quite useful.

### Chart Construction

The construction of a chart presents the problem of representing a spherical, three-dimensional surface on a two-dimensional sheet of paper. It is impossible to accomplish this exactly, and a certain amount of distortion is inevitable, but various methods, called projections, can provide practical and sufficiently accurate results.

The transfer of information from the sphere to the chart’s flat surface should be accomplished with as little distortion as possible in both the shape and the size of land and water areas, the angular relation of positions, the distance between points, and other more technical properties. Each projection is superior to others in one or more of these qualities; none is superior in all characteristics. In all projections, as the area covered by the chart is decreased the distortion diminishes, and the difference between types of projections lessens.

Of the many projection techniques that are used, two are of primary interest to boaters. The Mercator projection is an example of the most common; it is used for charts of ocean and coastal areas. The polyconic projection is employed for National Ocean Service (NOS) charts of the Great Lakes and some inland rivers. The average skipper can quite safely navigate his boat using either type of chart without a deep knowledge of the techniques of projection. (For those who would like to know more about the various projection methods, see this page.)

### Direction

Direction is defined as the angle between a line connecting one point with another and a base, or reference, line such as the geographic or magnetic meridian passing through the original point; the angle is measured in degrees clockwise from the reference line. Thus direction on charts may be described as so many degrees true (T) or so many degrees magnetic (M). The difference between these directions is variation and must be allowed for, as described in Chapter 13. The principal difference in the use of charts on the Mercator projection from those on the polyconic projection lies in the techniques for measuring direction; this is covered later in this chapter; see this page.

#### Measurement of Direction

To facilitate the measurement of direction, as in plotting bearings and laying out courses, most charts have compass roses printed on them. A compass rose consists of two or three concentric circles, several inches in diameter and accurately subdivided; see Figure 15-06. The outer circle has its zero at true North; this is emphasized with a star. The next inner circle is magnetic direction expressed in degrees, with an arrow printed over the zero point to indicate magnetic North. The innermost circle, if there are three, is also magnetic direction, but in terms of “points,” and halves and quarters thereof; its use by modern boaters will be limited. (One point = 11¼ degrees.) The use of points with the mariner’s compass is covered in Chapter 13.

Figure 15-06 A compass rose illustrates true and magnetic directions. The outer circle is in degrees, with zero at true north. The inner circle or circles are in degrees and “points” with their zero at magnetic north. Several compass roses are located on each chart at locations convenient for plotting courses and bearings. Some charts of the Small Craft series omit the innermost circle with its point system of subdivision.

The difference between the orientation of the outer and inner circles is the magnetic variation at the location of the compass rose. The amount of the variation and its direction (easterly or westerly) is given in words and figures in the center of the rose, together with a statement of the year that such variation existed and the annual rate of change. When using a chart in a year much later than the compass rose date, it may be necessary to modify the variation shown by applying the annual rate of change. Such cases are relatively rare, however, as the rates of change are quite small and differences of a fraction of a degree may generally be ignored. Each chart has several compass roses printed on it in locations where they do not conflict with navigational information.

Until a skipper has thoroughly mastered the handling of compass “errors,” he should use only true directions and the true (outer) compass rose. Later, the magnetic rose may be used directly, thus simplifying computations.

Several cautions are necessary when measuring directions on charts. For large-area charts, the magnetic variation can differ for various portions of the chart. Check each chart when you first start to use it, and, to be sure, always use the compass rose nearest the area for which you are plotting. Depending upon a chart’s type and scale, graduations on its compass rose circles may be for intervals of 1°, 2°, or 5°. On some charts, the outer (true) circle is subdivided into units of 1° while the inner (magnetic) circle, being smaller, is subdivided into steps of 2°. Always check to determine the interval between adjacent marks on each compass rose scale.

##### UNIT CONVERSION

On salt water, distances are measured in nautical miles, while the statute mile is used on shore, in freshwater bodies, and along the Intracoastal Waterways. Depths are usually measured in feet on inshore and near-coastal waters; offshore, the unit of depth measurement is the fathom—which is 6 feet (1.83 m). Increasingly, metric units are coming into use for depths and short distances.

While it is easy to make conversions graphically by using the various unit scales presented, you may also need to make conversions by using the numeric conversion factors given below (factors are rounded, except where shown as “exactly”), or by using quick rules of thumb, as shown at bottom.

* nautical miles x 1.15 = statute miles

* statute miles x 0.87 = nautical miles

* nautical miles x 1,852 = meters (exactly)

* meters x 0.00054 = nautical miles

* nautical miles x 2,025.4 = yards

* yards x 0.00049 = nautical miles

* statute miles x 1,609 = meters

* meters x 0.00062 = statute miles

* statute miles x 1,760 = yards (exactly)

* yards x 0.9144 = meters

* meters x 1.094 = yards

* fathoms x 6 = feet (exactly)

* feet x 0.16667 = fathoms

* fathoms x 1.828 = meters

* meters x 0.5468 = fathoms

###### RULES OF THUMB

Roughly 7 nautical miles equals 8 statute miles, so you can convert nautical to statute by multiplying nautical miles by 8 and dividing the product by 7. To reverse the conversion: multiply statute miles by 7, then divide by 8. A nautical mile has about 2,000 yards—close enough for quick calculations.

### Distance

Distances on charts are measured in statute or in nautical miles. Use of the statute (land) mile of 5,280 feet (approximately 1,609 m) is limited to the Great Lakes, inland rivers, and the Atlantic and Gulf Intracoastal Waterways. The nautical mile of 6,076.1 feet (exactly 1,852 m) is used on ocean and coastal waters.

In navigation, distances up to a mile or so usually are expressed in yards, a unit that is the same no matter which “mile” is used on the chart. Foreign charts will commonly use meters for shorter distances, and this unit may come into wider use on U.S. charts.

Conversion factors and rules of thumb are shown opposite; more complete conversion tables will be found in Appendix D.

Conversions can also be made graphically using graphic bar scales; see Figure 15-07. A distance measured on one scale by using a pair of dividers can be measured on another scale to determine the equivalent distance using an alternate measurement system.

Figure 15-07 NOS charts of scales of 1:80,000 and larger will have a scale of nautical miles and one of yards; those for the Great Lakes, inland rivers, and the Intracoastal Waterways will also carry a scale of statute miles. This 1:40,000 small-craft chart additionally has latitude and longitude scales showing subdivisions of one minute.

### Chart Scales

The amount by which actual distances are reduced for representation on a chart is known as the scale of that chart; many different scales are used. Scale may be expressed as a ratio, 1:80,000 meaning that 1 unit on the chart represents 80,000 units on the actual land or water surface, or as a fraction 1/80,000 with the same meaning. This is termed the natural scale of the chart.

The ratio of chart to actual distance can also be expressed as a numerical or equivalent scale, such as “1 inch = 1.1 miles”—another way of expressing a 1:80,000 scale. Equivalent scales are not as commonly used on nautical charts as on maps, but they may be encountered in publications such as cruising guides.

Charts at a scale of 1:80,000 or larger (e.g. 1:40,000) will normally carry, in addition to a statement of scale, two sets of graphic bar scales, each subdivided into conveniently and commonly used units; refer to Figure 15-07. Note that one basic unit is placed to the left of the scale’s zero point and is subdivided more finely than is the main part of the scale. The use of these graphic scales is covered in Chapter 16.

When using Mercator charts, the navigator can take advantage of the fact that one minute on the latitude scale on each side of the chart is essentially equal to one nautical mile. (Do not use the longitude scale at the top or bottom of the chart.) On charts of a scale smaller than 1:80,000 (e.g. 1:1,200,000), the latitude scale will be the only means of measuring distance.

It is important to fix in your mind the scale of the chart you are using, lest you misjudge distances. Quite often in a day’s cruise you may use charts of different scales, changing back and forth between small-scale coastal charts and larger-scale harbor charts. Unless you are aware of the differing scales, you may find yourself in a dangerous position.

A logarithmic speed scale is printed on all charts of 1:40,000 or larger scale; see Figure 15-08. It is useful for graphically solving problems of time, speed, and distance; the technique is explained in Chapter 16.

Figure 15-08 NOS charts of 1:40,000 or larger scale carry a Logarithmic Speed Scale that can be used to graphically solve problems of time, distance, and speed. Its use is explained in Chapter 16.

### Chart Sources

Charts are prepared and issued by several agencies of the U.S. federal government. This is not duplication, however, because different agencies are responsible for different areas and types of charts. Most boaters use charts prepared by the Office of Coast Survey (OCS) within the National Ocean Service (NOS), which is in turn a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce. NOS charts (sometimes referred to as NOAA charts) cover the Great Lakes and the coastal waters of the United States, including harbors and rivers extending inland to the head of tidal action.

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) publishes charts of the high seas and foreign waters based on its own and other nations’ surveys. Some of these charts may still bear the name of predecessors, such as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA) and the Defense Mapping Agency Hydrographic/Topographic Center (DMAHTC). Boaters will use NGA charts, for example, when cruising the Bahamas.

Charts of major inland rivers such as the Mississippi and Ohio are issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Also available are charts of many inland lakes and canal systems.

Canadian waters are charted by the Canadian Hydrographic Service, an agency of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.

##### LARGE-SCALE & SMALL-SCALE

When chart scales are expressed fractionally, confusion sometimes results from the use of the terms “large-scale” and “small-scale.” Since the number that is varied to change the scale is in the denominator of the fraction, as it gets larger, the fraction, and hence the scale, gets smaller. For example, 1/80,000 is a smaller fraction than 1/40,000, so a chart to the former scale is termed a smaller-scale chart.

The terms “large-scale” and “small-scale” are relative and have no limiting definitions. Scales may be as large as 1:5,000 for detailed harbor charts, or as small as 1 to several million for charts of large areas of the world.

#### Chart Catalogs

Issuing agencies used to publish print catalogs listing the name, scale, coverage area, and price of each available chart. However, the Office of Coast Survey has replaced its seven chart catalogs with an online search tool, the Chart Locator, that can be accessed from https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov. The NGA chart catalog is discussed on this page.

#### Where to Obtain Charts

Charts may be purchased from retail sales agents, which are widely located in boating and shipping centers and are listed at https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/print-agents.html#paper-charts. Some chart agents offer print-on-demand charts, ensuring that you get the most up-to-date version; see this page.

The price of NOS and NGA charts has risen in recent years and continues to rise. The cost of a full set for many boating areas has become a major expense for a boater. These greater prices, however, still do not cover the full costs of surveys, data compilation, printing, and distribution. Government charts should be considered a bargain given the extent, accuracy, and importance of the information they provide.

Charts can be purchased in quantity at a discount from the single chart price. Electronic charts in raster (RNC) and vector (ENC) format can be downloaded from the NOAA website; see this page. The NGA’s Digital Nautical Charts of foreign waters can be downloaded at https://dnc.nga.mil or purchased in print-on-demand format at www.nauticalchartsonline.com/charts/NGA.

Reproductions of government charts are also available from commercial organizations in bound volumes for greater convenience and at somewhat lower cost.

You should keep a full set of charts aboard for the waters you cruise, and regularly replace worn-out or outdated charts with new ones. Failure to have a proper chart could be a factor in determining liability in the event of an accident.

## WHAT CHARTS SHOW

Charts include much information that you should study thoroughly before you use the chart for navigation. Clear the kitchen or dining room table and spread your charts out—do it before you cruise into unfamiliar waters. Study charts can also be displayed on a computer using chart-planning programs. This can provide a measure of “boating fun” when the weather is too cold or too wet and windy to get your craft underway. There is an amazing amount of information on every nautical chart; learn how to get every bit of it.

When hydrographic surveys have been completed, cartographers are presented with vast amounts of information—so much so that if they were to include it all, charts would be a useless mass of black and colored ink. The cartographer’s task is to edit the survey information, deciding what to include and what to leave out. Even so, such a large amount of data remains that every element on the printed chart must be made to carry meaning. To learn to read a chart, you must recognize that nothing has been placed there without significance.

### Basic Information

Located on the chart where space is available is the general information or title block; see Figure 15-09. Here is the chart title describing the waters covered (the chart number does not appear here, but rather in several places around the margins); a statement of the type of projection used and the scale; the unit of depth measurement (feet or fathoms—one fathom equals six feet—or meters), and the datum plane for such soundings. (Caution: if the chart has insets—“blow-ups” of areas of special interest—these will be at a larger scale than the chart as a whole.)

Figure 15-09 The title block of a chart shows the official name of the chart, the type of projection, and scale, plus the datum and unit of measurement for depths. Printed nearby is much valuable information, so be sure to read all notes before using any chart.

Elsewhere on the chart where space is available (normally in land areas), you will find other information, including the meaning of certain commonly used abbreviations, units and the datum for heights above water, notes of caution regarding dangers, tidal information, references to anchorage areas, and a statement of the applicable volume of the Coast Pilot (see this page). Read all notes on charts; they provide important information that cannot be graphically presented; see Figure 15-10.

Figure 15-10 Notes printed on charts may concern navigation regulations, hazardous conditions at inlets, information on controlling depths that cannot be printed conveniently alongside a channel, or other matters that relate to navigation.

##### PRINT-ON-DEMAND CHARTS

NOAA has a “print-on-demand” (POD) capability. This is the use of large-format inkjet printers to produce charts at decentralized locations. Files are maintained in NOS databases and updated weekly with data that is published in Notices to Mariners and Local Notices to Mariners (see this page), as well as information from NOS field activities and cooperating organizations not yet published. POD charts may be purchased from OCS retail sales agents; a list of agents is at https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/print-agents.html#paper-charts.

Print-on-demand offers the following benefits for users:

• POD charts are up-to-date when purchased, whereas printed charts may be months or even years out of date when sold. POD charts are typically available to boaters less than one week after passing internal NOAA review, well in advance of new printed editions. A user can go to https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/charts/list-of-latest-editions.html to find the dates of the latest editions.

• POD charts are even better than before, with brighter colors and higher contrast for improved readability in various light conditions. The paper used is water and abrasion resistant. Charts can be furnished in a double-sided laminated version for a small additional cost.

• Chart information comes from a variety of sources to ensure greater accuracy. Because new editions are saved as digital computer files, cartographers can apply corrections to the master file as soon as new information is received. Normally, the charts are updated on a weekly basis with information from the USCG Local Notices to Mariners, NGA Notices to Mariners, Canadian Notice to Mariners, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, NOAA hydrographic survey, U.S. Power Squadrons, and various state and local governments. The newly updated files are then made available to retail sales agents.

Print-on-demand provides the following benefits for sales agents and the government:

• Reduction of the need for space and costs of maintaining inventories.

• Elimination of the wasteful trashing of obsolete charts when a new edition is issued.

Print-on-demand charts are official and sufficient to meet all legal requirements where applicable. (Current editions of charts are not required on board recreational small craft, but their availability and use will be beneficial in case of accidents, lawsuits, etc.) POD charts carry the usual edition number and publication date, but also have an “Additional Corrections” box in the lower-left corner that notes the latest Notices to Mariners and Local Notices to Mariners for which the chart has been corrected.

There are, however, some disadvantages. Conventional POD charts are somewhat larger than the normally printed version. This added space is put to good use with additional information, but the larger size may make handling more difficult on smaller boats.

Print-on-demand is also available in three compact formats for use on smaller boats.

• MapFold Charts mimic the NOAA pocket-fold charts (see this page)—printed on both sides and folded like a road map.

• PocketCharts are complete NOAA charts reduced to about 34% of full scale, intended for use as a locator. This format is not suitable for a serious navigator. The chart is overlaid with enlarged text for certain populated places important to recreational boaters, landmarks, water body names, and the characteristics of key aids to navigation. The reverse side is a mix of safety, education, and boating information. The PocketChart is reassembled by NOAA from up-to-date files every time a NOAA publisher partner orders one.

• BookletCharts are complete NOAA charts, up-to-date for all Notices to Mariners, reduced to about 75% of full scale and tiled into 8.5x11 inch panels. They are available for some but not all Atlantic Coast, Gulf Coast, Pacific Coast, Alaska, and Great Lakes charts, and may be printed at home for free or purchased from a NOAA publisher partner, bound and waterproof. They are for use on noncommercial small craft.

All NOS charts except a few pocket-fold and book charts are available in the print-on-demand format—information on availability can be found at the website mentioned earlier. These charts can be purchased from many of the larger chart sales agents—again, see the website for the current list of retail dealers. Charts that are ordered at one of these dealers (in person or by phone, fax, or Internet) can be printed while you wait or will be available the next business day; if the latter, they can be picked up at the store or drop-shipped directly to the user. (Occasionally, a retail agent may have in stock some POD charts that are up-to-date for all corrections.)

The cost of a print-on-demand chart is a few dollars more than a conventionally printed chart. The POD system supplements but does not replace the long-standing chart distribution system, and charts as we have known them for many years remain available.

###### DO-IT-YOURSELF CHARTS

All the chart files in the NOS database are available to the public without charge via the Internet. An online “reader” is available on the NOAA website that allows the viewing of a chart, or portions of it, at various scales.

For off-line viewing and printing, the files can be downloaded to a personal computer. These are large files, and although they are downloaded in compressed format, a high-speed broadband connection is advisable. Each chart is unzipped into a folder that contains the updated chart plus the “patches” for Notice to Mariner changes that have already been applied. Several different free off-line readers can be downloaded to your computer from the NOAA website. PC monitors and typical home or office printers are too small to permit the viewing or printing of a full chart, but areas of particular interest can be shown at scales typical of a printed chart, or at larger or smaller scales. Additional information such as waypoints or other notes can be added to the downloaded chart file.

These do-it-yourself charts are not suitable for navigation but are very useful for planning.

###### POD CHARTS IN CANADA

The Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) also provides a print-on-demand chart service. There are some differences from the NOS operations, but the result is similar for users. The basic information can be found at www.charts.gc.ca/index-eng.asp. The CHS does not sell charts directly to the public, but distributes them to more than 800 dealers across Canada and around the world. They also offer charts in two digital formats – Electronic Navigational Charts (ENC), with powerful onscreen navigation, and raster charts, which are electronic versions of paper charts. Mariners using raster charts are required by Canadian law to also carry paper charts on board.

#### Editions & Revisions

The edition number and publication date of a chart is shown at the lower left-hand corner; immediately following these figures is the month and year of the latest revised printing, if any. Nearby will be listed the dates of the latest NGA Notice to Mariners and USCG Local Notice to Mariners through which the chart has been corrected; see Figure 15-11. These dates may be several weeks prior to the printing date due to the time required for printing after the final data input; they are provided to indicate to the user the starting point for keeping the new edition corrected from Notices. Most NOS charts are printed to supply a normal demand of one or two years for active areas, and from four to twelve years in areas where few changes occur. (Print-on-demand charts will carry additional dates indicating the more recent application of information from Notices and other sources; see this page.)

Figure 15-11 The edition number and date (month and year) of each NOS chart are printed at the lower-left corner. Also shown are the numbers and dates of the last Notice to Mariners and Local Notice to Mariners that were used when that edition was prepared. Print-on-demand charts will also show the number and date of the most recent Notice and Local Notice that subsequently provided additional corrections.

Charts may be printed as-is when the stock runs low, but a revised print is more likely if a new edition is not published. Revisions include all changes that have been printed in Notices to Mariners since the last revision. When major changes occur, such as significant differences between charted depths and actual conditions revealed by new surveys, a new edition will be published. This will also include all other changes that have been made in aids to navigation, shore-side features, etc.

All currently published NOS charts are now compiled using an automated information system. Every item of information on the chart—every symbol, abbreviation, sounding, line, color, everything—is stored on magnetic media as bits of digital data. Negatives for the printing of each color are made by laser beams controlled by a computer. Since a digital database is easily updated, the revision of charts for new editions is becoming an easier and faster process as this technique is extended to all NOS charts. Digitizing also allows downloading of data to electronic charts.

Use only the latest edition of a chart. All new editions supersede older issues, which should be discarded. New editions contain information published in Notices to Mariners and Local Notices to Mariners. They also include other corrections from extensive application of hydrographic and topographic surveys considered essential for safe navigation but not published in the Notices. To ensure that you know what are the latest editions, check the small NOS booklet Dates of Latest Editions, issued quarterly and found at local sales agents for charts and other NOS publications; this is also available online at https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/charts/list-of-latest-editions.html and is updated daily.

Between editions, correct your own charts from information published in Notices to Mariners and Local Notices to Mariners (see this page). Charts kept in stock by the National Ocean Service or sales agents while awaiting sale are not updated or corrected before sale. When you buy a new chart, check all Notices subsequent to the printed edition date and enter all applicable corrections. Changes for NOS charts are also available on the Internet; searches can be made by chart number or by Coast Guard District (but not smaller geographic area). Go to https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov and link from there (files may be quite large; a high-speed connection is desirable). Changes for NGA charts may be derived from U.S. Notices to Mariners, available online at https://msi.nga.mil/NTM. For Local Notices to Mariners go to www.navcen.uscg.gov.

### Latitude & Longitude Scales

Conventional nautical charts have the geographical north direction toward the top of the sheet, unlike some small-craft charts and chart books that may be oriented to follow the general direction of a river or the coastline without respect to north. Such conventional charts have latitude scales in each side border and longitude scales in the top and bottom borders. Meridians and parallels are drawn across the chart as fine black lines, usually at 2-, 5-, or 10-minute intervals as determined by the scale of the particular chart.

On NOS charts with a scale of 1:50,000 and larger, such as on harbor charts, the subdivisions in the border scales are in terms of minutes and seconds of latitude and longitude; see Figure 15-12.

Figure 15-12 On charts at scales of 1:40,000 or larger, latitude and longitude scales are subdivided into minutes and seconds. This extract from a harbor chart shows meridians drawn at 5-minute intervals, tick marks at 1-minute intervals, and a 1-minute interval subdivided into 5-second units. Note the ten 1-second longitude units at the right of the 19′ figure.

On small-scale charts, the subdivisions are in minutes and fractions of minutes—charts at a scale of 1:80,000 use minutes and tenths of minutes; see Figure 15-13. Even smaller-scale charts use minutes and fifths or halves, or even full minutes.

Figure 15-13 On charts of relatively small scale, the latitude and longitude border markings are in minutes and decimal fractions of minutes. On this 1:80,000 chart, meridians are drawn at 10-minute intervals; subdivisions are in minutes and tenths of minutes. On smaller scale charts, the smallest sub-divisions might be fifths, halves, or whole minutes.

Where skewed projections are used and North is not at the top of the sheet, such as on small-craft charts of the Intracoastal Waterway, divisions of latitude and longitude are indicated along parallels and meridians at several convenient places, and/or separately near the graphic distance scales.

### Use of Color on Charts

Nearly all charts use color to emphasize various features and so facilitate reading and interpretation. The colors vary with the agency publishing the chart and its intended use.

The NOS uses five multipurpose colors in either solid color or shades—black, magenta, gold, blue, and green. Land areas are a screened tint of gold (urban or built-up areas are often shown in a darker screened tint of that color); water areas are white (the color of the paper), except for the shallower regions, which are shown in a screened blue. Areas that are submerged at some tidal stages but uncovered at others, such as sand bars, mud flats, coral reefs, and marshes, are green. On some charts, water areas that have been swept with wire drags to ensure the absence of isolated rocks or coral heads may be shown by a screened green with the depth of the sweep indicated.

Magenta ink is used for many purposes on charts; it has good visibility under red light, which is used for reading charts during the hours of darkness, because it does not destroy night vision as white light does. Red buoys are printed in magenta, as are red daybeacon symbols. Lighted buoys of any color have a magenta disc over the small circle portion of the symbol to assist in identifying it as a lighted aid. A magenta flare symbol extending from a position dot (much like an exclamation mark) is used with lights, lighted ranges, etc. Caution and danger symbols and notes are printed in magenta; also compass roses, usually, and recommended courses where shown. Black is used for most symbols, contour lines, man-made features, and printed information.

The use of colors on NGA charts is generally the same as described above for NOS charts, except that gray (screened black) is used for land areas.

### Lettering Styles

To convey as much information as possible in the clearest form, certain classes of information are printed in one style of lettering and other classes in another style. By knowing what type of lettering is used for which class of information, you can more easily and quickly grasp the data being presented.

Vertical lettering is used for features on NOS charts that are dry at high water and not affected by movement of the water (except for the height of the feature above the water, which may be changed by tidal action). See the use of vertical lettering for the landmark stacks and spires, and the horn signal in Figure 15-14. Depth information also uses vertical numbers.

Figure 15-14 This excerpt illustrates the distinction between vertical lettering for features that are above the water—such as “STACK” and “SPIRE” in contrast to leaning (italic) letters for underwater features, such as “Wks” for wrecks and “Obstn” for an unidentified obstruction.

Slant (italic) letters, such as those in Figure 15-14, are used for water, underwater, and floating features, except depth figures. Note also the use in Figure 15-14 of slanted lettering for bottom features and buoy characteristics.

On smaller-scale charts, a small reef (covering and uncovering with tidal action) often cannot be distinguished by symbol from a small islet (always above water); the proper name for either might be “_____ Rock.” The feature in doubt is an islet if the name is in vertical letters, but is a reef if lettered in slanting characters. (The small reef would be indicated by a symbol that resembles an asterisk. A small islet would be exaggerated if far enough from shore and filled in with a gold tint.)

Similarly, a piling visible above water at all tidal stages is charted as “Pile,” but one beneath the surface is noted as “Subm pile.”

Periods after abbreviations are omitted in water and in land areas, but lower-case “i” and “j” are dotted. Periods are used only where needed for clarity, as, for example, in certain notes.

### Water Features

The information shown on charts is a combination of the natural features of the water and land areas and various selected man-made objects and features. Each item shown is carefully chosen for its value to those who navigate vessels of all sizes.

#### Depths

The principal feature of concern to boaters is the depth. For any system of depth information there must be a reference plane, or datum. This is obvious in coastal areas, where depths may change hourly as a result of tidal action; it is likewise true in inland areas where lake or river levels may also change, though more slowly on a seasonal basis. Each chart has on it a statement of the datum from which all depths, also called soundings, are measured. The choice of the reference plane is based on many factors, most of them technical, but the primary consideration is that of selecting a datum near to normal low-water levels.

Planes of Reference On NOS charts the datum for the depths is mean lower low water; this is of greatest significance in areas such as the Pacific Coast, where each tidal day has two low tides of different heights; refer to Figure 17-06. However, this datum is now on all NOS charts.

By definition, “mean lower low water” is an average of all lowest water levels for tidal days over a period of time (usually 19 years). Thus on some days the lower low tide will be below the datum. This will result in actual depths being shallower than the charted figures. Many charts will have a small box with a tabulation of the extreme variations from charted depths that may be expected for various points; see Figure 15-15.

Figure 15-15 Coast and harbor charts often carry information on the normal range of tides, and the extreme variations from charted depths that may be expected. Check all newly purchased charts for this important information.

Prolonged winds from certain directions, or persistent extremes of barometric pressure, may cause temporary local differences from charted depths. Remember that there are exceptional conditions at which times the water may be much shallower than indicated on the chart.

The datum for water depths on the Great Lakes and other inland bodies of water is an arbitrarily established plane, usually at or near long-term low averages. This datum will be clearly indicated on the chart.

#### How Depths Are Shown

Depth information is shown on a chart by many small printed figures. These indicate the depth at that point, usually measured in feet or fathoms. Some newer U.S. charts, and many of other nations, have depth measured in meters and decimeters (tenths of a meter). The printed depth figures are only a very small fraction of the many soundings taken by the survey team.

Only the more significant and representative depth data are selected for use on the final chart. A skipper can form some opinion of the characteristics of the bottom by noting the density of the depth information. Where depth figures are rather widely spaced, he can be assured of a reasonably flat or uniformly sloping bottom. Wherever the depths vary irregularly or abruptly, the figures will be more frequent and more closely spaced.

Depth Curves Most charts will have contour lines, usually called depth curves, connecting points of equal depth. Such lines will appear at certain depths as determined by the scale of the chart, the relative range of depths, and the type of vessel expected to use the chart. Typically, depth curves are shown for 6, 12, 18, 30, and 60 feet, and multiples of 60 feet (note the relationship to fathoms). Depth curves are shown as continuous solid lines with depth labels or various combinations of dots and dashes to code the depth along each line, but it is often easier to learn a line’s significance by inspection of the depth figures on either side of it.

On many charts, a blue tint is shown in water areas out to the curve that is considered to be the danger curve for the majority of important marine traffic that is expected to use that particular chart. In general, the 6-foot curve is considered the danger curve for small-craft and Intracoastal Waterway charts; see Figure 15-16. The 12- or 18-foot curve is considered the danger curve for harbor charts, and the 30-foot curve for coast and general charts. (These types of charts are discussed in more detail on this page.) On some of the latter charts, the area beyond the 18-foot curves may be tinted in a lighter shade of blue than the shallower areas. Thus, while blue tint means shallow water, this coloring does not have exactly the same meaning on all charts. Check each chart you plan to use to determine at just what depth the coloring changes.

Figure 15-16 This inshore chart shows depth curves at 6, 12, and 18 feet. The blue tint emphasizes the 6-foot line and indicates dangerous shallow water.

Isolated offshore areas that have depths corresponding to the tinted areas of alongshore waters will also be tinted in the appropriate shade of blue.

Charts without depth curves or dashed curves must be used with caution, as soundings may be too scarce to allow the lines to be drawn accurately.

Avoid an isolated sounding that is shallower than surrounding depths, particularly with a solid or dotted line ring (depth curve) around it, as it may be doubtful how closely the spot has been examined and whether the least depth has been found.

#### Dredged Channels

Dredged channels are shown on a chart by two dashed lines to represent the side limits of the improvement. The channel’s depth and the date on which such data were obtained are often shown within the lines or close alongside; refer to Figure 15-14. A dredged basin will be similarly outlined with printed information on depths and date. The depth shown, such as “6 Feet Oct 2009,” is the controlling depth through the channel on the date shown, but this depth may not exist over the full width of the channel; sometimes the stated depth is only “on centerline.”

Channels are sometimes described by width as well as depth; for example, “8 Feet for a Width of 100 Feet”; a date for this information is often included. Depths may have subsequently changed from shoaling or further dredging, so if your boat’s draft is close to the depth shown for the channel, get local information, if you can, before entering. Detailed information for many dredged channels is shown in tabular form on applicable charts, with revisions of the data published in Notices to Mariners or Local Notices to Mariners as changes occur. Coast Pilots (see this page) also include information on dredged channels and basins.

#### Nature of the Bottom

The nature of the bottom, such as sand, rock, mud, grass, or “hard” or “soft,” is indicated for many areas by abbreviations. This information is especially valuable when you are anchoring, so take advantage of it wherever it appears. The meanings of these and other abbreviations are usually given on the face of the chart near the basic identification block; many are self-evident.

#### The Shoreline

The shoreline shown on charts is the mean high-water line for tidal areas; it is the high-water line in lakes and nontidal areas, except in marsh or mangrove areas where the outer edge of vegetation is used. Natural shoreline is represented by a slightly heavier line than man-made shoreline. Unsurveyed shoreline, or shoreline connecting two surveys that do not join satisfactorily, is shown by a dashed line. The low-water line is marked by a single row of dots. The outer limits of marsh are indicated by a fine solid line. The region between the high- and low-water lines is tinted green, and may be labeled “Marsh,” “Grass,” “Mud,” “Sand,” etc.

### Features of Land Areas

Features and characteristics of land areas are shown on nautical charts in only such detail as will assist a navigator on the water. Details are usually confined to those near the shoreline or of such a prominent nature as to be clearly visible for some distance offshore.

#### How Topography Is Shown

The general topography of land areas is indicated by contours, form lines, or hachures. Contours are lines connecting points of equal elevation. Their specific height, usually measured in feet, may be shown by figures placed at suitable points along the lines. The interval of height between adjacent contours is uniform over any one chart. On NOS charts of tidal areas, heights are measured from a different datum than depths; usually this is Mean High Water; in nontidal areas, the same datum is established for both depths and heights.

Form lines, or sketch contours, are shown by broken lines and are contour approximations meant to indicate terrain formations without giving exact information on height. They are used in areas where accurate data are not available to do otherwise. The interval between form lines is not necessarily uniform, and no height figures are given.

Hachures are short lines or groups of lines that indicate the approximate location of steep slopes. The lines follow the general direction of the slope, with the length of the lines indicating the height of the slope.

#### Cliffs, Vegetation & the Shore

Cliffs are represented by bands of irregular hachures. The symbol is not an exact “plan view,” but rather somewhat of a “side elevation”; its extent is roughly proportional to the height of the cliff. For example, a perpendicular cliff of 100 feet height will be shown by a hachured band wider than one representing a cliff of 15 feet with slope.

Spot elevations are normally given on nautical charts only for summits or the tops of conspicuous landmarks; see Figure 15-17.

Figure 15-17 Landforms are shown by contour lines, and the tops of conspicuous landmarks are identified by height and name. Note the Loran-C time-difference lines overprinted in magenta; Loran-C has been discontinued, and TD curves have disappeared from current NOS charts.

The type of vegetation on land will sometimes be indicated by symbols or wording where this information may be useful to mariners.

The nature of the shore is sometimes indicated by various symbols—rows of fine dots denote a sandy beach, small circles indicate gravel, or irregular shapes mean boulders.

### Man-Made Features

Man-made features on land are shown in detail to the extent that they can be useful to water-borne traffic. Examples are piers, bridges, overhead power cables, and breakwaters. Other man-made features on land, such as built-up areas, roads, and streets, may be shown in some detail or generalized as determined by their usefulness to navigation and the scale of the chart. On large-scale charts the network of streets may be shown, with public buildings such as the post office and customhouse identified; see Figure 15-18, upper. On less detailed charts, the town or city may be represented by a cross-hatched or more heavily screened area for the approximate limits of the built-up area, with major streets and road shown by single heavy lines; see Figure 15-18, lower.

Figure 15-18 On large-scale charts (upper), detailed information may be shown of the streets and buildings of a city or town, particularly near the waterfront. Some street names may be given. On smaller-scale charts (lower), cities, towns, and built-up areas are indicated by cross-hatching, as shown, or by heavier screening that shows up as a darker, but not black, area. Single heavy lines indicate principal roads.

Locations of prominent isolated objects, tanks, stacks, spires, etc., are shown accurately so they may be used for taking bearings.

Specific descriptive names have been given to certain types of landmark objects to standardize terminology. Among the more often used are the following:

• Building or house—the appropriate term is used when the entire structure is a landmark, rather than any individual feature of it.

• Chimney—a relatively small projection for conveying smoke from a building to the atmosphere. This term is used when the building is more prominent than the chimney, but a better bearing can be taken on the smaller feature.

• Cupola—a dome-shaped tower or turret rising from a building, generally small in comparison with the building.

• Dome—a large, rounded, hemispherical structure rising above a building; for example, the dome of the United States Capitol in Washington.

• Flagpole—a single staff from which flags are displayed. This term is used when the pole is not attached to a building.

• Flagstaff—a flagpole arising from a building.

• Lookout station or watch tower—a tower surmounted by a small house from which a watch is regularly kept.

• Radio mast—a relatively short pole or slender structure for elevating ratio antennas; usually found in groups.

• Radio tower—a tall pole or structure for elevating ratio antennas.

• Spire—a slender, pointed structure extending above a building. It is seldom less than two-thirds of the entire height of the structure, and its lines are rarely broken by intermediate structures. Spires are typically found on churches.

• Stack—a tall smokestack or chimney. This term is used when the stack is more prominent as a landmark than the accompanying buildings.

• Standpipe—a tall cylindrical structure whose height is several times it diameter.

• Tank—a water tank elevated high above ground by a tall skeleton framework. Gas tank and oil tank are terms used for distinctive structures of specialized design, and are usually lower than a water tank and not supported by a skeleton framework.

• Tower—any structure with its base on the ground and high in proportion to its base, or that part of a structure higher than the rest, but having essentially vertical sides for the greater part of its height.

• Tree—an isolated, conspicuous tree useful as a navigational landmark (seldom used).

Bridges over navigable waterways are shown with the type of bridge—bascule, swing, suspension, etc.—and both horizontal and vertical clearances in feet, the latter measured from mean high water (or other plane of reference used for heights of objects). Vertical clearance for drawbridges is stated as the height available at the lowest point over the channel; this “low steel” figure for arched bridges may be supplemented by a sign indicating the amount of additional clearance available at the center. Some bridges will have a sign merely stating “Clearance at Center.”

When two similar objects are so located that separate landmark symbols cannot be used, the word “twin” is added to the identifying name or abbreviation. When only one of a group of similar objects is charted, a descriptive legend is added in parentheses; for example “(tallest of four)” or “(northeast of three).”

Radio broadcasting station (AM) antennas are shown on charts where they may be used for taking visual bearings. The call letters and frequency are often shown adjacent to the symbol marking the location of the towers.

Stacks, radio towers, and other tall towers are required to have lights to indicate their presence to aircraft. When these lights are useful for marine navigation, they appear on charts as “FR,” “Occ R,” or “Fl R”; see this page. Also, there are structures with multiple, very-high-intensity, very-short-flash lights that are charted as “Strobe.” These are visible in daylight as well as at night and eliminate the need for the tower or stack to be painted with alternating red and white bands.

## SYMBOLS & ABBREVIATIONS

The vast amount of information shown on a chart, and the closeness of many items, necessitate an extensive use of symbols and abbreviations. You should be familiar with all symbols and abbreviations on the charts you use. You must be able to read and interpret your charts quickly and accurately; the safety of your boat may depend on this ability.

### International Standards

Chart symbols are conventional shapes and designs indicating the presence of a certain feature or object at the location shown. No attempt is made at an accurate or detailed representation of the object, but the correct location is shown. Symbols and abbreviations used on NOS and NGA charts are standardized and appear in a 110-page booklet called Chart No. 1; see Figure 15-19. This is available for download at https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/us-chart-1.html and in facsimile or editorially enhanced printed editions from chart agents and commercial publishers. The symbols and abbreviations are in general conformance with worldwide usage as adopted by the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).

Figure 15-19 Chart No. 1 is not really a “chart” at all. It is a most useful booklet showing all chart symbols used on U.S. charts and the charts of other national jurisdictions. It is available online for downloading.

This page through this page are taken from Chart No. 1. This page shows the standard features of a chart; this page shows the schema of Chart No. 1; and this page show a few of the more vital and frequently used symbols. Buoy, daybeacon, and light symbology is discussed and illustrated in Chapter 14.

### Basic Symbols & Abbreviations

Simple inspection of many symbols will reveal a pattern in the way that they are formed. If you know the general principles of chart symbols, you’ll have an easier time learning the details.

#### Buoys

Buoys, except mooring buoys, are shown by a diamond-shaped symbol and a small open circle indicating the position. (A circle is used rather than a position dot in recognition of the fact that a buoy will swing about its anchor on a length of chain.) To avoid interference with other features on the chart, it is often necessary to show the diamond shapes at various angles to the circle; the orientation of the diamond shape has no significance.

On charts using the normal number of colors, red buoys are printed in magenta; the letter “R” may also be shown adjacent to the symbol. Green buoys are shown in that color with the letter “G” nearby. See this page.

A buoy symbol with a line across its shorter axis indicates a horizontally banded buoy. For a junction buoy both colors are used; magenta (for red) over green, or green over magenta, as the buoy itself is painted. The letters “RG” or “GR,” respectively, appear near the symbol.

An open buoy symbol with a line across its longer axis represents a vertically striped buoy. No colors are used on this symbol; the colors are indicated by the abbreviation “RW” for red and white.

Special-purpose buoys are shown by an open, uncolored symbol and the letter “Y.”

The type and shape of unlighted buoys is normally indicated by an abbreviation such as “C” for can or “N” for nun.

Because they are a potential hazard to navigation, “superbuoys” are charted with a special symbol; see Figure 15-20. This category includes exposed location buoys, offshore data collection buoys, and buoys for mooring tankers offshore while loading or unloading.

Figure 15-20 Special chart symbols are used to indicate the position of large automatic navigation buoys, tanker terminal buoys, and ocean data buoys—all types known as “superbuoys.”

Lighted buoys are indicated by a small magenta disc over the small circle that marks the buoy’s position. The color and rhythm of the light, and the “hull” colors are indicated by abbreviations near the symbol.

#### Daybeacons

The symbol for daybeacons—unlighted fixed aids to navigation—may be either a small triangle or square. See this page.

The square symbol, colored green and with the letter “G” nearby, is used for daybeacons that have a solid green dayboard of this shape.

The triangle symbol, colored magenta and with the letter “R” nearby, is used for daybeacons with solid red dayboards of this shape.

The symbol for a daybeacon with red-over-green triangular daymarks is an open triangle with the letters “RG”; for a daybeacon with green-over-red square daymarks it is an open square symbol with the letters “GR.” The symbol for an articulated daybeacon is the usual square or triangle with a small circle added to the bottom as in Figure 15-20, plus a label “ART.”

All octagonal, diamond-shaped, round, or rectangular daymarks will be represented by open square symbols and letter abbreviations as appropriate for the colors concerned.

#### Lights, All Types

The chart symbol for lights of all sizes—from the simple light on a single pile in inland waters to the largest of primary seacoast lights—is the same. This is a black position dot with a magenta “flare” giving much the appearance of a large exclamation mark. In addition to color and characteristics, there may be information on the height of the light and its nominal range. See this page.

The symbol for an articulated light combines the small circle of the buoy symbol and the magenta flare for a fixed light.

#### Fog Signals

The type of fog signal on buoys and lights so equipped is indicated by a descriptive word or abbreviation adjacent to the chart symbol.

#### Identification by Number

Buoys and lights are usually numbered (or less frequently, designated with letters or combinations of letters and numbers). This identification is placed on the chart near the symbol and is enclosed in quotation marks to distinguish the figures from depth data or other numbers. Primary and some secondary lights are named; the words, abbreviated as necessary, are printed near the symbol where space permits.

#### Ranges

Ranges are indicated by the two symbols of the front and rear markers (lights or daybeacons), plus a line joining them and extending beyond. This line is solid only over the distance for which the range is to be used for navigation; it continues on as a dashed line to the front marker and on to the rear marker; see Figures 14-22 and 15-21. The point where the line changes may or may not be marked by an aid to navigation.

Figure 15-21 Ranges are excellent aids to navigation; they are charted by showing the front and rear marks (lighted or unlighted) with a line between them that denotes the range. The line is solid over the portion that is to be navigated and dashed where it should not be followed.

#### Dangers to Navigation

Symbols are also used for many types of dangers to navigation. Differentiation is made between rocks that are awash at times and those that remain below the surface at all tides, and between hazards that have been definitely located and those whose position is doubtful. There are a number of symbols and abbreviations for objects and areas dangerous to navigation. Spend adequate time studying them, with emphasis on the types commonly found in your home waters or where you intend to cruise.

#### Accuracy & Precision Problems

The art and science of navigation has been affected by advances in technology. The most obvious of these is the Global Positioning System, or GPS). The widespread, nearly universal use of GPS for locating a vessel’s position has put mariners in a counterintuitive predicament. In parts of the South Pacific and other less thoroughly charted regions, a GPS position can be more accurate than the technology that was used to put soundings and features on the chart. This is especially true when a Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) capability is used.

This discrepancy is even more pronounced when the chart scale is taken into consideration. The width of a line on a paper chart is typically 0.1 to 1.5 millimeter (0.004 to 0.06 inch). A feature’s actual position can fall anywhere within its line or symbol. Thus, on a typical 1:40,000 harbor chart, a feature could have a potential error of at least 40 to 80 meters (130 to 260 feet) due to scale alone; a line plotted on a chart would have a similar range of possible error. DGPS errors do not normally exceed a few meters (10 to 15 feet), and are often less. This is often the cause of the “ship on pier situation” in which a vessel made fast to a pier shows on an electronic navigation system as being on the pier rather than alongside it.

## CHART NUMBERING SYSTEM

All NOS and NGA charts are numbered in a common system. This is based on regions and subregions. Boaters will generally be concerned only with charts having five-digit numbers; such charts have a scale of 1:2,000,000 or larger. The first digit refers to a region of the world, and the second, together with the first, to a subregion; the final three digits are assigned systematically within the subregion to denote the specific chart.

Region 1 includes the waters in and around the United States and Canada. Region 2 covers Central and South America, Mexico, the Bahamas, and the West Indies.

Region 1 has nine subregions designated counterclockwise around North American from Subregion 11 for the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Coast up to Cape Hatteras. Subregion 12 extends to the eastern tip of Long Island, and 13 goes on to the Canadian border. Subregion 14 covers the Great Lakes; Subregion 18 is the U.S. Pacific Coast; Subregion 19 covers the Hawaiian Islands and adjacent waters. Figure 15-22 shows the regions and subregions of the world.

Figure 15-22 This diagram shows the chart regions and subregions of the world. Region 1 covers the United States and Canada. The number of the subregion forms the first two digits of a five-digit chart number.

The final three digits of a five-digit number are assigned counterclockwise around the subregion or along the coast. Many numbers are skipped over and left unassigned so that future charts can be fitted into the system.

### The Five NOS Chart Series

As previously mentioned, charts are published in a wide range of scales. For general convenience of reference, the NOS has classified charts into “series” as follows:

• Sailing Charts—The smallest-scale charts covering long stretches of coastline; for example, Cape Sable, Newfoundland, to Cape Hatteras, NC; or the Gulf of Mexico; or San Francisco to Cape Flattery, Washington; see Figure 15-23. The charts of this series are published at scales of 1:600,001 or smaller. Sailing charts are prepared for the use of the navigator in fixing his position as he approaches the coast from open ocean or when sailing between distant ports. They show offshore soundings, principal lights and outer buoys, and landmarks visible at great distances. Long-distance ocean racers often use the charts in this series, but the average boater will find little use for them except perhaps to plot the paths of hurricanes and other tropical disturbances.

Figure 15-23 A portion of sailing chart 13003, Cape Sable, Nova Scotia, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, scale 1:1,200,000 (1 inch equals 16.46 nautical miles). This chart is used for far offshore passages; it shows very little detail of inshore aids to navigation. The entrance to Chesapeake Bay is just above the middle of this chart extract.

• General Charts—The second series comprises charts with scales in the range of 1:150,001 to 1:600,000. These cover more limited areas, such as Cape May, NJ to Cape Hatteras, NC; or the Mississippi River to Galveston Bay; or San Francisco to Point Arena, CA. General charts are intended for coastwise navigation outside of offshore reefs and shoals when the vessel’s course is mostly within sight of land and her position can be fixed by landmarks, lights, buoys, and soundings; see Figure 15-24.

Figure 15-24 General chart 12200, Cap May to Cape Hatteras, scale 1:419,706 (1 inch equals 5.76 nautical miles). This chart does not extend as far offshore, and would be used for the initial approach from sea toward Chesapeake Bay Entrance; additional details of aids to navigation are shown.

• Coast Charts—this next larger-scale series consists of charts for close-in coastwise navigation, for entering and leaving harbors, and for navigating large inland bodies of water. The scales used range from 1:50,001 to 1:150,000, with most at 1:80,000; see Figure 15-25. Typical examples of coast charts are the series of five that cover Chesapeake Bay or 18746, which takes the California skipper from Long Beach or Newport to Santa Catalina Island and back. The average boater may use several charts from this series.

Figure 15-25 Coast chart 12221, Chesapeake Bay Entrance, scale 1:80,000. This chart gives details of the water depths, hazards, aids to navigation, etc., within the coastline. Its scale of 1 inch equals 1.10 nautical miles would be suitable for navigating into the bay.

• Harbor Charts—This is the largest-scale and most detailed series; see Figure 15-26. Scales range from 1:50,000 and larger, with an occasional inset of even larger scale. The scale used is determined by the need for showing detail and by the area to be covered by a single sheet.

Figure 15-26 Harbor chart 12222, Cape Charles to Norfolk Harbor, scale 1:40,000 (1 inch equals 0.55 nautical mile). This chart shows all details of the water and aids to navigation. It can be used for piloting down channels and to anchorages.

• Small-Craft charts—These compact charts provide the small-craft skipper with a convenient, folded-format, small-size chart designed primarily for use in confined spaces; see Figure 15-27. One of the formats is designed to cover long, narrow waterways; another is a folded multipage chart covering larger areas. All small-craft charts include a tabulation of public marine facilities, tide tables, weather information sources, and similar data of particular value to boaters. This small-craft series is described in greater detail below.

Figure 15-27 For use on small boats, particularly open boats, a small-craft chart has many advantages over a large, sheet-like conventional chart. The SC chart can be easily opened only to the area of immediate interest, and it includes such additional information as facility data and tidal predictions.

#### Stowage & Use

NOS charts in the first four series above are printed by accurate techniques on highly durable paper. Individual charts range in size from about 19 x 26 to 36 x 54 inches. (483 x 660 to 914 x 1,372 mm). Some U.S. charts are now printed in the international standard size of 841 x 1,189 mm (33.1 x 46.8 inches). They are among the navigator’s most important tools, so should be given careful handling and proper stowage. If circumstances permit, they should be stowed flat or rolled, and in a dry place. Charts of this type should not be folded, if this can be avoided.

Make any permanent corrections in ink so they will not be inadvertently erased; make all other lines and notations lightly in pencil so they may be erased without damaging the chart.

### Selecting the Proper Chart

From a consideration of the five categories of charts discussed above, you can see that most boating areas will appear on two charts of different series, and that some areas will be covered by three or four charts of different scales. Such charts will vary widely in the extent of the area covered and the amount of detail shown. Choosing the proper chart for your use is important. In general, the closer you are to shoal water and dangers to navigation, the larger you will want the scale of your chart.

#### What Coast Charts Show

Coast charts show the major hazards and aids to navigation and give general information on depths. Some charts in this series entirely omit any details in certain areas that are covered by larger-scale charts. For example, Narragansett Bay appears on Chart 13218, but no details at all are given, merely a small note “(Chart 13221).” Other coast charts include in their area coverage portions of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway, but the navigator is referred to the ICW route charts for all information on the inland route. Many coast charts include a small diagram outlining the areas covered by each larger-scale chart. On Chart 13218, this amounts to all portions of 13 more-detailed charts.

#### What Harbor Charts Show

Harbor charts show more numerous soundings and all aids to navigation, and permit the most accurate fixing of position from plotted bearings. The question may be asked: why ever select any but the largest-scale chart? The answer lies in the fact that as the scale is increased, the area covered is proportionately decreased. Thus for a given cruise, many more charts from the harbor series would be required than from the coast series. Further, in some areas continuous coverage from port to port is not possible with harbor charts alone. Yet another problem is that the increased number of harbor charts would complicate the task of laying out a long run between ports.

Selecting the proper charts will usually mean that you have a mixture of coast charts for the longer runs and harbor charts for entering ports and exploring up rivers and creeks. For some areas, you will find it useful to have one or more general charts in addition to the coast and harbor charts. For example, the best overall route up Chesapeake Bay is more easily plotted on one general chart, 12280, than on a series of five coast charts, 12221 to 12273. The coast charts will be desirable for the actual trip, however, when used with some harbor charts.

In the margin of many charts, you will find helpful information regarding the next chart to use when you are going in a particular direction. This note will take the form of a statement such as “Joins Chart 13233” or “Continued on Chart 13236.”

### Small-Craft Charts

The charts in the first four series discussed above are referred to as “conventional charts” and are intended for flat or rolled storage. The fifth series, small-craft charts, is quite different, designed for more convenient use in the limited space available on boats, and for folded storage; refer to Figure 15-27. There are approximately 90 small-craft charts, each numbered in the normal five-digit style.

#### Types of Small-Craft Charts

Small-craft charts are printed in three general formats termed folio, area, and route as follows:

Small-craft folio charts, consisting of three or four sheets printed front and back, accordion-folded, and bound in a suitable cover.

Small-craft area charts, usually consisting of a conventional chart printed on lighter-weight paper with additional data for the small boat skipper. Half the chart is printed on each side of the paper with a slight area of overlap.

Small-craft route charts, consisting of a single sheet printed front and back.

Route and area charts are designed in a 5-inch-by-10-inch pocket-fold format without a cover jacket. All information once shown on the separate jackets is now included on the margins of the chart itself. The elimination of the jacket allows a lower price.

#### Facilities Data

A unique feature of small-craft charts is the variety of data printed on the chart or the protective jacket; see Figure 15-28. Repair yard and marina locations are clearly marked on the chart, and the available services and supplies are tabulated. A tide table for the year, marine weather information, Rules of the Road, whistle signals, and warning notes are included for ready reference.

Figure 15-28 Table on a small-craft chart lists the tide ranges, depths, and the services and supplies available at marine facilities in the area covered. The numbers at the left are keyed to locations on the chart.

Small-craft charts make frequent use of insets to show such features as small creeks and harbors in greater detail at a larger scale. Figure 15-29 shows an inset from Chart 11467 showing waters just south of Miami, Florida.

Figure 15-29 Insets are frequently used on small-craft charts to show specific areas at a larger scale with greater details. The inset, right, from Chart 11467 of the ICW in the Miami, Florida area, is typical. On these charts water areas with depths less than 6 feet are shown in blue; aids to navigation are in green and magenta.

#### Courses Indicated

Many of the folio and route types of small-craft charts indicate a recommended track to be followed. The longer stretches of these tracks are marked as to true course and distance in miles and tenths. Route charts of the Intracoastal Waterway also have numbered marks every five statute miles indicating the accumulated distance southward from Norfolk, Virginia, to Florida, and eastward and westward from Harvey Lock, Louisiana (also westward across the Okeechobee Waterway and northward along the Florida Gulf Coast); see Figure 15-30. Facilities along the ICW are designated in accordance with a numbering system that starts over again with “1” on each chart of the series.

Figure 15-30 Charts of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway show a fine magenta line that indicates the route to be followed. Tick marks are placed at five-mile intervals along this course line and are labeled with the accumulated mileage (statute) south from Norfolk, Virginia. The “D—D” line on this excerpt is a matching line to facilitate shifting to the adjoining Intracoastal Waterway chart.

#### Periodic Revision

Charts are no longer hand-corrected by the NOS after they are printed and placed in stock. Check the publication Dates of Latest Editions (at sales agents or online at https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/charts/list-of-latest-editions.html) to be sure you are using the latest chart. Keep your chart up-to-date between editions by applying all critical changes published in Notices to Mariners and Local Notices to Mariners. This is not a great chore, if you keep up with the changes and don’t get behind.

Print-on-demand charts (see this page) are fully corrected up to the date of purchase. New editions are available two to eight weeks before traditional printed charts.

#### Other Charts for Small Craft

Modified route charts are identical in construction and format with small-craft area charts and are used in areas that are not adaptable to the route chart style used for long, narrow waterways.

The NOAA Print-on-Demand project offers three new products for use on small craft; the MapFold Chart, the PocketChart, and the BookletChart are described on this page.

Marine facilities charts are conventional charts with small-craft facility information overprinted on the chart and tabulated on the reverse side.

Canoe charts covering the Minnesota—Ontario Border Lakes are designed to meet the needs of operators of small, shallow-draft craft.

### Great Lake Charts

Polyconic projections (see this page) are used for most of the NOS charts of the Great Lakes; a few smaller-scale charts are also published in Mercator projection editions, as are all those published in metric editions. Other small variations between these and coastal charts may be noted. Often courses and distances (in statue miles) will be shown for runs between important points.

On the Great Lakes and connecting waters, special editions of charts for small craft are available for a number of boating areas. These are bound into recreational chart booklets with individual charts at various scales.

### NGA Charts

Charts from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency are used by skippers making long ocean voyages or visiting waters of other nations (except Canada). The way of showing information does not differ much from the more familiar NOS charts; symbols and abbreviations will be familiar to the coastal boater, but land areas are shaded gray rather than gold. Symbols are different for lighted buoys and those with radar reflectors. Most charts based on non-U.S. sources will show depths and heights in meters and fractions, rather than in feet or fathoms; increasingly, NGA-originated charts will also use metric units.

NGA—and its predecessor agencies, NIMA and DMAHTC—have published special editions for some of the major ocean sailing races. These are regular editions of the applicable charts overprinted with additional information for the yachtsman, including the direct rhumb line, typical sailing tracks for seasonal winds, additional current data, and other useful items. These charts are listed in the section on Miscellaneous Charts and Publications in NGA Chart Catalog (see Appendix A).

Remember that many NGA charts are based on surveys done by other nations; see Figure 15-31. The authority for the charted information is always given, as is the date of the surveys.

Figure 15-31 Many charts issued by NGA are based on surveys done by other nations, frequently decades or even centuries ago. This is noted in the chart’s title block. Such charts should be used with caution if the surveys are many years in the past.

### Inland River Charts & Maps

Boaters on inland rivers use charts that differ in many respects from those used in coastal waters. Often the inland river charts are issued in book form with several pages covering successive stretches of a river; frequently, they are called “navigational maps.”

Probably the most obvious difference is the usual lack of depth figures. In lieu of these, there is generally a broken line designating the route to be followed. To make the best use of each paper sheet, pages may be oriented differently; North is seldom toward the top, and its actual direction is shown by an arrow. Some symbols may vary slightly in appearance from those on “saltwater” charts, and additional ones may be used as required by local conditions. Distances are stated in terms of statute miles, and locations are described in distances upriver from a specified origin point.

More detailed information on river charts will be found in Chapter 22; see this page. An extensive listing of where river charts and related publications can be obtained will be found in Appendix A.

### Bathymetric Charts

Charts designed to give maximum emphasis to the configuration of the bottom show depths by depth contours similar to contours shown on land areas to indicate graduations in height. These are called bathymetric charts.

## CHART PROJECTIONS

You can safely navigate your boat without knowledge of the various types of projection used in the preparation of charts. As in almost any field, however, greater knowledge will assist in understanding and using nautical charts. Hence the following paragraphs offer additional information on chart projections (which are actually mathematical constructions rather than true graphic projections).

The Mercator projection used in ocean and coastal waters, and the polyconic projection used for inland lakes and rivers, have both been mentioned earlier in this chapter. These, plus the gnomonic projection used in polar regions, will now be presented in more detail. There are other systems of projection, but they have limited application and need not be considered here.

### Mercator Projection

The Mercator projection is often illustrated as a projection onto a cylinder. Actually, the chart is developed mathematically to allow for the known shape of the earth, which is not quite a true sphere. The meridians appear as straight, vertical lines; see Figure 15-32, upper. Here is our first example of distortion—the meridians no longer converge, but are now shown as being parallel to each other. This changes the representation of the shape of objects by stretching out their dimensions in an east-west direction.

Figure 15-32 A Mercator projection, above and below, can be visualized as the placement of a cylinder around the earth, parallel to the polar axis, and touching the earth at the equator. In actuality, the projection is accomplished mathematically. A Mercator chart shows considerable distortion in the near-polar latitudes.

To minimize the distortion of shape—one of the qualities that must be preserved as much as possible—there must be a stretching-out of dimensions in a north-south direction. The parallels of latitude appear as straight lines intersecting the meridians at right angles. Their spacing increases northward from the equator—see Figure 15-32, lower—in accordance with a mathematical formula that recognizes the slightly oblate shape of the earth. This increase in spacing is not obvious in the case of charts of relatively small areas, such as in the harbor and coastal series, but it is quite apparent in Mercator projections of the world.

The Mercator projection is said to be conformal, which means that directions can be determined correctly, and distances can be measured to the same scale in all directions. By the Mercator technique of distortion, then counterdistortion, the shape of areas in high latitudes is correctly shown, but their size appears greater than that of similar areas in lower latitudes. An island at 60° latitude (Alaska) would appear considerably larger than an island of the same size located at 25° latitude (Florida). Its shape, however, would still be true to its actual proportions.

##### CAUTIONS REGARDING USE OF CHARTS

Producing charts for the vast coastlines and contiguous waterways of the United States is a major undertaking. The U.S. Atlantic coast-line exceeds 24,500 nautical miles, the Gulf Coast 15,000 miles, the Pacific Coast 7,000 miles, and the Alaskan and Hawaiian shorelines total more than 30,000 nautical miles. NOS publishes almost 1,000 charts covering over 3.6 million square miles, and both of these figures increase each year. In meeting its global responsibilities, NGA puts out charts numbered in the thousands, and there are, in addition, many U.S. Army Corps of Engineers charts and navigational maps.

Keeping so many charts up-to-date is obviously a staggering task. Surveys are constantly being made in new areas and must be rechecked in old areas, but this work generally is dependent on the limitations of funding by taxpayers through the U.S. Congress. NOS has an extensive program of cooperative reporting by boaters to supplement its own information-gathering capability. Formal programs are established in the United States Power Squadrons and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, but all individual skippers are encouraged to report any corrections, additions, or comments to the chart’s issuing agency. Comments are also desired on other publications such as the Coast Pilots. Send comments to the Director, National Ocean Service, Silver Spring, MD 20910-3233.

Charting agencies make every effort to keep their products accurate and up-to-date with changing editions. Major disturbances of nature, such as hurricanes along the Atlantic Coast and earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest, cause sudden and extensive changes in hydrography and destroy aids to navigation. The everyday forces of wind and waves cause slower and less obvious changes in channels and shoals.

Be alert to the possibility of changes. Most charts will cite the authorities for the information presented and frequently the date of the information. Use additional caution when the surveys date back many years. Half of NOS charts are based on surveys made before 1940, many using lead lines. The surveys of some NGA charts go back more than a century.

Another possible problem lies in the horizontal datum used on the chart. Various datums have been used over the years; the standard now is the 1984 World Geodetic System (WGS 84). The 1983 North American Datum is essentially the same, but other datums may be found on charts from other regions or nations that will require adjustments to positions of charted features. This is primarily of concern to vessels using electronic navigation systems; see Chapter 16.

#### Advantages & Disadvantages

The great value of the Mercator chart is that straight-line meridians of longitude intersect straight-line parallels of latitude at right angles to form an easily used rectangular grid. Directions can be measured with reference to any meridian or parallel, or any compass rose. The geographic coordinates of a position can easily be measured from scales along the borders of the chart. You can draw a straight line on a Mercator chart between two points and run that course by determining the compass direction between them; the heading is the same all along the line. Such a line is called a rhumb line. However, a great circle, the shortest distance between two points on the earth’s surface, is a curved line on a Mercator chart; see Figure 15-35. This is difficult to calculate and plot. For passages of a few hundred miles or less, the added distance of a rhumb line is insignificant, so the rhumb is the track that is used.

The scale of a Mercator chart varies with the distance from the equator as a result of the N-S expansion. The change is unimportant on charts of small areas such as harbor charts, and the graphic scale may be used. The change in scale with latitude does become significant, however, in charts covering greater areas, as on general, coastal, and sailing charts. On such charts, when you measure distances using the latitude scale on either side margin, take care that distance is measured at a point on the latitude scale directly opposite the region of the chart being used. Never use the longitude scale at the top and bottom of the chart for measuring distance.

### Polyconic Projection

Another form of chart construction is the polyconic projection. This method is based on the development of the earth’s surface upon a series of cones, a different one being used for each parallel of latitude; see Figure 15-33. The vertex of the cone is at the point where a tangent to the earth at the specified latitude intersects the earth’s axis extended.

Figure 15-33 Polyconic projections are developed into a series of cones, each tangent to a different parallel of latitude. The sketch above shows two cones tangent at 20° and 30° north latitude. (For clarity, the projection of the earth’s surface onto the cones is not shown.) The polyconic projection of a large area, left, emphasizes the curved characteristics of the parallels and meridians of this type of chart. On charts of relatively small areas, this curvature exists but is very slight and not noticeable.

The polyconic projection yields little distortion in shape, and relative sizes are more correctly preserved than in the Mercator projection. The scale is correct along any parallel and along the central meridian of the projection. Along other meridians, the scale increases with increased difference in longitude from the central meridian.

Parallels appear as nonconcentric arcs of circles and meridians as curved lines converging toward the pole, concave toward the central meridian; refer to Figure 15-33, left. These characteristics contrast with the straight-line parallels and meridians of Mercator charts, and are the reasons why this projection is not so widely used in marine navigation. Directions from any point should be measured relative to the meridian passing through that point; in actual practice, the nearest compass rose is used. Great Lakes charts have a graphic plotting interpolator for close measurements of latitude and longitude.

A variation of this type is the Lambert conformal projection, which is based on one cone that intersects the earth’s surface at two parallels. It is used mostly by aviators because a straight line nearly approximates a great circle.

### Gnomonic Projection

A gnomonic chart results when the meridians and parallels of latitude are projected onto a plane surface tangent to the earth at one point; see Figure 15-34. Meridians appear as straight lines converging toward the nearer pole; the parallels of latitude, except for the equator, appear as curves.

Figure 15-34 A gnomonic projection is made by placing a plane surface tangent to the earth’s surface at a given location. Points on the earth’s surface are then projected onto the plane. A chart made on a gnomonic projection, left, shows meridians as straight lines converging toward the nearer pole. Parallels other than the equator appear as curved lines.

Distortion is great, but this projection is used in special cases because of its unique advantage—great circles appear as straight lines. Probably the easiest way to obtain a great circle track on a Mercator or polyconic chart is to draw it as a straight line on a gnomonic chart and then transfer points along the line to the other chart using the geographic coordinates for each point. The points so transferred are then connected with short rhumb lines, and the result will approximate, closely enough, the great circle path; see Figure 15-35.

Figure 15-35 A great circle provides the shortest distance between any two points on the earth’s surface and can be plotted as a straight line on a gnomonic chart, upper. To plot it on a Mercator chart, lower, the geographic coordinates at each meridian crossing are transferred and connected by a series of straight lines that appear to form a curve.

A special case of gnomonic chart projection occurs when a geographic pole is selected as the point of tangency. Now all meridians will appear as straight lines, and the parallels as concentric circles. The result is a chart easily used for polar regions where ordinary Mercator charts cannot be used.

### Pilot Charts

No discussion of nautical charts would be complete without a mention of the unique and valuable charts issued by the NGA. These pilot charts present in graphic form information on ocean currents and weather probabilities for each month, plus other data of interest to a navigator; see Figure 15-36. Articles of great navigational interest are printed on the reverse side of each chart. The five editions include Chart No. 16, North Atlantic Ocean, and Chart No. 55, North Pacific Ocean, and are available for download at http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&_page-Label=msi_portal_page_62&pubCode=0003.

Figure 15-36 A pilot chart, prepared for each month, is not intended to be used alone, but in conjunction with other navigational aids. Such a chart provides general information based on averages of many years on magnetic variation, great-circle routes, wave heights, gales, cyclones, temperature, ocean currents, prevailing winds, wind strengths, pressure, and visibility.

## ELECTRONIC CHARTS

The latest “high-tech” development in charting is the electronic chart—a full nautical chart presented on a viewing screen. Electronic charts were first suggested in the 1970s, but their implementation and development had to await faster processors and more economical large data storage capabilities. That time is now here, and electronic charts are suitable for ships of all types and sizes and small craft of nearly any size.

With the chart created electronically, it is possible to add information on the vessel’s position from GPS; objects detected by radar; heading, speed, and depth information; etc. The charts are digitized and stored magnetically on disks as used in personal computers or on plug-in cartridges; see Figure 15-37. In this chapter, we consider the charts themselves; we’ll discuss their use in navigation beginning in Chapter 16.

Figure 15-37 Electronic charts with image overlays can be displayed on a chartplotter, shown above, or on a personal computer using special charting software.

### Electronic Charting Terminology

There are many terms, with corresponding acronyms, and these can be confusing unless used specifically and correctly. Additional terms relating to display systems will be found in Chapter 16.

### Raster vs. Vector Charts

A first distinction must be made between the basic ways that the data of an electronic chart are generated.

A raster navigational chart (referred to as an RNC), which can also be called a “bitmapped chart,” is essentially a digital photograph of a conventional nautical chart. Raster data comprise an array of dots arranged in rows and columns. Each dot, or pixel, has a specific position in this array. Each pixel is assigned a color that, when viewed with other pixels in the array, produces an image.

RNCs are relatively easy and economical to produce. Each color plate that was used to print the paper chart is scanned at a high resolution that is later reduced to make the commercially distributed raster chart. When viewed, they appear just like the original paper chart with which all boaters are (or should be) familiar, although only a portion of the chart is viewable at a time. NOS maintains a master database of raster charts to which corrections are applied weekly; this is used to print new editions of paper charts and to provide information for updating print-on-demand charts. Since the technology is widely available and charts are not copyrighted, commercial activities that wish to do so can scan paper charts to produce raster charts.

A vector chart (an electronic navigational chart, ENC) consists of lines that are stored as digital data. These lines are defined by mathematical elements called vectors that contain the geometric qualities of each line. These lines can be as simple as a straight line connecting two points, or a long sinuous line defining a section of shoreline. They often take the form of geometrical shapes such as rectangles, circles, or triangles. Vector data can also contain point and area information; they frequently are composed of areas that are completely enclosed and can be filled with a single color. Vector data represent a database of chart features that can be used to intelligently process the information and draw the display. Initial versions of vector charts were intended for large-ship use and omitted coverage of some areas where such vessels do not travel. Recent NOS ENCs now contain everything that is on the paper/raster chart, with a few exceptions of some features on land that are not valuable to a navigator.

#### Advantages & Disadvantages of Each Type

The advantages of RNCs include their ease of production and the fact that, when viewed, they appear similar to the original chart. The disadvantage, however, is that it is difficult to link chart features to information in a database, as each pixel is a separate entity. Another negative factor is that the data file of an RNC is quite large, and the files expand exponentially as the resolution of the image is increased (the higher the resolution, the better the chart will look when viewed). RNCs are also scale dependent. When such a chart is zoomed out (to a smaller scale, larger area), pixels must be dropped; this degrades the image. When a view is zoomed in from the original image, pixels appear to be enlarged (actually they are repeated), often to a point where the image can no longer be recognized. This can have grave consequences when a raster chart is used for navigation. RNCs should be displayed and used at their base scale on a display that has sufficient resolution.

The advantage of ENCs is that each entity, such as each charted feature, can be linked to information about that entity in a database. ENCs are also usually considered to be scale independent—they retain their legibility as the user zooms out. Another desirable characteristic of a vector chart is that the data files are very compact and relatively small as compared to a raster chart. ENCs are composed of layers of information. One layer might consist of only shoreline features, another of just depth figures, another of aids to navigation, etc. Depending on the computer or chartplotter being used to view the chart, the navigator can display all layers simultaneously or only a limited number to reduce clutter; the appearance of each layer may differ from equivalent information shown on a paper chart or RNC. A disadvantage of vector charts is that they are much more difficult to produce—the chart is essentially completely redrawn by cartographers from existing chart database information plus other original source data; special care must be exercised that no errors are made. NOS produces ENCs to the standards of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), as do other nations, to ensure the interoperability of all such charts. Another disadvantage is that ENC systems may use symbols, abbreviations, and other characteristics that are different from conventional charts. The user, therefore, must become familiar with the differences before an ENC can be used with the same ease, speed, and accuracy as a conventional paper chart or an RNC.

The initial NOAA project to digitize charts was to produce only ENCs, but the work was tedious and exceedingly time consuming, requiring too great a number of cartographers. Work on the preparation of ENCs continues to meet the demand for such charts in electronic chart and display information systems (ECDIS) used on large ships. NOS has, however, all of its charts digitized as RNCs; these are used in the print-on-demand system, described on this page. ENCs are available for download from the NOS’s Office of Coast Survey (OCS) without charge at https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/charts/noaa-enc.html, but are not on any hard media. An online ENC viewer is available at that same URL; free viewers are available from other sources. ENCs and RNCs are available from commercial sources on such media as CD-ROMs and proprietary cartridges. NGA produces vector charts for naval and other governmental use, terming them digital navigation charts (DNC). DNCs for areas in which the U.S. is the prime charting authority are unclassified. All other areas have restricted distribution.

NOS keeps its files updated for both RNC and ENC charts as changes of all types—hydrographic, aids to navigation, hazards, etc.—occur. This includes all information included in Notices to Mariners and Local Notices to Mariners, plus other information not suitable for such publication. It is relatively simple to transmit ENC chart corrections to users either directly or via the Internet. Initially this was not possible for RNCs, giving vector charts a definite advantage in this respect. Now, however, computer techniques have advanced to a point where “patches” can be similarly sent to users for updating RNCs.

As ENCs become available for more and more maritime areas, they will replace RNCs and may become the standard for shipboard use. In 2019, NOAA started a five-year transition to end the production of RNCs and paper nautical charts.

### Accuracy & Precision Problems

The problems, described on this page, concerning the relative accuracy and scale of charts and electronic positioning systems apply equally to charts derived from paper charts, such as RNCs and any ENCs that were created by digitizing a paper chart.

## NAVIGATIONAL PUBLICATIONS

We think first of charts when we consider government publications designed to make boating safer, but we shouldn’t overlook the dozens of other publications that make piloting easier and more accurate. Generally, these are available from the same agencies that issue charts, as listed below. (See also Appendix A for additional information.)

### Publishing Agencies in the United States

In addition to various commercial organizations, agencies of the U.S. federal government that issue publications valuable to the boater include:

• Office of Coast Survey (OCS), part of National Ocean Service (NOS), a component of NOAA, Department of Commerce.

• U.S. Coast Guard, a component of the Department of Homeland Security.

• U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (District and Division Offices).

• National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), a major combat support agency of the Department of Defense.

• National Weather Service (NWS), also a component of NOAA.

• U.S. Government Printing Office.

• U.S. Naval Observatory.

The Government Printing Office, an independent agency, does, or contracts for, much of the actual printing of federal publications dealing with piloting. The Office of the Superintendent of Documents sells most of the publications, but there seems to be no clear rule about whether a publication is sold by the GPO or by the government agency that prepared it.

Publications sold by the GPO can be bought by mail from: Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. You can also buy them at a retail bookstore in the GPO building, North Capitol and H Streets in Washington, DC, and by mail or in person from GPO regional bookstores in many major cities. Make your checks payable to the “Superintendent of Documents,” or charge to your VISA or MasterCard account. The GPO Bookstore is online at http://bookstore.gpo.gov/.

### State Agencies

State agencies also produce a variety of publications of interest to boaters, but there are too many of them to list here. Some of these publications are listed in Appendix A, but you should also check with authorities in your own state and write ahead to other states when you expect to cruise in new waters. Be as specific as possible in requests for information and literature. Information may be obtained that will add to safety and convenience, possibly avoiding legal embarrassment as well. Remember, “Ignorance is no excuse” applies afloat as well as on shore.

### Sales Agents

Federal agencies have designated certain boating and book stores and marinas as sales agents for their products. Authorized sales agents of the National Ocean Service usually sell charts and publications from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, the Coast Guard, other federal and state agencies, and commercial publishers. It does not hold true that because a store sells items from one source, it will necessarily have available items from the others.

Two government websites—https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov and https://msi.nga.mil—will guide you to all the charts and publications you might need. Authorized sales agents for printed charts and publications can also be found on these websites. Despite all the GPS, chartplotter, and laptop chart information available almost instantaneously, it is still imperative to have paper charts on board, even if you just view them as an emergency backup in case the electronics should fail.

### Tide & Tidal Current Tables

The National Ocean Service is charged with the responsibility for the survey of the coast, harbors, and tidal estuaries of the United States and its insular possessions. NOS publishes charts, Chart Catalogs and Coast Pilots. NOS provides data to commercial publishers who now print Tide Tables and Tidal Current Tables in book format; these are usually available at local chart sales agents; see Figure 15-38.

Figure 15-38 Tide Tables and Tidal Current Tables, similar in format for either coast, provide predicted heights of tide for one and strengths and direction of current for the other, for virtually any location along the coasts. The printing and sale of these publications is now done commercially under contract from NOS, which supplies the data.

Tide Tables are of great value in determining the predicted height of the water at almost any place at any time. The tables are calculated in advance and are published annually in four volumes, one of which covers the East Coast of North and South America (including Greenland) and another the West Coast of these continents (including the Hawaiian Islands). The other volumes are for Central and Western Pacific Ocean (including the Indian Ocean), and for Europe and West Coast of Africa (including the Mediterranean Sea).

The Tide Tables give the predicted times and heights of high and low waters for each day of the year at a number of important points known as “reference stations.” Additional data show the difference in times and heights between these reference stations and thousands of other points, termed “subordinate stations.” The tables and their use in piloting are discussed at length in Chapter 17.

The Tidal Current Tables have much the same format of reference and subordinate stations as the Tide Tables. However, instead of indicating the times of high and low waters, these tables give the times and directions of maximum currents (ebb and flood), and the times of minimum currents. These times do not correspond to times of high and low tides, and the Tide Tables cannot be used for current predictions. Strength of the current is given in knots, and direction in degrees true.

Tidal Current Tables are published in two volumes: Atlantic Coast of North America and Pacific Coast of North America and Asia. Each volume includes tables for calculating current velocity at any intermediate time, and the duration of slack water or weak currents. Tidal Current Tables and their use in piloting are covered in detail in Chapter 17.

Although no longer publishing these tables in book format, NOS does make tide and tidal current predictions available on their website; https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov. The site provides access to a wealth of oceanographic information, including “Tides Online,” a complete station index, and predictions for the current year and for the preceding four years.

Tidal (and sometimes tidal current) data are often included on chart CD-ROMs used with navigational programs to be used on chartplotters and personal computers.

### Coast Pilots

Information on nautical charts is limited by space and by the system of symbols used. You will often need additional information for safe and convenient navigation. The National Ocean Service publishes such information in the Coast Pilot, covering the United States coastlines and the Great Lakes in ten separate volumes; see Figure 15-39.

Figure 15-39 Each Coast Pilot provides valuable information that cannot be shown on charts by symbols and abbreviations. They are available as printed books or on the Internet.

Each Coast Pilot contains channel descriptions, anchorages, bridge and overhead cable clearances, currents, prominent features, pilotage, towage, weather and ice conditions, wharf descriptions, dangers, routes and traffic separation schemes, small-craft facilities, and federal regulations applicable to navigation.

#### Atlantic Coast

No. 1 Eastport to Cape Cod

No. 2 Cape Cod to Sandy Hook

No. 3 Sandy Hook to Cape Henry

No. 4 Cape Henry to Key West

No. 5 Gulf of Mexico, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands

#### Great Lakes

No. 6 Lakes Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan and Superior, and St. Lawrence River

#### Pacific Coast

No. 7 California

No. 10 Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, and the Pacific Islands

#### Alaska

No. 8 Dixon Entrance to Cape Spencer

No. 9 Cape Spencer to Beaufort Sea

New Coast Pilots are published annually, and these supersede all prior issues. Each edition is corrected through the date of Notices to Mariners shown on the title page; do not use them without checking the Notices issued after publication. Changes that affect the safety of navigation and have been reported to NOS in the interim period between new editions are published in Notices to Mariners.

Online versions of the Coast Pilot volumes are available at https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/publications/coast-pilot/index.html; they are certified for navigation purposes. The digital files are those of the printed version and are updated weekly for changes published in Notices to Mariners. The complete Coast Pilot may be downloaded as a pdf file and includes a weekly record of updates since the previous published edition. Chapters and other major sections are also available as separate xml or pdf downloads. Coast Pilot updates are no longer included in the Coast Guard’s Local Notice to Mariners.

### Catalogs

The Office of Coast Survey used to publish seven free pdf Nautical Chart Catalogs for easy printing at home:

• Great Lakes

• Northeast

• Mid-Atlantic

• Gulf Coast and Caribbean Islands

• Hawaii and Pacific Islands

• Alaska

• Pacific Coast

These catalogs included small-scale outline charts with diagrams delineating the area covered by each NOS chart; see Figure 15-40. They are no longer published, but have been replaced by an online search tool, the Chart Locator, that can be accessed from https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov.

Figure 15-40 A catalog of nautical charts showing the area covered by each chart, the scale, and the price is no longer published, but equivalent information is available online (see text).

### NOAA Offices

For information about National Ocean Service charts, publications and activities, write, phone, fax or e-mail to:

Director, Office of Coast Survey

1315 East-West Highway

Silver Spring, MD 20910-3282

Phone: 1-888-990-6622

Fax: 1-301-713-4019

See https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov for access to NOAA’s 1,000 U.S. coastal and Great Lakes charts; each one has the latest Notice to Mariners corrections.

### U.S. Coast Guard Publications

The Coast Guard has publications about safe navigation covering such topics as aids to navigation, applicable rules and regulations, and general safety matters. Refer to Appendix A for a more complete listing. Some of these publications are available free; others are available for a nominal charge.

#### Light Lists

The United States Coast Guard produces a series of publications for the coastal and inland waters known as the Light List. These books provide more complete information concerning aids to navigation than can be shown on charts, but they should not be used for navigation in lieu of Coast Pilots and charts; see Figure 15-41.

Figure 15-41 Light Lists, published by the U.S. Coast Guard, provide more detailed information on all types of aids to navigation than can be shown conveniently on charts. These are also available with corrections on the Internet.

The Light Lists describe the lights (all classes), buoys, daybeacons, and racons maintained in all navigable waters of the U.S. by the Coast Guard and various private agencies. (In this usage, the Navy and all other non-USCG governmental bodies are considered “private agencies.”) The data shown in the Light Lists include a reference number, official name of the aid, its position (for many, but not all), light characteristics (if any), height, range, structure (as applicable), and remarks.

The Light Lists are published in seven volumes:

Volume I Atlantic Coast, from St. Croix River, Maine, to Shrewsbury River, New Jersey

Volume II Atlantic Coast, from Shrewsbury River, New Jersey, to Little River, South Carolina

Volume III Atlantic Coast, from Little River Inlet, South Carolina, to Econfina River, Florida (includes Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands)

Volume IV Gulf of Mexico, from Econfina River, Florida, to Rio Grande, Texas

Volume V Mississippi River System

Volume VI Pacific Coast and Pacific Islands

Volume VII Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River above the St. Regis River

Within each volume, aids to navigation are listed by Coast Guard Districts in the following order: seacoast, major channels, minor channels, and Intracoastal Waterway (if applicable). Lighted and unlighted aids appear together in their geographic order, with amplifying data on the same page.

Seacoast aids are listed in sequence from north to south along the Atlantic Coast, from south to north and east to west along the Gulf Coast, and from south to north along the Pacific Coast. Great Lakes aids are listed in a generally westerly direction. On the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, aids along the Intracoastal Waterway are listed in the same sequence. For rivers and estuaries, the aids to navigation are shown from seaward to the head of navigation. An aid serving a channel leading in from sea and the ICW is listed in both sequences.

All seven volumes of the Coast Guard Light List are available for purchase through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office; the volume for a particular area may be sold by authorized chart and publication sales agents within that area. Light Lists are published annually.

The Coast Guard Navigation Center (www.navcen.uscg.gov) offers pdf versions of each annual Light List for download, as well as Weekly Light List updates (without the front matter and index) from the Local Notice to Mariners in pdf or xml format. A Light List Summary of Corrections, which is a cumulative summary of the weekly updates since the last annual publication, is also available.

Light List data are also available from the NGA (https://msi.nga.mil/Publications/USCGLL). The aids to navigation data contained within the Light Lists can be queried and downloaded from an on-line database by searching within a Light List volume by specific aid (light) number, aid number range, or within a geographic area specified by latitude and longitude.

#### Navigation Rules

The Coast Guard has prepared an excellent booklet on the two sets of Rules of the Road. This is the Navigation Rules and Regulations Handbook; refer also to Chapters 4 and 5. This edition contains all changes for both sets of rules as of its publication date; all subsequent changes are published in Notices to Mariners and Local Notices to Mariners. This booklet presents the various Rules and Annexes on facing pages—International on the left, Inland on the right.

There are many illustrations of lights and shapes, each adjacent to the applicable rule. The demarcation lines separating U.S. Inland Rules waters from International Rules waters are described in detail. The booklet also describes penalties for violations of rules or regulations; it provides useful information on Vessel Traffic Service at many major ports and harbor entrances.

Copies of Navigation Rules and Regulations Handbook may be ordered from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office or regional or online GPO bookstores, or purchased from local sales agents for charts and nautical publications. An electronic copy can also be downloaded from www.navcen.uscg.gov.

The Coast Guard also makes available the Amalgamated International & U.S. Inland Navigation Rules at https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=NavRulesAmalgamated. The amalgamation includes the text common to the Inland and International Rules and explicitly identifies the differences between them, instead of merely printing the equivalent rules on facing pages as in the Handbook.

#### Other USCG Publications

A Boater’s Guide to the Federal Requirements for Recreational Boats and Safety Tips is a small pamphlet that will be very useful to all skippers. Topics include laws and regulations, numbering and documentation, reporting accidents, and approved equipment. This publication and others can be obtained by writing USCG Headquarters, Washington, DC 20593. Copies may also be available at Coast Guard district offices, some local USCG stations, and from various online sources.

### NGA Publications

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has several publications of interest to boaters. Charts, publications, and other products of NGA are identified with a prefix to the individual chart or publication number.

The nautical chart identification system uses a numeral of one to five digits, without prefix, as determined by the scale and assigned to regions and subregions.

Oceanographic products, primarily publications related to the dynamic nature of the oceans or the scientific aspects of oceanography, are printed by the Naval Oceanographic Office and carry numbers with prefixes that reflect the nature of the particular publication.

NGA is now producing most new publications in CD form only, and these are for military users only. For civilian users, the digital files are available for download at https://msi.nga.mil/Publications. These datasets can be more robust, expansive, and user-friendly than the current printed versions. Users can expect to have access to data links between publication datasets, video streams, links to other websites, timely up-to-date information, and current state-of-the-art graphics, photos, and commercial satellite imagery. Many publications are available in printed form from commercial publishers; some may have a CD available. NGA has no control over the distribution of these products, hardcopy or digital.

Users can also enroll in a Publication Updates subscription service to receive e-mail notifications of nautical publication updates and new editions.

#### Bowditch (Publication No. 9)

The American Practical Navigator (known as Bowditch), originally written by Nathaniel Bowditch in 1799, is an extensive treatise on piloting, celestial navigation, and other nautical matters. It is Publication No. 9 of NGA.

Bowditch has long been an accepted authority on piloting and other forms of navigation. The current 2002 edition is a single volume available in hardcover format with a digital version on CD included. It can also be viewed or downloaded at https://msi.nga.mil/Publications/APN. Keep the two volumes of the 1984 edition if you have them, as these contain some topics that have been dropped from the more recent editions.

#### Other NGA Publications

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publishes a series of Sailing Directions that provides supplementary information for foreign coasts and ports in a manner generally similar to the Coast Pilots for U.S. waters.

The Lists of Lights published by this agency likewise covers foreign waters and do not duplicate the Coast Guard Light Lists. These are NGA Pubs. Nos. 110 through 116.

Other NGA publications that may be useful to a boater include Pub. 117, Radio Navigational Aids, and Pub. 102, International Code of Signals.

NGA charts and publications are no longer listed in a printed NGA Catalog of Maps, Charts and Related Products, Part 2—Hydrographic Products, Volume I—Nautical Charts and Publications. This has been superseded by a digitalized version on CD; see Obtaining NGA Publications below on how this may be obtained, used, and updated.

NGA publications include a number of tables for the reduction of celestial observations. These are of interest only to those yacht skippers making extensive voyages on the high seas.

Other NGA publications are listed in Appendix A.

#### Obtaining NGA Publications

Charts and nautical publications from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency can often be purchased from the same sources as for NOS products (see this page). Commercial vendors of NGA products are listed at https://msi.nga.mil/Products.

The NGA, with the Defense Logistics-Intelligence Agency, has an online catalog for public use at https://msi.nga.mil/Products. The catalog contains a searchable record of charts and publications that are produced by NGA, NOS, and the USCG.

### Naval Observatory Publications

The Naval Observatory participates and assists in publishing the Nautical Almanac and the Air Almanac annually. There is also the annual Almanac for Computers, useful for programmable calculators and microcomputers; complete almanac and other data are now available on a single CD. These books contain astronomical data that is helpful for celestial navigation.

The Naval Observatory also participates in and assists the publication of other navigational documents such as the Tide Tables and celestial sight reduction tables, but it is not the agency directly responsible for them.

### U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Publications

The Corps of Engineers of the Unites States Army has the responsibility for navigational and informational publications on major inland (non-tidal) rivers such as the Tennessee, Ohio, and Mississippi, and many lakes and reservoirs behind large dams.

#### Intracoastal Waterway Booklets

The Army Corps of Engineers has prepared two paperbound booklets on the Intracoastal Waterway, which comes under its jurisdiction. These booklets contain descriptive material, photographs, small-scale charts and tabulated data.

Unfortunately, these publications are not periodically updated, and they are of far less value than the corresponding volumes of the NOS Coast Pilots with their annual editions and frequent changes in Notice to Mariners.

Bulletins on the Intracoastal Waterways are issued periodically by the Engineers District Offices. Addresses of these offices are given in the Appendix A.

#### Rivers & Lakes Information

Regulations relating to the use of many rivers and lakes (reservoirs), Navigational Bulletins and Notices to Navigation Interests are issued by various offices of the Corps of Engineers, as listed in Appendix A. Other government publications relating to inland river and lake boating are also listed on that page, together with information on their availability.

### National Weather Service Publications

The National Weather Service, a part of NOAA, prepares weather maps that appear in some newspapers, but boaters generally make greater use of radio and television broadcasts for weather and sea conditions.

To assist mariners and boaters in knowing when and where to listen for radio and TV weather broadcasts in or near the continental United States, NWS publishes a series of Marine Weather Services Charts.

Boaters who cruise far off U.S. shores and in foreign waters should use the NWS publication Worldwide Marine Weather Broadcasts, which contains information on frequencies and schedules of stations transmitting in radiotelephone, radiotelegraph and radioteletype modes.

### Keeping Publications Up to Date

You should be sure to keep charts and certain other navigational publications fully up to date. Outdated information can be more harmful than no information at all.

Coast Pilots and Light Lists are the primary publications that need continual correction. Fortunately, the government has provided a convenient means for executing this important function. The time and effort required are not great, provided a skipper keeps at it regularly and does not permit the work to build up a backlog.

#### U.S. Notice to Mariners

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency publishes a weekly U.S. Notice to Mariners that is prepared jointly with the National Ocean Service and the U.S. Coast Guard; see Figure 15-42, left. These pamphlets advise mariners worldwide of important matters that affect navigational safety, including new hydrographic discoveries, changes in channels and navigation aids, etc.; they contain information that is primarily of interest to ocean-going vessels. Besides keeping mariners informed generally, the Notice to Mariners gives information specifically useful for updating latest-edition nautical charts and publications. Each issue has instructions on how it is to be used to correct charts and other publications. Supplementary information is published in Notice No. 1 of each year; lists of recently affected charts are included in each issue.

Figure 15-42 Notice to Mariners is published in two versions: (1) a weekly edition, published by NGA, covers the entire world, except for inland waters not used by ocean shipping; (2) a local edition is published weekly by each U.S. Coast Guard district. Both of these are now available only on the Internet, but the contents and appearance are the same as the formerly printed versions.

Printed copies of the U.S. Notice to Mariners are no longer distributed to the public. The full contents are available online at https://msi.nga.mil/NTM. They are in a single pdf file or in a zipped file that includes both the complete Notice to Mariners in pdf format and high-quality graphics as JPG files; these may be either viewed online or downloaded. Notices are available as a whole or section by section. The contents and appearance are the same as the formerly mailed Notices. Back copies are available as far back as No. 29 of 1999. A free subscription service is available by which you will be notified by e-mail of the availability of each issue as it comes online. (Printed copies may be available from commercial sources.)

NGA also publishes a semiannual Summary of Corrections in regional volumes. Each issue contains the full text of all accumulated corrections from Notice to Mariners, except for Light Lists and certain other navigational publications. It is easier to use than a file of Notices for bringing up to date a chart that has not been kept corrected.

#### Local Notices to Mariners

The commander of each Coast Guard District issues weekly Local Notices to Mariners. These provide corrections for applicable charts, Light List, and Coast Pilot volumes; they also include current security regulations, general information of interest on bridges, local events, proposed changes to aids to navigation, etc.; see Figure 15-42, this page. Local Notices to Mariners bring information to users several weeks in advance of the U.S. Notices to Mariners prepared in Washington by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Local Notices are of particular interest to small-craft skippers, as the U.S. Notices do not carry information on inland waterways and other waters not used by large ocean-going vessels.

The USCG Local Notices to Mariners are no longer printed and mailed to subscribers. They are published weekly and are available in pdf format at http://www.navcen.uscg.gov. The opening page on this website provides a number of useful links to other advisories and notices. The on-line LNM page will also list and provide a link to Special Notices. There is a free “one-way e-mail service,” USCG LNM Subscription Service, that allows you to register and be automatically notified each time a new Local Notice is posted for the district or districts in which you are interested. This notification will also include information on the status of the online Light List volume for that district and other relevant marine information updates.

#### Changes to Coast Pilots & Light Lists

Changes for individual Coast Pilots and Light List volumes will be found online at the same Internet sites as the basic publications. The online changes provide the same information as Notices to Mariners and Local Notices to Mariners; they are easier to apply to the appropriate publication.

### Additional Navigation Information Available Online

The U.S. Coast Guard operates the USCG Navigation Information Service (NIS); this is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This can be reached by the Internet (www.navcen.uscg.gov) or telephone (703-313-5900). In addition to Local Notices to Mariners, up-to-the-minute status information on GPS is available.

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency operates the Maritime Safety Information website at https://msi.nga.mil. In addition to Notices to Mariners, this site has information on charts and publications issued by NGA and a complete catalog of NGA nautical products.

### Report All Useful Information

As emphasized earlier, all boaters are urged to help governmental agencies maintain the buoyage system by reporting damage to aids, malfunctioning of lights, shifting of shoals and channels, or new hazards. Use a radio if the matter is urgent; otherwise, reports of defects and suggestions for improvement of aids to navigation should be sent to the commander of the applicable Coast Guard district. You can also use the Coast Guard’s Boating Safety Mobile App, available for free download at https://uscgboating.org/mobile.

Similar information relative to NGA charts and publications can be submitted via the NGA website, https://msi.nga.mil, or sent to the Maritime Safety Office, MS N64 SFH, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, 7500 GEOINT Drive, Springfield, VA 22150.

Reports on the degradation or loss of radionavigation services can be made via the Internet at http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=gpsUserInput.

### Quasi-Governmental Publications

Besides the agencies and their publications noted above, several activities best described as “quasi-governmental” produce publications of interest to boaters. Two are discussed below.

#### RTCM

The Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services, better known as RTCM, includes representatives from governmental agencies such as FCC, Coast Guard, NOAA, and others; user organizations; equipment manufacturers; labor organizations; and communication companies. The RTCM does not have authority to make binding decisions, but it wields considerable influence as a meeting place for the resolution of conflicting views. Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services, 2200 Wilson Blvd Ste 102-109, Arlington, VA 22201, www.rtcm.org.

#### Naval Institute Publications

The United States Naval Institute is not a governmental agency; rather it is a private association dedicated to “the advancement of professional, literary and scientific knowledge in the Navy.” One of the institute’s principal activities is the publication of books dealing with naval and maritime matters.

The Naval Institute publishes a number of excellent books on the Navigation Rules, as well as the familiar text Dutton’s Nautical Navigation (formerly Dutton’s Navigation and Piloting). This volume has come to be recognized as an all-round authority on matters of piloting and navigation. The current volume is an outgrowth of years of development and expansion from an early work: Navigation and Nautical Astronomy by Benjamin Dutton. This useful book can be purchased in boating supply and book stores and is also available from Naval Institute Press, 291 Wood Road, Annapolis, MD 21402, or 800-233-8764, or www.usni.org/press/books.

#### Publications Available in Canada

Numerous Canadian Aids to Navigation are listed in USCG Light Lists Volumes I, VI, and VII. These are useful to mariners transiting U.S. waters adjacent to Canadian waters. The listing of some Canadian Aids to Navigation in the USCG Light Lists is not intended to be a substitute for the equivalent official Canadian publication, List of Lights.

##### COMMERCIALLY PUBLISHED CHARTS

Various commercial enterprises publish books of charts covering natural geographic regions of varying sizes. These charts are usually reproductions of portions of NOS or NGA charts, sized for convenient use on small craft. There may be additional information overprinted on the chart extracts and/or on separate pages in the front and back of the book. In some instances, the chart books are accompanied by a CD containing the same information; this gives the navigator the best of both worlds, paper charts and electronic charts to be viewed on a personal computer monitor.

Commercially printed charts may also come in the form of single pages printed on “waterproof” paper or plastic. These almost always contain overprinted information, usually relating to fishing or diving.

There are also many electronic charts published commercially in various formats for use with chartplotters; see this page.

Mandatory Carriage of Electronic Charts

The requirements for carrying electronic charts depend on the type and size of vessel. So far, recreational boats are required to carry navigation charts appropriate for the waters they will be traversing. The U.S. Coast Guard has not published recommendations for the mandatory carriage of electronic charts per se. The international SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) Convention includes a requirement for commercial ships to carry up-to-date charts and publications for the intended voyage; this requirement may be satisfied fully or in part by electronic means.

# CHAPTER16

Figure 16–01 Although this boat is equipped with electronic charts and navigation equipment, the prudent owner brings aboard paper charts and a selection of plotting tools.

BASIC PILOTING AND NAVIGATION TOOLS & PROCEDURES

The Dimensions & Tools of Piloting • Dead Reckoning • Precision & Accuracy, Rounding Numbers • Making a Speed Curve • GPS, Chartplotters, Radar, Depth Sounders, & Multi-function Displays

Piloting is the use of landmarks, aids to navigation, and soundings to conduct a vessel safely through channels and harbors, and along coasts where depths of water and dangers to navigation require constant attention to the boat’s position and course; see Figure 16-01.

Piloting is one of the principal subdivisions of navigation—the science and art of directing the movements of a vessel from one position to another in a safe and efficient manner. It is a science because it uses principles and procedures based on centuries of observation, analysis, and study; it is an art because interpretations of observations and other information require individual judgment and skill.

An adjunct to piloting is dead reckoning, a procedure by which a boat’s approximate location is determined at any time by its movements since the last accurate determination of position. The term is said to have evolved from deduced reckoning, often abbreviated “de’ed” reckoning in old ships’ logs.

Other types of navigation include celestial and electronic navigation. The latter is covered here and in Chapters 17 and 18, while celestial navigation is covered in more advanced texts such as Dutton’s Nautical Navigation or Bowditch.

## THE IMPORTANCE OF PILOTING

Piloting is used by boaters in rivers, bays, lakes, sounds, as well as close alongshore when on the open ocean or large lakes—all areas known as pilot waters. The navigator of a boat of any size in pilot waters must have adequate training and knowledge; he or she must be constantly alert and give his task close attention. Frequent determinations of position are usually essential, and course or speed changes may be necessary at relatively short intervals.

Always keep in mind that the use of “high-tech” electronic navigation instruments does not make basic piloting and chart work obsolete, as many GPS users seem to believe. Piloting and chartwork are integral to electronic navigation because, without a graphic representation of your pilot waters, you cannot know what lies ahead along your course. A GPS receiver will give you a very accurate and reliable readout of your boat’s position—i.e., its latitude and longitude coordinates—but without a chart, and without plotting your GPS position on it, you cannot know whether or not you are headed into danger.

Electronic chartplotters take GPS navigation a step further, using the GPS signal to show your boat’s position on a moving digital chart display. While this may relieve you of the routine necessity of chart-and-compass piloting, it does not relieve you of the responsibility for knowing how to do it. Traditional piloting techniques are not merely a hedge against the possible failure of your electronic navigation equipment, though this in itself is a sufficient reason to learn and practice piloting. The practice of piloting also places you in more intimate contact with your surroundings than electronic navigation can. Time spent studying paper charts, taking bearings on buoys and headlands, matching half-tide ledges you see across the water with their representations on the chart, and steering compass courses while searching the waters ahead makes you a more alert, more engaged, better, safer boater. Traditional piloting is also deeply satisfying, and you will retain a much more detailed and useful mental picture of waters you have piloted than of waters you transited with the aid of a chartplotter alone.

In this chapter we’ll look at piloting tools and methods first. Then we’ll explore how electronic navigation can make wayfinding more accurate and convenient.

#### The High Seas vs. Pilot Waters

On the high seas, or well offshore in such large bodies of water as the Great Lakes, your navigation can be more relaxed. An error or uncertainty of position of a few miles presents no immediate hazard to the safety of boat and crew. But when you approach pilot waters, you need greater precision and accuracy. An error of only a few yards, for example, can result in your running aground with possibly serious consequences. The presence of other vessels nearby underscores your constant need to know where the dangers lie and where your own boat can be steered safely if you need to maneuver to avoid a collision with another craft.

#### The Enjoyment of Piloting

You will enjoy piloting most when you can do it without anxiety, which means that you need a background of study and practice. Try “over-navigating” in times of fair weather so you acquire the skill needed to direct your boat safely through fog, rain, or night without fear or strain. Despite the availability and use of electronic systems, a good navigator will retain his or her basic skills, because piloting a boat with a chart and a pencil is a satisfying activity and a pleasure.

## THE DIMENSIONS OF PILOTING

The basic dimensions of piloting are direction, distance, and time. Other quantities that must be measured, calculated, or used include speed, position, and depths and heights. You must have a ready understanding of how each of these dimensions is measured, expressed in units, used in calculations, and plotted on charts.

### Direction

Direction is the position of one point relative to another without reference to the distance between them. As discussed in Chapters 13 and 15 on compasses and charts, modern navigation uses a system of angular measurement in which a complete circle is divided into 360 units called degrees. In some piloting procedures, degrees may be subdivided into minutes (there are 60 minutes in one degree) or into common or decimal fractions of a degree.

#### True, Magnetic, or Compass

Also as discussed, directions are frequently referenced to a base line running from the origin point toward the geographic North Pole. Such directions can be measured on a chart with reference to the meridians of longitude and are called true directions. Measurements made with respect to the direction of the earth’s magnetic field at that particular point are termed magnetic directions. Those referred to local magnetic conditions as measured by the vessel’s compass are designated compass directions; see Figure 16-02.

Figure 16-02 Direction, one of the basic dimensions of piloting, can be measured with respect to true, magnetic, or compass North. The reference used must always be designated when stating a direction.

To ensure accuracy, it is essential that you designate the direction reference when magnetic (M) or compass (C) is used; true is assumed when there is no letter designation.

#### Directions & Angles

The basic system of measurement uses the reference direction as 0° (North) and measures clockwise through 90° (East), 180° (South), and 270° (West) around to 360°, which is North again. Directions are expressed in three-digit form, such as 005°, 030°, 150°. Note that zeros are added before the direction figures to make a three-digit number, for example, 005° or 055°; see Figure 16-03, left. Angles that are not directions are expressed in one, two, or three digits as appropriate; 5°, 30°, 150°; see Figure 16-03, right. The use of three digits for directions helps distinguish them from angles.

Figure 16-03 Directions are always designated by a three-digit number. Add zeros before a single-digit or two-digit value (left). An angle between two directions (right), as distinguished from the directions themselves, is not expressed as a three-digit number.

Reciprocals For any given direction, there is its reciprocal direction: its direct opposite, differing by 180°. Thus the reciprocal of 030° is 210°, and the reciprocal of 300° is 120°. To find the reciprocal of any direction, simply add 180° if the given direction is less than that amount, or subtract 180° if it is more; see Figure 16-04.

Figure 16-04 The reciprocal of a given direction can be found by adding 180° to its value. If the total exceeds 360°, subtract 360°. Alternatively, subtract 180° from the original direction rather than doing this two-step addition and subtraction.

### Distance

Distance is defined as the spatial separation between two points without regard to the direction of one from the other. It is the length of the shortest line that can be drawn between the two points on the earth’s surface.

The basic unit of distance in piloting in the U.S. is the mile, but as noted in Chapter 15, a boater may encounter two types of miles. The familiar statute mile is used on many inland bodies of water, such as the Mississippi River and its tributaries, the Great Lakes, and the Atlantic and Gulf Intracoastal Waterways. It is 5,280 feet in length; the same mile as commonly used on land. On the high seas and connecting tidal waters, the unit of measurement is the nautical mile set at 6,076.1 feet. This “saltwater” mile was conceived as equal to one minute of latitude, and this relationship is often used in navigation on both the sea and in the air. The conversion between nautical and statute miles is a factor of 1.15; roughly, seven nautical miles equals eight statute miles.

You may cruise from an area using one kind of mile into waters where the other kind is used. Be sure to determine which type of mile is to be used in your calculations. For shorter distances, a few miles or less, the unit of measurement may be the yard; feet are seldom used except for depths and heights.

Should the metric system be adopted in the United States, boaters must be prepared for greater use of meters (m) and kilometers (km); they must be familiar with these units and conversion to and from conventional units. Factors are: 1 foot = 0.3048 meter; 1 yard = 0.9144 meter; 1 statute mile = 1.609 kilometers, 1 nautical mile = 1.852 kilometers exactly. See Appendix D for additional conversion factors. Even though many charts will use mostly metric measurements, distances will probably continue to be stated in nautical miles because of its relationship to latitude.

### Time

Although a navigator in pilot waters does not need so accurate a knowledge of the exact time of day as does a celestial navigator, ability to determine the passage of time and to perform calculations with such elapsed time is essential.

#### Units of Time

The units of time used in boating are the everyday ones of hours and minutes. In piloting, measurements are seldom carried to the precision of seconds of time, although decimal fractions of minutes may occur occasionally in calculations. Seconds and fractions of minutes may be used in competitive events such as races and predicted log contests, but seldom otherwise.

#### The 24-Hour Clock System

In navigation, including piloting, the time of day is expressed in a 24-hour system that eliminates the designations of a.m. and p.m. Time is written in four-digit figures; the first two are the hour and the last two are the minutes. The day starts at 0000 or midnight; the next minute is 0001, 12:01 a.m. in the “shore” system; 0100 would be 1 a.m., and so on to 1200 noon. The second half of the day continues in the same pattern, with 1300 being 1 p.m., 1832 being 6:32 p.m., etc., to 2400 for midnight. (The time 2400 for one day is the same as 0000 for the next day.)

Time is spoken as “zero seven hundred” or “fifteen forty.” The word “hours” is not used. The times of 1000 and 2000 are correctly spoken as “ten hundred” and “twenty hundred,” not as “one thousand” or “two thousand.”

When performing arithmetic computations with time, remember that when “borrowing” or “carrying” there are 60 minutes in an hour, and not 100. As obvious and simple a matter as this may be, miscalculations occur all too often.

#### Times Zones

A navigator in pilot waters must also be alert to time zones. Even in coastal or inland waters, you can cruise from one zone to another, necessitating the resetting of clocks and watches.

#### Daylight Time

A further complication in time is the prevalence of daylight time during the summer months. Government publications may use standard time; local sources of information such as newspapers and radio broadcasts use daylight time if it is in effect. Daylight time is one hour later than standard time. When converting from standard time to daylight, add one hour; from daylight to standard, subtract one hour.

### Speed

No matter what type of boat you have, speed is an essential dimension of piloting. Speed is defined as the number of units of distance traveled in a specified unit of time. The basic unit of speed is miles per hour, whether these are nautical or statute miles, as determined by location. A nautical mile per hour is termed a knot. Since this term includes “per hour,” it is incorrect to say “knots per hour.” The unit “knot” may be abbreviated either as “kn” or “kt”; the former has a somewhat greater usage.

#### Conversion of Knots & mph

The conversion factors between statute miles per hour (mph) and knots are the same as for the corresponding units of distance—1 knot = 1.15 mph, or 7 knots roughly equals 8 mph. (1 knot = 1.852 km/h).

### Position

The ability to describe the position of his vessel accurately is an essential requirement for a boater, and one that marks him or her as well qualified. To realize the importance and the difficulties of this seemingly simple task, listen to your radio on VHF Channel 16 or 22A on a weekend afternoon during the boating season. The hesitant, and inaccurate, attempts by skippers to simply say where they are surely must irritate the Coast Guard and embarrass competent boaters, and almost always delays the arrival of assistance. The availability of GPS receivers with their direct and highly accurate display of position has alleviated but not eliminated this problem.

#### Relative & Geographic Coordinates

Position may be described in two ways: in relative terms or by geographic coordinates. To state your boat’s relative position, describe it as being a certain distance and direction from an identifiable point such as a landmark or aid to navigation. Precision depends on the accuracy of the data on which you base the position: you might say that you were “about two miles southeast of Point Judith Light”; or if you had the capability of being precise, you could say, “I’m 1.8 miles, 130° true from Point Judith Light”; see Figure 16-05. Be careful not to confuse the direction you measure toward the identifiable point with your report of position from the object. In relative positioning, the distance can, of course, be essentially zero, as would be the case with a position report such as “I am at Bell Buoy 4.”

Figure 16-05 A boat’s position may be described in “relative” terms, such as distance and direction from an identifiable object, for example, a landmark or aid to navigation. The position shown here might be stated as “1.8 miles, 130° true, from Point Judith Light.”

These examples of position description have all used visible identifiable objects. You can also state your geographic position in terms of latitude and longitude using those straight, uniformly spaced lines on most charts. Using this procedure, measure the position from the markings on either side and on the top or bottom of your chart.

The units of measurement for geographic coordinates are degrees and minutes, but this degree is not the same unit as used in the measurement of direction, nor is this minute the same as the unit of time. Be careful not to confuse these units of position with other units with similar names. For more precise position definition, you can use either seconds or decimal fractions of minutes (usually tenths), as determined by your chart. The smallest unit on the marginal scales of NOS coast charts is tenths of minutes, but for harbor charts it is seconds; refer to Chapter 15, Figures 15-12 and 15-13.

To state your boat’s geographic position, give the latitude first, before longitude, and follow the figures by “north” or “south” as appropriate. Similarly, longitude must be designated “east” or “west” to be complete. All U.S. waters are in north latitude and west longitude, but the position labels should be stated nevertheless; see Figure 16-06.

Figure 16-06 A boat’s position may also be described in geographic coordinates. Using the subdivisions on the chart’s borders, latitude and longitude are measured as shown here and are recorded with time: 41°11.7′N, 071°27.8′W at 0700.

Skippers of boats with GPS normally describe their position in terms of latitude and longitude.

### Depths

The depth of the water is important both for safety of a boat in preventing grounding, and for navigational purposes. Thus, this vertical measurement from the surface of the water to the bottom is an essential dimension of piloting. Measurements may be made continuously or only occasionally as appropriate.

In pilot waters, depths are normally measured in feet; refer to Figure 16-05. In open ocean waters the small-boat operator may use charts indicating depths in fathoms of six feet each. Some charts of other nations may use meters and decimeters (tenths of a meter). Check each chart when you buy it, and again when you use it, to note its unit of depth measurement. Check also the datum—the horizontal plane of reference, such as mean lower low water—from which depths on the chart are measured; refer to Chapter 15, Figure 15-09. Note that “mean lower low water” is the average of the lower low water of each tidal day, and there will be many days that will have a low water level below the mean; at those times, actual depths will be less than the figures printed on the chart. Charts of inland waters will have a datum at a specified level.

In many areas, depths often fluctuate from the chart’s printed figures because of tidal changes; in other areas, depths change in seasonal patterns.

### Heights

The height or elevation of objects is also of concern to a boater. The height of some landmarks and lighted aids to navigation may determine their range of visibility. Of more critical importance, however, are such vertical measurements as the clearance under a bridge; refer to Chapter 17, Figure 17-02. Heights, or vertical dimensions upward from the surface of the water, are measured in feet (or meters).

You will find that in tidal areas the plane of reference for heights is not the same as for depths.

The usual datum for height measurement is mean high water. This will be an imaginary plane surface above the mean low-water datum for depths by an amount equal to the mean tide range; charts usually show the height at mean high water; refer to Chapter 15, Figure 15-17.

Note that “mean high water” is the average of all highs, and there will be many instances of normal highs being above the datum, with correspondingly lesser vertical clearances.

## THE INSTRUMENTS OF PILOTING

For piloting in coastal and inland waters, you will need a few simple tools or instruments. They are not particularly expensive items, but they should be of good quality, well cared for, and used with respect. Most navigators augment these time-honored tools with one or more electronic navigation instruments, beginning with a handheld or fixed-mount GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver, as covered later in this chapter.

### Direction

Many instruments are used for measuring direction—some directly and others on a chart. Still other instruments measure direction both from a chart and from observation.

#### Determining Direction

The basic instrument for determining direction is a compass. With rare exceptions it will be a magnetic compass, as described in Chapter 13. Its directions are properly called “compass” directions—not “magnetic,” not “true.” Usually, before a direction such as 057°C can be used or plotted, it must be corrected for both deviation and variation (see Chapter 13, this page).

The compass is used primarily to determine the direction in which the boat is headed. Depending upon its mounting and its location in the boat, you may also be able to use the steering compass to determine the direction of other objects from your boat. Readings may be taken by sighting across the compass itself and estimating the reading of the compass card. Steering compass sights are generally accurate enough, but physical obstructions usually limit them to objects forward of the beam.

Hand-bearing Compass You can take compass sights more flexibly with a hand-bearing compass, which is held in the hand and not in a stationary mounting. These come in many styles, but each is basically a small liquid-filled compass with a suitable grip for holding in front of your eye, plus a set of sights and/or a prismatic optical system for simultaneously observing a distant object through the sights and reading the compass card. A typical hand-bearing compass is shown in Figure 16-07; this model uses a prism in lieu of sights; see also Figure 16-21. A small steering compass can sometimes be removed from its mounting (but only if the construction is such that the compensating magnets are part of the mounting and do not come with the compass when it is removed) and taken to where there is an unobstructed line of sight to a distant object. Some binoculars have a built-in compass that allows the user to simultaneously see the distant object more clearly and read its direction.

Figure 16-07 A hand-bearing compass can be used from almost any location on a boat, but be careful to keep away from large masses of magnetic material that could cause deviation errors.

A hand-bearing compass is normally used on deck, away from the usual causes of magnetic deviation, as discussed in Chapter 13, this page. Take care, however, not to get too close to objects of iron or similar material, such as anchors or stays and shrouds. To find a sighting position on deck that you can be sure is free of magnetic influences, take bearings on a distant charted landmark with your boat in a known position. Compare your hand-bearing readings taken from various locations on deck with the magnetic bearing from the chart. Put the boat on several different headings as you do this, in case the orientation of its magnetic influences has an important effect on the hand-bearing compass. When taking the bearing make sure your eyeglasses or such other items as a spare battery in your shirt pocket are not causing deviation.

Typically, you would find a clear space to stand and brace yourself (note that you will be concentrating on the sighting and not keeping a weather eye for the next large wave), then raise the hand-bearing compass to your eye and take the reading.

Hand-bearing compasses are also very useful in determining whether a nearby vessel is changing position with respect to your boat. Are you on a collision course? Are you winning or losing ground in a race? A hand-bearing compass can help you answer these important questions—though not always definitively—while there is still time to do something about it.

#### Plotting Directions

Once you have determined a direction by compass, pelorus, or other device, you must plot it on the chart. There are several instruments for doing this, and they are the same tools used for determining direction from the chart itself.

Course Plotters These are pieces of clear plastic, usually rectangular, which have one or more semicircular scales for reading angles; see Figure 16-08. The center of the scales is at or near the center of one of the two long edges of the plotter and is usually emphasized with a small circle or bull’s-eye. Plotters have two main scales on an outer arc, one from 000° to 180° and the other from 180° to 360°, each calibrated in degrees. There may also be two auxiliary scales on an inner arc; these are offset 90° from the main scales. Lines are marked on the plotter parallel to the long edges.

Figure 16-08 A course plotter is a single piece of transparent plastic ruled with a set of lines parallel to the long edges, and semicircular main and auxiliary scales in degrees.

Course plotters are used in the following manner:

To determine the direction of a course or bearing from a given point: Place the plotter on the chart so that one of its long edges is along your course or bearing line, then slide the plotter until the bull’s-eye is over a meridian (longitude lines running North-South). Read the true direction of your plotted course or bearing where the appropriate main scale is intersected by the meridian. Easterly courses are read from one main scale and westerly courses from the other; see Figure 16-09. If it is more convenient, find your plotted course or bearing with reference to one of the plotter’s marked parallel lines rather than its edge. It is not essential that you actually draw your course or bearing line (the plotter can be aligned using only the two points concerned), but it is often easier and safer to do so.

Figure 16-09 The course plotter is lined up with the charted line along one of the longer sides and is then moved until a meridian cuts through the bull’s-eye. Direction can then be read from the appropriate main scale. If more convenient, the plotted line can be lined up with one of the parallel lines on the course plotter.

When the direction to be measured is within 20° or so of true North or South, it may be difficult to reach a meridian by sliding the course plotter across the chart. The small inner auxiliary scales are included on the plotter for just such cases. Slide the plotter until the bull’s-eye intersects a parallel of latitude (east-west line). The intersection of this line with the appropriate auxiliary scale indicates the direction of the course or bearing; see Figure 16-10.

Figure 16-10 In the case of plotted lines within 10° to 20° of North or South, the inner auxiliary scale and a parallel of latitude can be used.

To plot a specified direction (course or bearing) from a given point: Put a pencil point on the origin location. Keeping one of the long edges of the course plotter snug against the pencil, slide the plotter around until the center bull’s-eye and the specified angle on the appropriate main scale both lie along the same meridian. With the plotter thus positioned, draw in the specified direction from the origin point.

Alternatively, you can first position the plotter using the bull’s-eye and scale markings without regard to the origin point, then slide the plotter up or down the meridian until one of the long edges is over the origin point.

For directions nearly north or south, use one of the small auxiliary scales on a parallel of latitude.

To extend a line that must be longer than the length of the course plotter: Place both points of a pair of dividers (see this page), opened to three or four inches (7–10 cm), tightly against the edge of the plotter and then slide the plotter along using the divider points as guides. Draw in the extension of the course or bearing line after the plotter has been advanced.

To draw a new line parallel to an existing course or bearing line: Use the parallel lines marked on the course plotter as guides.

Some course plotter models do more than just measure directions. One, called a nautical ruler, has distance scales along its long edges for both nautical and statute miles at common chart scales.

Course plotter directions are measured from lines of longitude or latitude and are therefore in degrees true. Observed compass courses and bearings must be corrected to true degrees before being plotted; plotted courses and bearings must be “uncorrected” to compass degrees before being steered or sighted.

There are other plotting instruments, such as the Quik-Course; see Figure 16-11. This can be used to determine the direction of a course line by placing its center at any point along the line, orienting the horizontal and vertical lines with similar lines on the chart, and reading the true direction from the printed scales. After correction from compass to true, bearings can be plotted by placing the center of the Quik-Course on the object sighted upon, aligning the plotter, and placing a pencil mark on the chart for the reciprocal of the bearing as read on the scale around the outer edge of the plotter. After you remove the Quik-Course from the chart, you can draw a line from this pencil mark back to the location of the sighted object.

Figure 16-11 A specialized plotting tool, such as a Quik-Course plotter, is handy to use in plotting course lines and bearing. It is particularly useful in smaller, open boats.

Course Protractors These instruments, with their moving parts, are slightly more complex than course plotters but can plot courses and bearings in degrees true or magnetic, according to preference; see Figure 16-12. They typically consist of a small clear plastic square marked with a 360° compass scale and a grid of fine lines. Riveted on the center of the circular scale is a clear plastic arm that revolves like the hands of a clock—but it is a very long arm, extending about a foot (30.5 cm) beyond the circle of the compass scale. The principle is to align the protractor with the chart’s nearest printed compass rose.

Figure 16-12 Some navigators prefer to use a course protractor for plotting. The long arm is movable with respect to the square grid.

Course protractors are used in the following manner:

To measure the direction of a course or bearing: Place the center of the course protractor on the chart exactly over the specified origin point, such as your boat’s position or an aid to navigation. Then swing the protractor’s arm around to the nearest compass rose on the chart, making the upper edge of the arm (which is in line with the center of the course protractor) pass directly over the center of the compass rose.

Holding the protractor arm firmly in this position, rotate the compass part of the protractor until the arm’s upper edge cuts across the same degree marking of the protractor compass as it does at the compass rose (true or magnetic). The protractor now replicates the compass rose. If you orient the protractor to the rose’s inner scale, you are working in degrees magnetic and will not have to convert all courses and bearings to and from degrees true, though you will still have to correct and uncorrect for compass deviation.

Holding the protractor compass firmly against the chart, move the protractor arm around until its edge cuts across the second point of your course or bearing. You can now read the direction in degrees (true or magnetic) directly from the protractor compass scale.

To plot a course or bearing from a given point: Orient the protractor rose to the chart’s compass rose as in the preceding instructions. Then rotate the arm until the desired direction is indicated on the compass scale, and draw in the line; extend the line back to the origin point after you have labeled the course and the protractor has been lifted off the chart.

Parallel Rulers These are traditional instruments for measurement and plotting directions on charts. Parallel rulers may be made of black or clear transparent plastic; see Figure 16-13. The two rulers are connected by linkages that keep their edges parallel and, like ordinary drawing rulers, have beveled edges that are convenient for drawing lines. To measure the direction of a line, line up one ruler with the desired objects on the chart and then “walk” the pair across the chart to the nearest compass rose by alternately holding one ruler and moving the other toward the compass rose or other objective using the two small knobs that are on each ruler. One ruler is held firmly in place on the chart while the other is advanced. Then this second ruler is held in place while the first is closed up on it; this process can be repeated as necessary. To plot a line of stated direction, reverse the process; start at the compass rose and walk to the desired origin point and draw a line to the length desired. In both procedures, take care that the rulers do not slip.

Figure 16-13 Parallel rulers are a traditional plotting instrument. Two straightedges are kept in parallel alignment by the connecting links. Transfer directions from one location to another by “walking” the rulers from plotted line to a compass rose, or vice versa.

Normally the outer circle of a compass rose will be used, giving true directions. With experience, however, the inner circle can be used for measurement of magnetic directions; remember that deviation must be applied to get compass directions.

Drawing Triangles An ordinary plastic pair of these can also be used for transferring a direction from one part of a chart to another, although not for very great distances. The two triangles need not be similar in size or shape; it is helpful if each triangle has a handle. Place the two hypotenuses (longest sides) together and line up one of the other sides of one triangle with the course or bearing line, or with the desired direction at the compass rose; see Figure 16-14. Hold the other triangle firmly in place as a base, and slide the first one along its edge carrying the specified line to a new position while maintaining its direction. If necessary, alternately slide and hold the triangles for moving greater distances. Although it takes some practice to use this method, it does work.

Figure 16-14 A pair of ordinary drawing triangles can be used for easily transferring a direction from one part of a chart to another, but not for long distances.

Other Instruments There are a number of other instruments available for use in plotting directions, including patented variations on those mentioned above. You may use any that you feel comfortable with.

There are also several more comprehensive plotting systems available. These may consist of a means for mounting and protecting a chart and may provide a set of several specialized plotting devices that can make chartwork much easier to execute and much more accurate in practice. While the principles are the same (and still must be thoroughly understood), such chartwork systems are especially desirable for small-boat skippers. An electronic chart table, such as the Yeoman shown in Figure 16-15, provides a very convenient way to precisely plot position information from a connected GPS receiver and to measure bearings and distances on both printed and hand drawn charts.

Figure 16-15 Various electronic plotting systems are available that can simplify and speed up many procedures. Some, such as the Yeoman shown here, compute positions electronically once matched to the chart and can accept input from other instruments.

### Distance

Distance to an object can be measured by radar, and distance traveled can be measured directly by a summing log or on a GPS receiver.

Alternatively, a handheld optical range-finder can be used to measure distance to an object up to a thousand yards or so. Most often in piloting, however, distances are measured by taking them from a chart.

#### Chart Measurements for Distance

Dividers Distance is measured on a chart with a pair of these; see Figure 16-16. Open the two arms of the dividers, and the friction at the pivot is sufficient to hold the separation between the points. Most dividers have some means for adjusting this friction; it should be enough to hold the arms in place, but not so much as to make opening or closing difficult. A special type of dividers has a center crosspiece (like the horizontal part of the capital letter “A”) which can be rotated by a knurled knob to set and maintain the opening between the arms; thus the distance between the points cannot accidentally change; see Figure 16-16, center. This type of dividers is particularly useful if kept set to some standard distance, such as one mile at the scale of the chart being used.

Figure 16-16 Three styles of dividers are shown here. When using the more common kind (left), the friction at the pivot holds the arms for the desired opening between the points. Another type (center) uses an adjustable center cross arm to maintain the separation between the points. When using traditional “one-hand” dividers (right), squeeze the lower part of the arms to close the gap, the upper part to open it.

To measure distance with dividers: First open them to the distance between the two points on the chart, then transfer them without change to the chart’s graphic scale. Although your first thought might be to place one divider pin on the zero position of the scale and then see where the other pin falls to read a distance, there is a more accurate procedure. For one pin of the dividers, choose a mark on the scale for a whole number of units so that the other pin falls on the subdivided unit to the left of zero; refer to Chapter 15, Figure 15-07. The distance measured is the sum of the whole units to the right of the zero mark and the fraction of a unit measured to the left of zero. Be sure to note the type of fraction used, such as seconds of latitude/longitude, tenths of a mile, or hundreds of yards/meters.

If the distance on the chart cannot be spanned with the dividers opened widely (about 60 degrees is the maximum practical opening), follow this procedure: set the points for a convenient opening for a whole number of units on the graphic scale or latitude subdivisions; then step this off the necessary number of times by swinging one leg past the other as you set the points alternately along the line. Although you have probably drawn in a line on the chart, it is possible to step the dividers along the edge of a ruler; remember to count the number of steps. Then adjust the dividers to measure the odd remainder. The total distance is then the simple sum of the parts stepped off and measured separately; see Figure 16-17.

Figure 16-17 When a chart distance is too great to be measured with a single setting of the dividers, open the points to a whole number of units. Step these along the charted line for the required number of times, and then measure any smaller distance left over in the usual manner.

To mark off a desired distance on the chart: Set the right pin of the dividers on the nearest lower whole number of units, and the left pin on the remaining fractional part of a unit measured leftward from zero on the scale. The dividers are now properly set for the specified distance at the scale of the chart being used and can be applied to the chart. If the distance is too great for one setting of dividers, step it off in increments.

Charts at a scale smaller than 1:80,000 do not have a graphic scale; distances are measured on the latitude scales at either side of the chart. Take care to measure on these scales near the same latitude as the portion of the chart being used; in other words, move directly horizontally across the chart to either of its sides to use the scales; refer to Figure 16-17.

With a little experience you can set and use conventional dividers with one hand. Making sure that the friction at the pivot is properly adjusted, practice this technique until it is easy for you; it will add convenience and speed to your piloting work. Traditional “one-hand” dividers have a pair of curved arms; squeezing them above or below the crossover opens or closes the gap between the points; refer to Figure 16-16, right.

An instrument that looks much like a pair of dividers, except that a pencil lead or pen is substituted for one point, is called a compass (or drawing compass to distinguish it from a magnetic compass). This is used primarily for drawing circles or arcs of circles.

Chart Measurer This device can also be used to measure distance across a chart, although with reduced, but generally acceptable, accuracy. A chart measurer has a small wheel that rolls along the chart and is internally geared to an indicating dial. Chart measurers read distances directly in miles at various typical chart scales; there are separate models for charts using statute and nautical miles. They are particularly useful in measuring distances up and down rivers with many bends and changes of direction.

### Time

Every skipper, no matter how small his or her boat, should have a dependable and reasonably accurate timepiece, whether a clock, wristwatch, or pocket watch. Long-term accuracy is of secondary importance in piloting, but short-term errors, those accumulated over the length of a day or half-day, should be small. A knowledge of the time of day within a few minutes is usually all you will need. If you use a clock, mount it where it is clearly visible from the helm-seat or plotting table.

Elapsed time is often of greater interest than absolute time; a stopwatch is handy for this; see Figure 16-18. Most stopwatches have a second hand that makes one revolution per minute, and this is the simplest kind to use, but there are some that sweep completely around in 30 seconds and even a few that have a 10-second period; some have a digital readout. Know for sure the type of stopwatch you are using.

Figure 16-18 A stopwatch, as shown here, or a wristwatch that includes a timing function, is useful for measuring elapsed times. It eliminates the possibility of mistakes that might be made in subtracting clock times.

Also quite useful is a countdown timer with alarm. This can be either a simple kitchen timer from the galley, or a wristwatch with the countdown feature. Countdown timers save you the trouble of keeping an eye on the clock to be ready for a course change or an expected sighting of an aid to navigation.

Digital wristwatches are excellent for use in piloting. Some models have many features in addition to ordinary timekeeping, such as settable alarm, stopwatch, and countdown timer with alarm.

### Speed

Speed is a dimension that can either be measured directly or calculated from knowledge of distance and time. Direct-reading instruments are convenient, but they give only the speed through the water, not the speed made good over the bottom.

In “olden days,” the speed of a vessel through the water was measured by a “chip log.” A weighted wooden float was attached to the end of a line that was allowed to run out off a reel. Knots were tied in this line at regular, specific intervals (47 feet, 3 inches) and counted as the line ran out for a specified time, measured by turning an hourglass (actually a 28-second glass). The number of knots that had passed gave the vessel’s speed in nautical miles per hour. Hence the speed was measured in—what else—“knots,” and it still is today!

More modern marine speedometers use the pressure built up in a small tube by motion of the boat, or the rotation of an impeller. There are many different models with varying speed ranges, from those for sailboats to models reading high enough for fast powerboats; see Figure 16-19.

Figure 16-19 This cockpit- or wheelhouse-mounted digital display unit receives an electronic signal from a small impeller mounted through the bottom of the boat, and can display distance run as well as speed through the water.

Speed made good (SMG), also termed speed over ground (SOG), can be manually calculated from distance covered and elapsed time, as discussed later in this chapter, or with special calculating devices. These calculators are adaptations of general mathematical slide rules; they may be either linear or circular in form; see Figure 16-20.

Figure 16-20 A circular calculator or slide rule, such as the one seen here, enables a navigator to solve speed-distance-time problems as well as other conversions or measurements. It provides easily read, accurate results.

Small electronic calculators are also very useful for speed-time-distance computations. Today’s GPS receivers provide quite accurate SOG data. This is especially true when differential corrections are being used.

### Depth-Measuring Tools

Water depths can be measured manually or electronically. A hand lead line is simple, accurate, and not subject to breakdowns, but it is awkward to use, inconvenient in bad weather, can give only one or two readings per minute, and can be used only at quite slow speeds or to check depths around an anchored boat or one that has gone aground. When it is useful, however, it is very useful. If you run aground, its readings can tell you the best direction to go to get off; it’s not always dead astern. The line need not be long, 10 feet or so with markings every foot, plus a special mark at your boat’s draft. A handheld lead line can also be helpful when used from a dinghy ahead of your boat if you are outside a channel in unknown depths. A marked boathook or other pole can be used in shallower waters.

Many small boats today have an electronic depth sounder—a convenient device that gives clear and accurate measurements of the depth of water beneath the boat. A depth sounder gives readings many times each second, so frequently that they appear to be a smooth, continuous depth measurement. There is more information on these relatively inexpensive piloting aids later in this chapter.

### Miscellaneous Piloting Tools

Among the most important of all piloting tools are ordinary pencils and erasers; see Figure 16-21. Pencils should be neither too hard nor too soft. If too hard they tend to score into the chart paper, and if too soft they smudge. A medium (HB or No. 2) pencil works well; experiment to see what hardness is best for you. Keep several pencils available, well sharpened, and handy to the plotting table. Fine lead (0.5mm) mechanical pencils are excellent.

Figure 16-21 Seen here are some of the basic tools for piloting: a high-quality, waterproof binocular, hand bearing compass, powerful searchlight, flashlight with magnifying lens, and, most important, pencil and eraser.

A soft eraser of the “Pink Pearl” type is good for most erasures; an art gum eraser works well for general chart cleaning.

Binocular A good binocular is essential for most piloting situations. In choosing a binocular, remember that higher powers give greater magnification, bringing distant objects closer, but only at the cost of a more limited field of view. An adequate field of view makes it easier to find an object on small boats with their rapid and sometimes violent motion—just the time when you are most anxious to find that object.

A binocular is designated by two numbers, such as 6 x 30 or 10 x 50. The first figure indicates the power of magnification, the second is the diameter of the front lens in millimeters—a 6 x 30 binocular enlarges images 6 times and has a 30 mm front lens. The size of the front lens is an important consideration, as a larger lens gathers more light and is the main factor in determining how well the optics will assist your night vision in night use. Most authorities recommend a 7 x 50 binocular as best for marine use. A binocular may be individually focused (IF) for each eye or centrally focused (CF) for both eyes, with a minor adjustment on one eyepiece to balance any difference between a person’s two eyes. Both types are fine for marine use; choice is based on personal preference. There are also fixed-focus, nonadjusting binoculars.

Your hands cannot hold a binocular steady enough for boating use under many conditions. Two types of image-stabilized binoculars are available that can deliver steady images despite boat motion. Two stabilization techniques are used: Image Stabilization (IS), which deals most effectively with vibration, and gyrostabilization, a technique that stabilizes the optical path against the long-term motions common in rough sea conditions. Both types allow use of higher magnification—as high as 18 for IS types and 14 for gyro units—provided the batteries are supplying power. They complement but should not be considered a replacement for a 7 x 50 marine binocular.

They are somewhat larger and heavier than a regular binocular, but for most boaters, their advantages will outweigh these negative factors.

Keep your binocular in its case when you are not using it, and make sure the strap is around your neck when you are using it. Be careful when you put it down so that it cannot slide off and be damaged; even a rubber housing may not protect it from harm.

Flashlights Keep several flashlights or electric lanterns on your boat for emergency use, and extra batteries for them. At least one should be a red LED flashlight. Unlike the conventional red light obtained from an incandescent lamp and a red filter, the pure, monochromatic light from the red LED will not diminish your night vision. A red LED-equipped hand-held magnifier will be invaluable for reading chart details.

#### Your Own Piloting Tools

Every navigator eventually has his own favorite set of piloting tools. Don’t be concerned with choosing the “right” or the “best” instrument—choose tools with which you feel confident and learn to use them intuitively.

## MEASUREMENTS

If you are considering the measurement of various quantities for use in piloting, and the calculations in which they are used, you must first consider the appropriate standards of accuracy and precision.

Although often used interchangeably in everyday language, “accuracy” and “precision” are not synonymous. Precision relates to the degree of fineness of measurement of the value under consideration. Accuracy relates to how close the stated value is to the true or correct value.

Statements of distance as 32 miles or 32.0 miles are not quite the same things. The first merely says that to the best of observation and measurement the distance is not 31 nor 33 miles; the second says that it is not 31.9 nor 32.1 miles. Note the difference is the degree of precision of these two statements of the same distance. Never write 32.0 for 32 unless your measurements are sufficiently precise to warrant it.

The accuracy of the value recorded, regardless of how precisely it may or may not be stated, is determined by the tools and/or techniques used to measure it. Accuracy is sometimes stated as a value, such as “accurate to a half mile.” It can be stated as a probability, such as “100 meters CPE (circular probable error),” meaning that 50 percent of measurements will be within the stated distance.

Accuracy and precision are independent of each other. A measurement or calculation may be stated in very precise terms, but at the same time it may be inaccurate.

### Standard Limits of Precision

The navigation of vessels of various sizes naturally involves different standards of precision and accuracy, as befitting the conditions encountered. The piloting of small boats does not permit so high a degree of accuracy as on large ships that offer a more stable platform.

#### Direction

Direction is measured in small-craft navigation to the nearest whole degree. It is not reasonable to measure or calculate directions to a finer degree of precision when a boat is seldom steered closer than 2 or 3 degrees to the desired course.

#### Distance

Distances are normally expressed to the nearest tenth of a mile. This degree of precision, which works out to roughly 200 yards for a nautical mile, is reasonable in consideration of the size of the vessel and other measurement standards. On a chart at a typical scale of 1:40,000 this is less than 3/16 of an inch. Use of GPS affords greater degrees of precision and accuracy—commonly to within a few yards. But a malfunctioning GPS receiver may give you dangerously inaccurate positions and distances that are presented with a high (and highly deceptive) degree of precision. If you’re backstopping your electronic instruments with traditional piloting techniques, you won’t be lured into danger.

##### ROUNDING OF NUMBERS

In this chapter, the phrase “to the nearest…” is used frequently. Rounding is often employed to reduce various quantities to such limitations. For example, if you were to make a distance calculation for a speed of 13 knots for a time of 5 minutes, you would get 1.08333 on most electronic calculators (perhaps even more trailing “3s”). However, since distance is normally expressed to the nearest tenth of a mile, you would use it as 1.1 miles, the value arrived at by “rounding off,” as described below.

Any mathematical expression of a quantity has a certain number of “significant figures.” The quantity 4 has one significant figure, for instance; 4.2 or 14 each have two significant figures; 5.12, 43.8, and 609 each have three significant figures.

The process of reducing the number of significant figures is called “rounding.” To have uniform results, rules have been established for the rounding of numbers.

1. If the digit to be rounded off is 4 or less, it is dropped or changed to a zero.

8.23 is rounded to 8.2

432 is rounded to 430

2. If the digit to be rounded off is 6 or larger, the preceding digit is raised to the next higher value and the rounded digit is dropped or changed to a zero.

8.27 is rounded to 8.3

439 is rounded to 440

3. If the digit to be rounded off is a 5, it is desirable to round to the nearest even value, up or down.

8.25 is rounded to 8.2

435 is rounded to 440

This rule may seem arbitrary, but it is followed for consistency in results; it has an advantage that when two such rounded figures are added together and divided by two for an average, the result will not present a new need for rounding.

Note, however, that slightly different figures will result from using an electronic calculator. When a calculator or computer is set to display a fixed number of decimal places, a 5 to be rounded off nearly always results in the preceding digit being changed to the next higher—even or odd—number. (Internal calculations use the full range of numbers without rounding.) Computers, with their greater capabilities, can be programmed to round up only half of the time, when the preceding digit is odd; they round down for other numbers—this ensures less distortion of the final results.

4. Rounding can be applied to more than one final digit, but all such rounding must be done in one step. For example: 6148 is rounded to 6100 in a single action; do not round 6148 to 6150, and then round 6150 to 6200.

#### Time

Time is measured and calculated to the nearest minute. Fractions of a minute are rarely of any significance in routine piloting. In contests, however, time is calculated to decimal fractions and used in terms of seconds.

#### Speed

Measured electronically, speed through the water is usually indicated to the nearest tenth of a knot (miles per hour), especially at speeds less than 10 knots (mph). The accuracy of such readings does not support this level of precision unless the device has been carefully calibrated. Speed over the bottom (speed made good) may be accurately shown by a GPS receiver, and will be shown accurately when using Differential GPS. Speed is calculated to the nearest tenth of a knot or mile per hour. It is seldom accurately measurable to such fine units, but a calculation to the nearest tenth is not inconsistent with the expressed standards of precision of distance and time. This same degree of precision is used in calculations of current velocity.

#### Position

Geographic coordinates are expressed to the nearest tenth of a minute, or whole minute, of latitude and longitude, or to the nearest second, as determined by the scale of the chart. As explained in Chapter 15, latitude and longitude markings are subdivided into minutes and seconds on the larger-scale charts (1:50,000 and larger) and in fractions of minutes on smaller-scale charts (1:50,001 and smaller). The smallest scale charts may show whole minutes without fractions.

Don’t be misled by the displays of GPS receivers. Most models show position in latitude and longitude to a finer degree of precision than is warranted by the radionavigation system being used—one more decimal place than is justified.

#### Depths & Heights of Tide

Tidal variations in the depth of water are normally tabulated to the nearest tenth of a foot (or meter); calculations are carried out to the same degree of precision. Remember, however, that the effects on tidal action of winds and atmospheric pressure make this degree of precision hardly warranted.

## DEAD RECKONING

When operating your boat in large bodies of water, you should always have at least a rough knowledge of your position on the chart. Basic to such knowledge is a technique of navigation known as dead reckoning (DR). This is the advancement of the boat’s position on the chart from its last accurately determined location, using the courses steered and speeds though the water. Note that no allowance is made for the effects of wind, waves, current, or steering errors. This may seem strange, but the reasoning will become clear in Chapter 18, the chapter covering position determination.

Much navigation is now done with electronics, but equipment can fail—often at the worst possible time. And when it does, it is dead reckoning that will get you safely to your destination. Dead reckoning is not some relic left over from the days of sailing ships; it is an essential part of the navigation of any vessel.

#### Terms Used in Dead Reckoning

Dead reckoning follows some important conventions for recording information on the chart. The dr track (or dr track line) is the path that a boat would be expected to follow, or is believed to be following, without any allowance for the offsetting influences of wind, current, waves, and steering error. It is represented on the chart by a line drawn from the last known position using courses and distances through the water. The path the boat travels through the real world may be different from its DR track across the chart due to one or more offsetting influences, to be considered in Chapter 18.

Course, abbreviated “C,” is the direction in which a boat is to be steered or is being steered—in other words, the direction of travel through the water. Courses are normally plotted as true directions labeled with three-digit figures, with leading zeros added as necessary: 8° becomes 008; 42° becomes 042. The degree symbol is not used. Some skippers may plot and label courses as magnetic or compass directions. There is no need to add a “T” following the numbers if the course is a true direction, but do add a space following with “M” or “C” to indicate a magnetic or compass direction, if applicable.

Heading is different from course; it is the direction in which a boat is pointed at any given moment. For example, a sailboat proceeding upwind will typically have a heading that varies from its course by several degrees. Heading is often given in terms of magnetic or compass directions; these values are not part of a plot.

Speed, abbreviated “S,” is the rate of travel through the water. This is the DR track speed; it is used, together with elapsed time, to determine DR positions along the track line. (Speed is shown on a plot only for a vessel underway.)

Distance, abbreviated “D,” may be used with a DR plot of a future intended track.

#### The Basic Principles of Dead Reckoning

You should follow these basic principles of dead reckoning:

1. A DR track is always started from a known position.

2. For a DR track, use either true or magnetic courses consistently, and label appropriately.

3. Only the speed through the water is used for determining distance traveled and a DR position along the track. (The reason why speed over the bottom is not used is discussed in Chapter 18.)

Rules for when to plot a DR position are given on this page.

#### The Importance of Dead Reckoning

You should always plot a DR track when navigating in large, open bodies of water, especially when aids to navigation or landmarks are not available, or when visibility is poor. You should also plot a DR track whenever there is the possibility of an emergency arising. In such a situation it might suddenly be necessary to report your position to the Coast Guard or other source of assistance. In other words, keeping a DR track is a part of safe boating and is almost always important.

A DR track is the primary representation of your boat’s path, the base to which other factors, such as the effect of current, are applied. Dead reckoning is the basic method of navigation to which you will apply corrections and adjustments from other sources of information.

At the same time, remember that this DR track rarely represents your boat’s actual progress. If there were no steering errors, speed errors, or external influences, the DR track could be used as a means of determining your boat’s position at any time, as well as the ETA (estimated time of arrival) at a destination. But even with errors and external influences, a DR plot is always an important safety measure in the event of unexpected variations in current or an encounter with fog or other loss of visibility.

### Plotting

Fundamental to the use of dead reckoning is the use of charts and plots of a boat’s intended and actual positions. You should always use standard symbols and labels so your chartwork will be clear to you and understandable to another person (and to yourself at a later date!).

#### Basic Requirements

The basic requirements of plotting are accuracy, neatness, and completeness. All measurements taken from the chart must be made carefully, all direct observations must be made as accurately as conditions on a small boat permit, and all calculations should be made in full and in writing. If time permits, each of these actions should be repeated as a check; errors can be costly!

When plotting a course, neatness is essential to avoid a confusion of information on the chart. Drawing extra lines or overly long lines on charts or scribbling extraneous notes on them may obscure vital information.

Information on a chart must also be complete. You will often need to refer back to information you placed on the chart hours or days ago, and it can be dangerous to rely on memory to supply details.

#### Labeling

Draw lines on your charts lightly and no longer then necessary. Keep your straightedge slightly off the desired position of the line you are drawing, to allow for the thickness of the pencil point, no matter how fine it may be. Failure to do this may result in small errors that can accumulate and make your DR positions inaccurate

The requirements of neatness and completeness combine to establish a need for labeling. Immediately after drawing any line on a chart, or plotting any point, label it. The basic rules for labeling are:

1. The label for any line is placed along that line.

2. The label for any point should not be along any line—it should make an angle with any line so that its nature as the label of a point will be unmistakably clear.

The above basic rules are applied in the labeling of DR plots in the following manner:

• Use plain, block upper-case letters and numbers. Labels should be placed so that they can be read with the top or left side of the chart up. If space does not allow a label to be placed as described below, it is acceptable to place it in an adjacent clear area with an S-shaped arrow pointing to where it would normally appear.

• The direction label is placed above the track line as a three-digit number, preceded by “C” for course and followed, if applicable, by “M” or “C” to indicate magnetic or compass. Use a space between the figures and any letters. Note that “T” (for true direction), periods, and the degree symbol “°” are omitted; see Figure 16-22.

Figure 16-22 Course is labeled above the line with C followed by a space and the direction as a three-digit number (add leading zeros as necessary) followed by a space and then M or C if the direction is magnetic or compass; no letter is used if it is true. Speed is labeled beneath the line with the letter S in front of it. Or distance can be shown below the course line with the designator D. Note the space between the letters and the numbers here also.

• The speed along the track is indicated by numerals placed under the track line, usually directly beneath the direction and preceded by a space and the letter “S”; see Figure 16-22. Units, such as knots or mph, are omitted.

• A known position at the start of a DR track, a fix (see Chapter 18), is shown as a circle across the line; a small dot may be placed on the line for emphasis. It is labeled with time written horizontally; the word “fix” is understood and is not shown; see Figure 16-23.

Figure 16-23 A known position of the boat is plotted as a dot with a small circle around it. If it is at the intersection of two lines, the dot need not be used. Label the position with the time as a four-digit number in the 24-hour system, written horizontally.

• A DR position, calculated as a distance along the track at the set speed through the water, is shown as a half circle (with a dot) along the track line; it is labeled with the time placed at an angle to the course line but not horizontally. “DR” is understood and is not written in; see Figure 16-24.

Figure 16-24 A DR position along a track, without a change in course or speed, is plotted as a half-circle around a dot on the line. Add the time as for a known position, but not written horizontally.

• When planning and preplotting a run, speed, which is often affected by sea conditions, may not be known in advance. In this case, distance, “D,” may be labeled below the course line in lieu of speed; units (nautical or statute miles) are not shown.

Further applications of the basic rules of labeling will be given as additional piloting procedures and situations are introduced in Chapters 17 and 18.

All lines on a chart should be erased when no longer needed, to keep the chart clear. Erasures should be made as lightly as possible to avoid damaging the chart and obscuring its printed information.

### D, T & S Calculations

As mentioned earlier, calculations involving distance (D), time (T), and speed (S) are often made with a small mechanical (slide rule or circular) calculator. Use of a calculator is acceptable, but you should also be able to make your calculations accurately and quickly without one, using only a simple set of equations and ordinary arithmetic. The three basic equations are:

Where D is distance in miles, T is time in hours, and S is speed in knots or miles per hour as determined by the type of mile being used. Note carefully that T is in hours in these basic equations. To use time in minutes, as is more normally the case, the equations are modified to read:

Examples of the use of these practical equations may serve to make them clearer:

1. You are cruising at 14 knots; how far will you travel in 40 minutes?

Note that the calculated answer of 9.33 is rounded to the nearest tenth according to the rule for the degree of precision to be used in stating distance.

2. On one of the Great Lakes, it took you 40 minutes to travel 11 miles; what is your speed?

3. You have 9.5 miles to go to reach your destination; on a broad reach you are sailing at 6.5 knots; how long will it take you to get there?

Note again the rounding of results; the calculated answer of 87.6 minutes is used as 88 minutes. In powerboat piloting contests, however, it would probably be used as 87.6 minutes, or as 87 minutes 36 seconds.

The equations are also usable with kilometers and km/h. Memorize the three equations for distance, speed, and time. Practice using them until you are thoroughly familiar with them, and can get correct answers quickly. An easy way to remember is “60 D Street,” for the basic equation 60D = S x T.

#### The Three-Minute Rule

For short distances, the “Three-Minute Rule” is very handy. Add two zeros to the speed you are making in knots, and you will have the distance, in yards, that you will travel in three minutes, to an approximation close enough for practical navigation.

#### Use of Logarithmic Scale on Charts

Charts of the National Ocean Service (NOS) at scales of 1:40,000 and larger have printed on them a logarithmic speed scale.

To find speed: Place one point of your dividers on the mark on the scale indicating the distance in nautical miles, and the other point on the number corresponding to the time in minutes; see Figure 16-25. Without changing the spread between the divider arms, place the right point on the “60” at the right end of the scale; the left point will then indicate on the scale the speed in knots.

Figure 16-25 To use a logarithmic speed scale, set one point of the dividers on the scale division indicating the miles traveled and the other point on the number corresponding to the time, in minutes. With the dividers maintaining the same spread, transfer them so that the right point is on the “60” of the scale; the left point then indicates the speed in knots or mph.

To determine time: Use the same logarithmic scale to determine the time required to cover a given distance at a specified speed (for situations not exceeding one hour). Set the two divider points on the scale marks representing speed in knots and distance in miles. Move the dividers, without changing the spread, until the right point is at “60” on the scale; the other point will indicate the time in minutes.

To determine distance: Using knowledge of time and speed, distance likewise can be determined from this logarithmic scale. Set the right point of the dividers on “60” and the left point at the mark on the scale corresponding to the speed in knots. Then, without changing the spread, move the right point to the mark on the scale representing the time in minutes; the left point indicates the distance in nautical miles.

The logarithmic scale is used in the same manner with distances in statute miles and speeds in mph.

NOS charts have instructions for determining speed printed beneath the logarithmic scale, but not the procedures for determining distance or time. In all cases, you must know two of the three quantities in order to determine the other.

#### Use of S-D-T Calculators

It is not practicable here to give detailed instructions for operating all models of speed-distance-time slide rule or circular calculators. In general, they will have two or more scales, each logarithmically subdivided. The calculator will be set using two of the factors and the answer, the third factor, will be read off at an index mark; refer to Figure 16-20.

If you have a calculator for S-D-T problems, read the instructions carefully and practice with it sufficiently, using simple, self-evident problems, to be sure you can get reliable results later even in emergency.

### Speed Curves

Although many boats may have marine speedometers, the traditional method for determining speed of powerboats is through the use of engine speed as measured by a tachometer in revolutions per minute (rpm). A speed curve is prepared as a plot on cross-section (graph) paper of the boat’s speed in knots or mph for various engine speeds in rpm.

#### Factors Affecting Speed Curves

The boat’s speed at a specified engine setting may be affected by several factors. The extent of each effect will vary with the size of the boat, type of hull, and other characteristics.

Load is a primary factor influencing a boat’s speed. The number of people aboard, the amount of fuel and water in the tanks, and the amount and location of other weights on board will affect the depth to which the hull sinks into the water (the displacement) and the angular trim. Both displacement and trim may be expected to have an effect on speed.

Another major factor affecting speed is the underwater hull condition. Fouling growth like barnacles or moss increases the drag (the resistance to movement through the water), and slows the boat at any speed. Fouling on the propeller itself will drastically affect performance.

Whenever preparing speed data on a boat, note the loading and underwater hull conditions as well as the figures for rpm and speed. If you make a speed curve at the start of the season, when the bottom is clean, check it later in the season if your boat is used in waters where fouling is a problem. You may need a new speed curve, or you may be able to determine a small correction that can give you a more accurate determination of speed. You should also know what speed differences to expect from full tanks to half or nearly empty; the differences can be surprising.

#### Obtaining Speed Curves

Speed curves are obtained by making repeated runs over a known distance using different throttle settings and timing each run accurately. You can use any reasonable distance, but it should not be less than a half mile so small timing errors will not excessively influence the results; yet, it need not be more than a mile, to avoid excessive time and fuel requirements for the trials.

The run need not be an even half mile or mile if the distance is accurately known. Do not depend upon floating aids to navigation—they may be slightly off station, and, in any event, they have some scope on their anchor chains and will swing about under the effects of wind and current. Some areas will have a measured mile (or half mile); see Figure 16-26. These are accurately surveyed distances with each end marked by a range. Use these courses whenever possible; they are accurate, and calculations are easier with the even-mile distance. But do not let the absence of a measured mile keep you from making a speed curve. Wharves, fixed aids to navigation, or points of land will also give you the accurate distance you need.

Figure 16-26 Measured miles are often established and indicated on charts for measuring vessel speed. Even if your boat has a speedometer, make timed runs over this distance to check its accuracy.

In most speed trials you will need to run the known distance twice, one in each direction, in order to allow for the effects of current. Even in waters not affected by currents, you should make round-trip runs for each throttle setting to allow for wind effects.

For each one-way run, measure the time and steer your boat carefully to make the most direct run. Compute the speed for each run by the equations on this page. Tables are available that give speeds for various elapsed times over a measured mile. If the measured distance is an exact half mile, just divide the tabulated speeds by two. Then average the speeds of each pair of runs at a given rpm, for the true speed of the boat through the water. The strength of the current is one-half the difference between the speeds in the two directions of any pair of runs. Caution: do not average the times of a pair of runs to get a single time for use in the calculations; this will not give you the correct value for speed through the water.

If time is measured with a regular clock or watch, be careful in making the subtractions to get “elapsed time.” Remember that there are 60 seconds in each minute, not 100, and likewise 60 minutes in one hour. Most people are so used to decimal calculations that they make errors when “borrowing” in the subtraction of clock times.

If one is willing to use a slightly more complex equation, the boat’s speed through the water (or the strength of the current) can be found from a single calculation using the times of the two runs of each pair.

Where S is speed through the water in knots or mph

Cur is current in knots or mph

Tu is time upstream, in minutes

Td is time downstream, in minutes

D is distance, in nautical or statute miles

In preparing a speed curve for a boat, make enough pairs of runs to provide points for a plot of speed versus rpm; six or eight points will usually be enough for a satisfactory curve. With some types of hulls, there will be a break in the curve at a critical speed when the hull changes from displacement action to semi-planing action. At this portion of the curve you may need additional, more closely spaced measurements, so it is a good idea to calculate speed during runs and make a rough plot as you go along—obvious errors in timing will be readily seen.

You may also want to calculate the current’s strength for each pair of runs. The current values will probably vary during the speed trials, but the variations should be small and in a consistent direction, either steadily increasing or decreasing, or going through a slack period. You will get the best results by running your trials at a time of minimum current.

#### Example of a Speed Curve

A set of speed trials was run for the motor yacht Trident over the measured mile off Kent Island in Chesapeake Bay. This is an excellent course because it is marked by buoys offshore as well as by ranges on land. The presence of the buoys aids in steering a straight run from one end of the course to the other; the ranges are used for accuracy in timing.

On this particular day, it was not convenient to wait for slack water, but a time was selected that would result in something less than maximum ebbing current. A table was set up in the log, and runs were made in each direction at speeds of normal interest from 900 rpm to 2150 rpm, which was maximum for the Detroit 6-71 diesels.

The results of the runs are shown in Figure 16-27, upper. An entry was also made in the log that these trials were made with fuel tanks 0.4 full, the water tanks approximately one-third full, and with a clean bottom. The column of the table marked “Current” is not necessary, but it serves as a flag to quickly expose any inconsistent data. Note that on these trials the current is decreasing at a reasonably consistent rate.

Figure 16-27 During the speed trials for Trident, the results were tabulated as shown at top. Runs were made in each direction to account for the effect of current. Entries in the craft’s log were made for the hull bottom condition and the state of fuel and water tanks. The speed curve at bottom, plotted from these data, is accurate only for load and hull conditions similar to those during the speed trials.

After the runs had been completed, a plot was made on cross-section paper of the boat’s speed as a function of engine rpm. This resulted in the speed curve shown as Figure 16-27, lower.

### Dead Reckoning Plots

With knowledge of dead reckoning terms and principles, the rules for labeling points and lines, and the procedures for making calculations involving distance, time, and speed, you can now consider the use of DR plots.

There are several specific rules for making and using DR plots.

• A DR plot should be started when leaving a known position; see Figure 16-28.

Figure 16-28 A dead reckoning (DR) plot is started when leaving a known position. This is plotted as a fix, with the time labeled; course and speed are labeled along the course line.

• A DR position should be shown whenever a change is made in course (see Figure 16-29, plot A) or in speed (see Figure 16-29, plot B) or both course and speed.

Figure 16-29 Whenever a change in course is made a DR position is plotted for that time; the new course and speed are labeled along the new DR track. If a variation in speed is made without a change in direction, B, a DR position is plotted for that time, and new course and speed labels are entered following it.

• A DR position should be plotted each hour on the hour (more frequently under conditions of reduced visibility); see Figure 16-30.

Figure 16-30 A DR position should basically be plotted every hour on the hour. In conditions of reduced visibility, the interval between DR positions should be shortened. The course shown here is referenced to true north.

• A new DR track should be started each time the boat’s position is fixed. The old DR position for the same time as the fix should also be shown at the end of the old DR track; see Figure 16-31.

Figure 16-31 Start a new DR track whenever the boat’s position is fixed. In this example, a fix is obtained when the craft passes alongside an identified aid to navigation. Label the old DR with the same time as the fix.

## FUNDAMENTALS OF GPS NAVIGATION

After the ship’s compass, the most ubiquitous instrument of modern navigation is, without doubt, the GPS receiver. Created by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1970s, GPS technology can now be found in everything from smartphones to airplanes, automobiles, rail and bus systems, a wilderness hiker’s gear, and boats of all kinds and descriptions. GPS is easy to use (automatic in many cases), world-wide in coverage, usually accurate within meters, and only marginally affected by weather conditions. It works in daylight, snow, hail, sleet, fog, and the dark of night.

Yet despite the advantages of GPS—which is rendered even more useful and convenient when a chartplotter or laptop software uses the GPS signal to place your boat on a digital chart—you are well advised to master the traditional piloting skills and to maintain an hourly DR plot as described above. The reasons for this are touched on in the beginning of this chapter and can be summed up by the phrase “situational awareness.” There is no surer way than plotting your intended DR track with a pencil on a paper chart to prevent you from shaping a course into danger. There is no more reliable way to ensure that you discover a malfunctioning GPS in timely fashion than by maintaining an hourly DR plot. (GPS receivers rarely malfunction, and GPS satellite signals are rarely degraded, but all it takes is once.) Should a GPS receiver or chartplotter cease to function altogether, there is no more sure-footed way to continue a safe voyage than by having a DR plot to fall back on. And there is no more concrete and intuitive way of assessing the impacts of current and leeway on your course and speed over ground than by comparing your DR position with a position fix for the same time; see Chapters 17 and 18.

A navigator needs to maintain situational awareness of the surrounding world just as an automobile driver does. The GPS receiver on an automobile dashboard might call for a left turn in 0.5 mile, but the driver considers what he or she knows of alternative routes, the traffic ahead, road construction, and other factors before following that advice. Blind adherence is never wise. A navigator should keep track of his or her position by at least two techniques, verifying one against the other. Electronic navigation is easy and accurate, but traditional piloting techniques never quit. Know and use both.

##### HOW A GPS RECEIVER DETERMINES POSITION

In essence, a marine GPS receiver measures the distance between itself and three satellites in space, and uses those distances as the radii of three spheres, each having one of the satellites as its center. Then, using spherical geometry, it determines its position as the intersection of those three spheres.

The system is based on a network of 24 satellites launched in the late 1970s and early 1980s for military use; the U.S. Government made the system available for civilian use starting in the 1980s. The satellites circle the earth twice a day in six planes at an altitude of 10,900 nautical miles (20,200 km), an inclination angle to the equator of 55 degrees, and a speed of 7,000 miles an hour. Because of the satellites’ altitude and orbital patterns, at least four satellites are observable by a ground-based GPS receiver at all times; sometimes as many as eight or even ten can be received simultaneously. This means fixes can be obtained from the system continuously.

The signal from each satellite has two parts: One is a digital code, unique to that satellite, which identifies it. Also transmitted is a navigation message that contains updated information about the satellite’s orbit (technically referred to as “ephemeris data”); what time it is as far as the satellite is concerned (GPS time); almanac data for all the satellites in the constellation; and coefficients a ground-based receiver can plug into a computer model stored in its memory to calculate how the atmosphere is affecting the signal’s transmission through the ionosphere. (This is known as signal propagation.)

The satellite tells the receiver the instant in GPS time in which the signal was transmitted, and the receiver synchronizes itself (approximately) to GPS time. Since time, speed, and distance are interrelated—by multiplying the difference between the time that the satellite transmitted the signal and the time that it reached the receiver by the signal’s speed (186,000 statute miles per second)—the receiver calculates its approximate distance (called a pseudorange) from the satellite. The receiver’s computation of this distance could be absolutely accurate if it contained an atomic clock, but that would make the receiver prohibitively expensive. Instead, the receiver contains a crystal oscillator that is synchronized with the satellite’s clock to the precision required for accurate position fixing.

As shown in this illustration, a GPS receiver determines vessel position by taking virtually instantaneous readings from at least three satellites, the distance from each becoming the radius of a sphere. The receiver calculates the vessel’s position as the point at which the three spheres intersect.

If the receiver could determine distance with absolute accuracy, signals from two satellites would suffice to fix latitude and longitude. Since it cannot determine distance with absolute accuracy, it acquires the pseudorange from a third satellite and adjusts the three pseudoranges in equal amounts until the three LOPs converge to determine the clock error in all three signals and then eliminate it.

The receiver uses the pseudoranges it has computed from the satellites it is observing to solve three simultaneous equations (one for each satellite) with three unknowns (latitude, longitude, and clock error), and produces an estimate of its position. It next must account for its own velocity during the process of acquiring and processing the satellite signals. It does this by comparing the frequencies of the satellite signals against that of a reference signal that the receiver generates internally. From the Doppler effect (this is the effect you note in the sound-wave frequency of a train’s whistle as it approaches you, passes you, then recedes into the distance), the receiver computes its velocity relative to each of the satellites it is observing. The receiver then recalculates the earlier three equations using velocity rather than pseudoranges. After using the solution to those three equations to allow for its own velocity in the earlier estimated position, the receiver produces a fix. (The signal from a fourth satellite is required to determine altitude, a requirement for aeronautical but not for recreational marine applications.) From then on, the receiver can calculate other information, such as boat speed, track, range to a destination, and much more.

### GPS Accuracy, DGPS, and WAAS

Modern GPS receivers are extremely accurate almost all the time, subject only to their ability to “see” satellites through potential blockages such as thick foliage or high buildings. Such hindrances are rarely an issue for marine use, and when functioning normally, most civilian GPS receivers are accurate to within a 15-meter range.

differential GPS (DGPS) corrects GPS signals to an accuracy of one to three meters. The DGPS system consists of a network of towers that receive GPS signals and then transmit a corrected signal out to their broadcast range, from 75 to several hundred miles, depending on the station; see Figure 16-32. DGPS was developed in the late 1980s to improve GPS accuracy when the publicly available GPS signal was being degraded through Selective Availability (SA). The U.S. Coast Guard discontinued DGPS sites in the United States in 2020, as SA was permanently discontinued and other government and commercial augmentation systems have become readily available (see WAAS below). DGPS coverage is still available for Canada and some foreign countries.

Figure 16-32 In Differential GPS, the differences between the known locations and GPS-measured positions of a number of GPS radiobeacons are determined, and corrections are transmitted that can be received by boats and ships to improve the accuracy of their positions.

The WAAS (wide area augmentation system) corrects GPS signals to provide an accurate position within three meters 95 percent of the time. Developed by the Federal Aviation Administration and the U.S. Department of Transportation to provide differential corrections for aeronautical services, the WAAS system consists of ground stations that monitor GPS data. Master stations collect information from the other ground stations and broadcast corrections to geostationary satellites. These corrected WAAS signals are then retransmitted on the same frequency as the basic GPS signals down to your boat, so no separate receiver or antenna is needed. To date, WAAS coverage is available only in North America, although other governments are developing similar systems around the world. Many marine GPS receivers are now available that use WAAS corrections in lieu of the basic GPS service. Some allow the user to switch between DGPS and WAAS.

Figure 16-33 This handheld GPS displays charts and navigation data in an easy-to-use format, either as a primary source or as a backup on a larger vessel.

### GPS Receivers

A wide variety of handheld and installed GPS receivers are available from many manufacturers. Some portable units are designed only to be handheld, and these operate off an integral antenna. Others can be either handheld or mounted at a vessel’s navigation station or helm using an externally mounted antenna and drawing power from the boat’s electrical system. For offshore cruisers, a handheld GPS receiver is a valuable component of the “abandon-ship bag.”

Some fixed-mount GPS receivers include their signal acquisition and navigation computing equipment along with their display in a single unit mounted at a vessel’s navigation station or helm. Other installed receivers have their signal acquisition and computing equipment in an antenna, called a GPS sensor, mounted with a clear “view” of the sky, and a separate display mounted at the navigation station or helm. The two components must be connected by a cable. For vessels with more than one helm, these units can operate multiple displays from a single antenna; position information can also be transmitted over a data network for display on a fishfinder, radar, or chartplotter, as discussed in the final section of this chapter.

Figure 16-34 This GPS unit displays fundamental navigation information on this screen: Latitude/longitude, speed over the ground, and course over the ground. Other screens will have more information to guide you to waypoints and routes. Note the MOB (man-overboard) button. A sophisticated unit that can be used on any vessel, either as a primary GPS or a secondary one on a bridge, it is accurate within a few yards.

#### GPS Receiver Features

A full-function GPS receiver can do much more than simply display a vessel’s geographical position with predictable accuracy. The GPS data display can include the vessel’s course and speed over the ground (COG and SOG), these being continuously computed from successive position data. Courses and bearings can be shown as true or magnetic, with magnetic courses derived either from stored values for variation or user-entered variation. The obvious utility of this information will be explored in Chapter 17. Since courses and headings are derived from successive positions, heading information is not available when the craft is stationary. There are, however, GPS compasses that use two or three antennas spaced apart from each other and a special receiver to derive highly accurate heading data; see this page.

Internal memory can be used to store the coordinates of waypoints for future use; routes can be preplanned using a series of waypoints. Most sets can store multiple routes and can, with a single key press, reverse the direction of a route. Along a route, transfers from one leg to the next can be automatic or manual, with an alarm being sounded as each waypoint is approached; some models can be programmed to switch from one route to another.

Internal computing capabilities can determine the distance and direction (true or magnetic) between pairs of waypoints. Using computed track and present position data, a GPS receiver can show cross-track error and how to steer to get back on track. This information can be fed into an autopilot for continuous course correction without action by the helmsman. (But always remember to keep a sharp lookout for other vessels and navigational hazards.) Combining its knowledge of speed, distance, and time, a GPS receiver can display how long it will take to reach a destination and give an ETA.

GPS receivers can save a vessel’s position at any time with a push of a button. This feature, routinely used to establish new waypoints, is used as a “man overboard” function that will create a memory-protected MOB position, automatically presenting the heading to and distance from the MOB position.

GPS signals include very precise time information that can be displayed as local time or time at the prime meridian (0° longitude), formerly known as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) but now referred to as Universal Coordinated Time (UTC) or “Zulu.” However, you must be aware that “GPS Time” is not the same as actual, correct UTC. Every year or so, UTC is adjusted to compensate for the very gradual slowing of the earth’s rotation; a “leap second” is added to UTC. The clocks of GPS satellites, out in space, are not adjusted. Some GPS receivers have a correction built in as of the date of their design and manufacture, while others do not; some receivers may have a slight lag between time calculation and display. Many units will also give sunrise and sunset times for the current position of the vessel and tidal information for a tabulated station located nearby.

Many GPS receivers can also be programmed to stand an anchor watch by describing a small circle around a vessel’s anchored position and having the receiver sound an alarm if the vessel drifts outside that circle. An alarm can be programmed for an off-track error greater than a preset amount or for an approach to a place that is to be avoided, or the receiver can be programmed to function as an alarm clock or count-down timer. Another valuable function is a “watch alert” that can be set to sound at preset intervals and must be manually turned off by the helmsman, who might have dozed off.

### GPS Antennas

External GPS antennas are small. Some are 1 to 2 inches in diameter and 12 to 15 inches high; others are 3 inches in diameter but only 2 inches high. All must be mounted on a vessel’s exterior with a 360-degree view of the horizon. Mounting should only be high enough to provide a clear view all around the horizon—too great a height results in excessive motion of the antenna due to the pitch and roll of the vessel, which can degrade the accuracy of the position. A GPS antenna should not be mounted where it will be in the beam of radar pulses, but a separation from communications antennas of only a few feet is adequate.

## CHARTPLOTTERS

Electronic charts were covered on this page—here we will see how they are used, and their most frequent use as of this writing is in a chartplotter, which is also referred to by some as a “chart plotter” or an “electronic charting system”; see Figure 16-35. These are the small-craft counterparts to the electronic chart display and information systems (ECDISs) used on large ships. It must be remembered, however, that a chartplotter is not a substitute for having the proper paper charts on board.

Figure 16-35 A chartplotter lets you choose from a series of navigation screens to help you find your way. A digital highway is displayed on the screen at left, illustrating your course to steer. The screen at right shows how you can put the curser on an object, in this case the Thorn Knoll green buoy, to pull down specific information. (The Thorn Knoll nun buoy is green rather than red because this example is from IALA-A waters; see this page.)

Most chartplotters now come preloaded with charts. Some show the entire U.S. and coastal waters, but many manufacturers offer one of four basic areas of the U.S., and if you want more than whatever was preloaded, you have to buy the charts separately. Formerly the charts would come on a CD-ROM, but now they usually come on a memory card or chip.

An electronic chart reader can be a stand-alone device merely displaying the information that is stored internally or inputted from a data card, but more often they are combined with a GPS or DGPS receiver so that the vessel’s position is shown on the chart display. (Disks and cards are available from several commercial sources.) In this manner, the tedious step of transferring a location in latitude and longitude from a GPS display to a paper chart is avoided, and the possibility of plotting error is eliminated. (Some GPS receivers have rudimentary chart information internally stored in memory, but without the capability of receiving external chart information; these are not true “chartplotters.”)

Chartplotter displays are LCD panels, either monochrome or color; the number of pixels (resolution) will vary with the size and cost of the unit. Screens are normally backlit at variable intensity for nighttime use; some models will have a transflective display for usable visibility in conditions of bright light, such as on a flybridge; these displays get brighter as the light falling on them gets stronger. Many models store track information that can be reviewed later or reversed to lead you back to a starting point. Displays can be selected as “north up” or “heading up,” similar to radar displays. Newer models have touchscreen displays for convenient, weather-resistant helm-station use. One problem with these touchscreens, however, is that they can quickly become so smudged by sunblock-coated fingers as to be unreadable. Note too that entering a waypoint on a touchscreen becomes a real challenge when you’re underway in a seaway. With the boat bouncing from wave to wave, it’s hard to touch the screen where you intend. You may have to stop the boat in order to make an entry.

The full range of internally calculated information from a GPS receiver is usually available for display at the margins of a chartplotter screen. A split screen may allow the simultaneous display of data and a chart, or a chart and a fishfinder view of the water beneath the boat; some can show a chart and an aerial photograph of the same area, usually a harbor or harbor entrance. Radar displays can be superimposed on a chart at the same scale or shown on a split screen. On some models, the overlaid radar display can be made semitransparent so that chart details can be read through it.

Data from other electronic devices that can be shown on some models include depth information, speed through the water, water temperature, wind speed and direction, etc. Chartplotters interconnected with a VHF-DSC radio can show the position of a vessel in distress if the Mayday message contains that information; if set up to do so, the location of any boat calling can be shown on the plotter, and the DSC radio can be used to request another boat to transmit its position, which will be shown. Some models, on craft fitted with appropriate sensors, can even display fuel usage and remaining availability—the possibilities are almost endless!

A recently developed chartplotter, when used with an appropriate electronic chart, can sound an alarm when depths shoal beyond a preset minimum in the path ahead of the boat; this is based on charted depths and must be adjusted for tidal conditions; no measurements are taken. It can also warn of land, man-made objects, and other charted features as selected. The unit takes an input of position from its internal GPS receiver and scans the chart in an arc 15° either side of dead ahead out to a distance of 1/4 to 1 mile, as selected; the distance should be chosen with reference to the speed of the craft. Caution: This system relies upon the information included on the chart; it cannot warn against an uncharted depth or obstruction.

WARNING It must always be remembered that on small craft, a chartplotter is not a full replacement for paper charts. Even a 10-inch color display shows much less information than you can quickly scan from a conventional chart. Knowing how to zoom, pan, and scroll the display on your chartplotter will help, but you must still have a full-size chart at hand for when you need the full picture.

Figure 16-36 The 14-inch display of this touchscreen-or-manual MFD (see this page) shows a detailed raster chart at left and radar and sonar images at right.

Figure 16-37 This MFD (see this page) with 9-inch touchscreen display shows a radar image standing alone at right and overlaid on a raster-and-satellite-photo chart at left. This unit will interface with a smartphone or tablet.

Figure 16-38 In this split-screen chartplotter, the colorful vector screen on the left with depth and channel information also has icons representing much more available information. The traditional raster screen on the right has the familiar look of NOAA paper charts, from which it has been digitized.

## COMPUTERS ON BOARD

With the advance of solid-state technology, which packages more and more power and versatility into smaller and smaller components, using a sophisticated personal computer with a rechargeable power supply on board a recreational vessel is not difficult or complicated.

Typical desktop personal computers require 120-volt AC power input, but that’s because they are designed primarily for use on land, where that is the power normally available. In fact, the computer circuits themselves run on less than 6 volts of DC electrical current, which is provided by the computer’s power supply (a stepdown transformer plus a rectifier that converts 120-volt AC power to multiple DC voltages such as 12, 5, or 3.3).

The easiest way to use a personal computer on board a boat with 12-volt battery power is with an inverter that changes the battery’s 12-volt DC power to 120-volt AC power, which the computer’s power supply will then step down and rectify to the required voltages. The computer’s power supply should be from a dedicated circuit with its own breaker on the main distribution panel to protect it from sudden voltage drops as other equipment comes on and off line. The computer should then be connected to the inverter through a surge protector to guard against sudden voltage spikes.

At 120-volt input, the current draw of a desktop personal computer is about 1.5 amps. If the AC power is being produced by an inverter, that equates to approximately a 16-amp DC draw on a 12-volt system after allowing for the inverter’s 15 percent efficiency loss. While this is an easily manageable power level on board a boat equipped with a genset, it could be too great for a vessel that relies strictly on an engine alternator to recharge its batteries. A more practical approach on medium-size and smaller craft, especially those without a genset, is a portable laptop or notebook computer that can be operated for several hours on an internal battery; see Figure 16-39. Laptop computers are necessarily energy efficient and are therefore ideal for onboard use, especially when operated from a small DC/AC inverter. The power from the inverter will keep the computer’s battery at full charge, while the battery acts as an excellent electrical filter against electrical noise on the boat’s DC power bus and functions as an uninterruptible power supply, keeping the computer on line during engine starts or when switching batteries. The inverter’s power drain will typically be less than what would be required to power a desktop computer. (Also available are DC/DC power cords that eliminate the need for an inverter.)

Figure 16-39 A notebook computer can serve many purposes on a boat, including navigation, log keeping, and administration of supplies and spare parts. It can also serve the same uses as a computer at home or in an office—word processing, data recording, and entertainment. Alternatively, many boaters now are using chartplotters and multi-function displays at the helm and smartphones, iPads, or other wireless-enabled tablets elsewhere on board, leaving their laptops ashore.

More computers designed for marine use (rugged and weatherproof) are entering the market. Available software includes programs for tide and current predictions, current sailing, Mercator and great circle sailing, celestial navigation, and other boating activities. And, of course, the computer can be used for the same word processing, database, and spreadsheet work as at home or the office, and younger members of the crew can play their games. Internet connections are widely available both in port and underway.

A primary application is with navigation software to serve as a chartplotter. Starting in the 1990s, software companies developed navigation programs that enable boat owners to plan future trips from the comfort of their homes or offices. You could input waypoints and routes on your Mac or PC and then download them to a chartplotter at the helm or simply take the laptop down to the boat. There are still many such programs, and now they also operate on electronic pads and tablets, even on smartphones. You can download a full complement of U.S. coastal charts and some foreign charts from Navionics to your tablet. The program is GPS enabled, so you can see where you are. The screen is small, of course, and should by no means be your sole source of navigation information, but it’s great for cruise planning and for use as a backup underway.

The electronic charts used with a chartplotter, and the navigational software used with a personal computer or even a smartphone, may also include a database with additional information such as available marine facilities, tide predictions, and other information useful to a cruising boater. Because of the possibility of equipment failure or loss of electrical power, the availability of such supplemental information should be considered a convenience only—a full backup of texts and tables should always be on board.

#### Further Precautions

• Computer equipment must be carefully protected from rain and spray. This equipment should be run periodically to ensure that internal parts are dry.

• Disk drives and printers have moving parts that can be damaged by vibration and shock. They must be mounted securely and cushioned as much as possible. Laptop, notebook, and tablet computers, being designed to travel, are more resistant to shock and vibration, but even they should be cushioned when underway.

• Computer circuits may generate radio interference and should be mounted well away from sensitive navigation and communications electronics.

## RADAR

Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging) is the only navigation tool that can measure both direction and distance to a moving or still target, and thus can be used both for position fixing (see Chapter 18) and for collision avoidance. What’s more, it can do so under almost any condition of visibility. In fact, radar can almost always make a measurement despite fog, light rain, or darkness. (Heavy rain, however, can decrease and may even prevent radar from detecting targets.) Radar measurements of distance are quite precise and accurate—much more so than vertical sextant measurements or optical range-finder readings discussed in Chapter 18.

Radar offers an excellent means of extending the coverage provided by a visual lookout, especially at night and in reduced visibility. This greater range of detection affords more time for a vessel to maneuver in order to avoid another craft or a detected obstacle. With a radar plot, an early determination can be made of another vessel’s course and speed. Radar also helps when making a landfall from offshore; running a coast and picking up landmarks for fixes; or traveling in confined waters, entering an inlet, and the like. Radar has real advantages, even in the daytime, and of course becomes particularly helpful at night or in conditions of reduced visibility.

Although the Navigation Rules require that radar, if on board, be used in conditions of reduced visibility, it is important to understand that radar is not a substitute for a human lookout required by Rule 5; refer to Chapter 5 and Figure 5-06.

The basic technology that radar employs has been available since before WW II, but the advent in recent years of digital signal processing and integrated circuitry has allowed a number of improvements in its ability to define (clearly outline) targets, as well as in how its information is displayed. A good radar set is an extremely valuable piece of equipment because of its ability to detect the presence, range, and bearing of distant objects in any weather, and to track some forms of weather, such as rainstorms.

Figure 16-40 A standard radar display presents the vessel’s position at the center of the screen and the vessel’s heading at the 12 o’clock position. With each rotation of the antenna, reflected radar pulses reveal the objects they detect.

### Radar Equipment

A standard radar’s components consist of a transmitter that generates radio waves and includes a modulator that causes the radio waves to be generated in brief pulses; an antenna that radiates the radio waves and collects the returning echoes (see Figure 16-41); a receiver that detects the returned reflections and amplifies them to usable strength; and a display that presents the pattern of received echoes on a cathode-ray tube (CRT) or liquid crystal display (LCD) and includes rotary knobs, buttons, key pads, and sometimes a joystick or trackball for certain operator-controlled functions. The radars used on small craft normally group these components in two units. The antenna, the transmitter, and a portion of the receiver are housed in one unit, mounted as high on the vessel as practical. The remainder of the receiver and the display are housed in a second unit, normally installed near the vessel’s helm. Many manufacturers also offer a remote display that allows a second presentation of the picture on the master display at a second steering station such as on a powerboat’s flybridge or a navigator’s station below.

Figure 16-41 A marine radar operates by transmitting very brief pulses of super high-frequency radio waves. These are reflected back by other vessels, aids to navigation, landmasses, and other “targets.” The speed of the pulses is so great that an echo is received before the next pulse is sent out.

Transmitters for use on recreational vessels are rated by their peak pulse power output, from 1 kW to about 25 kW. The power taken from the boat’s electrical system is much less, from 30 watts to about 600 watts.

##### HOW RADAR DETECTS OBJECTS

Radar works by transmitting a tightly focused beam of super-high-frequency radio waves from a rotating antenna mounted as high as practical on a vessel, then measuring the time it takes for the radio wave pulses that are reflected from distant objects to travel from and back to the antenna; refer to Figure 16-41. By multiplying that time interval by the speed of radio waves—161,875 nautical miles per second (299,793 km/s)—the system can determine the distance between the antenna and the objects that reflected radio waves back to it.

The bearing to an object is determined by the direction in which the antenna is pointing when it transmits its radio wave beam and receives a reflection (often called an echo). The antenna’s rotation during the time interval between the pulse being sent out and its return is not a factor in determining the bearing of an object, because it makes only one revolution every 0.8 to 4 seconds but transmits pulses of radio waves at the rate of 400 to 6,000 per second. Since it takes the radio waves only a fraction over 12 microseconds (millionths of a second) per nautical mile of range to make their round trip, the antenna can send and receive up to 25 pulses in the time it takes to rotate just one degree, which means that, electronically speaking, it is standing still.

Because the radio waves that a radar transmits are bent by the atmosphere and follow the earth’s curvature, its horizon at any particular mounting height is about 7 percent farther away than the horizon of the human eye at that same height. The maximum range at which a particular radar can detect an object and the clarity with which it can define targets depend on four factors—the strength of the radio wave signal it transmits, the sensitivity with which it can detect and interpret reflected radio waves, the length of its antenna and the height at which the antenna is mounted on the vessel, and the height of the object itself (see illustration below).

As the reflected radio waves are received, they are displayed on a screen normally mounted adjacent to a vessel’s helm. The pattern of all the reflected radio waves that are received on each successive sweep of the antenna clearly reveals the existence of the objects they detect.

This does not necessarily mean that the image displayed on a radar screen will match exactly what is seen with the human eye or on a navigation chart. Low-lying targets such as a beach along a coast will not show up as well as tall buildings several hundred yards inland. Radar cannot “see” through a mountain to reveal a harbor entrance on the other side, and the reflection from a large object such as a commercial ship can mask the reflection of a smaller vessel behind it or nearby.

A radar’s range depends on the mounting height of its antenna and on the height of the objects that reflect the radio waves it transmits. (Not to scale; curvature of the earth exaggerated for emphasis.)

Figure 16-42 An LCD radar display on a busy boating day clearly identifies other vessels. You can see where they’ve been by their digitized “tails” as they have moved through the water, and you can adjust course as necessary to avoid them. In this instance, the captain would want to keep a watch on the vessel approaching off his starboard quarter.

#### Radar Antennas

Small-craft radar antennas range in length from about 17 inches to 6.5 feet (45 cm to 2.0 m). Antennas under about 2 feet (61 cm) in length are usually enclosed in a radome, a fiberglass housing most often used to prevent a sailboat’s sails from becoming entangled in the rotating antenna. A radome does not affect the quality of an antenna’s radio wave transmission but does limit the size of an antenna.

The longer an antenna, the narrower the horizontal width of the beam of radio waves it transmits. A 17-inch (43-cm) radome antenna, for example, would typically transmit a 5.7° horizontal beam; a 3.5-foot (1.1-m) open-array antenna might transmit a 2.4° beam; and a 6.5-foot (2.0 m) antenna might transmit a 1.23° beam. The narrower a radar’s beam width is, the greater will be its ability to separate targets; this is called bearing discrimination. The vertical beam width of radar antennas is typically 25° regardless of the length of the antenna and is necessary in order to assure the detection of close-in targets when the vessel is heeled or rolling from port to starboard.

Radar sets are designed with a number of different range scales—longer ranges for coverage of a larger area and the earlier detection of “targets,” and shorter ranges for better detail of nearby waters. The maximum range scales for radars found on board recreational boats generally vary from about 16 to 72 nautical miles, but these figures can be misleading. The maximum range at which an object can be detected is most limited by the curvature of the earth—with transmitter power, receiver sensitivity, and antenna performance playing lesser roles. Although a longer range may be used for tracking weather, such as thunderstorms or large rain squalls, a boat radar is usually operated on a range scale of 3 to 8 miles. Range scales of less than one mile are used when navigating a channel or in close quarters with other vessels.

Figure 16-43 The larger a radar antenna is, the better will be its bearing discrimination, the ability to separate two targets close together. In some instances, however, such as on a sailboat, it is desirable to use a smaller antenna enclosed in a radome.

#### Antenna Location

A radar antenna should be mounted high enough to ensure that the beam will not illuminate GPS antennas or anyone on board. While range increases somewhat with elevation, the gain is offset by the increased radius of the radar blind area created by the antenna’s 25° vertical beam angle. A height of about 20–22 feet is appropriate, though not possible on many small boats.

#### Radar Displays

Older analog radars presented target echo information on cathode-ray tubes equipped with long-persistence phosphor screens. These screens kept the image acquired during a single rotation of the antenna visible until refreshed by the next rotation. Today’s “raster scan” radars digitize and store the information they acquire in a memory and then repeatedly deliver the stored information to the screen of a TV-like fast-response CRT or LCD, presenting a non-fading, easy-to-see image.

LCD screens are used in almost all small-craft radars and, to an ever-increasing extent, in ship radars as well. Most displays use color to enhance the user’s ability to interpret the on-screen information. The information gathered by the radar is differentiated into four levels according to the strength of the detected echo, with color used to indicate the strength of the target signature to the operator. A substantial amount of alphanumeric information may also be presented on the screen. Most models now have connections so that networked data from other electronic devices, such as GPS and depth information, can be displayed on the screen.

### Radar Capabilities

As mentioned above, radar displays allow an operator to select from a variety of scales ranging from ⅛ mile up to the unit’s maximum range. Most displays overlay concentric circles (“rings”) on the display to divide the selected range into a number of equal units, thus allowing rapid estimates of the distance to any object that is reflecting the antenna’s transmitted radio waves. Most also offer at least one variable range marker (VRM), a movable concentric circle that the operator can place directly over the image of a detected object with a knob, pushbutton, joystick, or trackball. The display will then read out digitally the range to the object.

Another common feature is an electronic bearing line (EBL), a movable straight line that pivots around the center point of the screen, which the operator can place over the image of a detected object. The display will then digitally read out the relative bearing from the vessel to the object. More expensive radars offer multiple VRMs and EBLs.

Some radars allow the operator to zoom in on a portion of the display to present that segment in greater detail. While most radars display the vessel’s position at the center of the screen, some radars allow the operator to “off-center” the display to provide greater coverage to one particular portion of the display.

The standard orientation of a radar display is “head-up”—the vessel’s heading is always toward the 12 o’clock position on the radar screen. The display of radars that are interfaced with an electronic compass can present a “north-up” display in which compass north is at the 12 o’clock position on the screen. Some electronic compasses can be programmed to automatically compute variation and present true north at the 12 o’clock position on the screen of an interfaced radar.

More sophisticated radars also offer such features as echo tracking, which graphically presents the track of other vessels on the display screen. Some radar manufacturers also offer optional target plotting aids, which allow selected models of their radars to track up to 10 targets simultaneously; display their range, bearing, and closest point of approach (CPA); and sound an alarm if a target violates preset CPA limits. If these radars are also interfaced with an appropriate navigation sensor such as a GPS receiver, they can also display target courses in relative or true degrees and present the time to closest point of approach (TCPA).

Most radars can be interfaced with navigation sensors such as GPS receivers to digitally display one’s own vessel course and speed over the ground and destination waypoint on the radar screens. When interfaced with a GPS chartplotter, they can graphically plot the vessel’s track on either their radar picture or the chart representation.

Most radars also allow a guard zone—all-round or only for a defined sector—to be drawn around the vessel on which they are installed, and will sound an alarm if that zone is violated. This feature can be valuable as an anti-collision device when underway, and also as an anchor watch.

### Developing Radar Skills

Radar, even more than other piloting methods, requires considerable practice and accumulation of experience. Develop your radar procedures during fair weather and good conditions so that they are readily available in difficult circumstances and you can use them with confidence. It is not possible to simply install radar on your boat and immediately use it effectively. For both navigation and collision avoidance, the scene shown on the display will require interpretation, which requires study and experience. The full value of having radar on your boat will not be realized until you can use it skillfully and with confidence.

The use of radar for obtaining bearings and ranges is discussed in Chapter 18. Most manuals that come with radar sets provide rudimentary information regarding the use of the many controls on the equipment. There are a number of books devoted to the use of radar, some focused on small craft. There are also videotapes and programs for personal computers that can be run interactively to simulate radar operation. Some larger electronic stores offer instructional courses that are well worthwhile for a skipper not experienced in radar use.

### Solid-State Radar

Solid-state, continuous-wave radar (as opposed to the traditional pulse radar) lets you see targets very close to the boat—as close as six feet from the antenna. This is a tremendous advantage in navigating where other boats may be present, in seeing smaller navigation aids, or even in a man-overboard situation. Solid-state radar uses a different technology than is used by conventional radar, employing a magnetron to generate a microwave signal transmitted from the rotating antenna; the signal changes tone or frequency when it reflects off a target and returns to the radar. Traditional radar often runs into problems with interference patterns that tend to block near-in targets. This is not the case with solid-state radar, which significantly reduces sea clutter.

The scale on a solid-state radar display is set differently. You can set the range of a solid-state radar down to one-thirty-second of a mile and display a range on the screen of only 100 feet. Solid-state technology reduces power consumption and generates lower emissions than conventional radar. Sometimes described as “broadband” radar, solid-state radar models are now offered by most or all of the marine electronics manufacturers.

Figure 16-44 This split-screen radar shows two images on very different ranges. The screen on the left shows close-in broadband radar, with a 200-foot range, displaying a boat only 100 feet away. (A solid-state radar is capable of showing an object only 6 feet from the radome.) The screen on the right, with a distant 36-mile range, still displays the nearby vessel at 0.16 nautical mile at a bearing of 348 degrees magnetic.

### FLIR

Originally developed for military uses, forward-looking infrared cameras are now used on recreational vessels to help identify objects at night or in periods of reduced visibility. They can help with navigation—letting the user identify buoys and channel markers—as well as in collision-avoidance, since other boats can be seen clearly whether they’re moving or stationary. New FLIR cameras, available in both a small handheld monocular device or through larger radar-like fixed displays, do not rely on light from an external source to develop their images. Instead, they rely on thermal energy. Everything—a boat, a person, a rock—emits heat and develops a heat signature. FLIR cameras use a microbolometer sensor that detects infrared radiation far outside the visible light spectrum. The shape of an approaching boat, for example, is displayed clearly on the screen, even in the dark of night, since its heat signature is different from the water or background surrounding it. FLIR is easy to use and has obvious safety implications, particularly in MOB applications.

### Radar Detectors

Marine radars operate at “S” and “X” band frequencies. The C.A.R.D. (Collision Avoidance Radar Detector) can be used to provide an audio and visual warning using a four-bar orthogonal display when its antenna is being illuminated by the beam from an S-band or X-band marine radar. While this is very useful, particularly when operating shorthanded, it must be remembered that no signal is returned to the vessel whose radar has “illuminated” your craft, and that skipper may be entirely unaware of your presence and location.

Figure 16-45 A FLIR handheld thermal imaging camera, which uses infrared technology to detect the heat signature of objects so they can be seen at night or in periods of reduced visibility.

Figure 16-46 Two persons overboard as seen through a FLIR thermal imaging camera, either the handheld or fixed-mount version. These cameras detect the heat radiation of each object in view, making it possible to see objects in the water—a person overboard, other boats, navigation aids—as well as bridges and other structures.

### Passive Radar Reflectors

The strength of radar echoes is based on the reflectivity of objects that return a minute portion of the outgoing radio energy from the radar set. Unfortunately, fiberglass has less reflectivity than metal and thus is a relatively poor radio wave reflector. Sails are extremely poor reflectors.

A boat owner who does not have radar equipment on board can still use radar to increase safety by installing a passive radar reflector as a desirable “defensive” device to alert radar-equipped vessels in his vicinity to his presence and position. Even radar-equipped craft should have a passive reflector mounted as high as reasonably practical. Having an operating radar on board a boat does not increase the likelihood of its being detected by other vessels unless those vessels themselves carry operative equipment that detects the presence and source of radar emissions.

Most passive radar reflectors consist of thin metal sheets arranged in mutually perpendicular planes. These may fold for storage, but must be flat and rigid with respect to each other when open for use. A reflector with each surface only about 2 feet (60 cm) square can provide a strong return signal if properly used. For maximum effectiveness, a reflector should be hoisted from three corners so that one of the eight “pockets” is straight up; this is sometimes termed the “rain-catching” position; see Figure 16-47. In certain cases, the reflector planes are held in their optimum configuration within a fiberglass shell.

Figure 16-47 Whether or not your boat is equipped with radar, it is highly advisable to use a passive radar reflector to make sure your craft shows up on the radar screen of any vessel in your vicinity that is using radar. Without such a reflector, there is a good chance your craft will not be detected by a ship’s radar.

### Racons

Racons, also referred to as radar beacons, radar transponders, and radar transponder beacons, are receiver/transmitter devices used as an aid to navigation to assist in identifying landmarks or buoys on a marine radar display. As also described in Chapter 14, a racon responds to a received radar pulse, after an extremely short delay, by transmitting back an active signal, not just a reflected echo. The returned signal becomes an identifiable mark on the radar display with a length of several miles, encoded for identification as a Morse code character. Racons are assigned various identifications consisting of single letters that are all dashes—T, M, and O. (Racons in some foreign waters may signal “D” [– · ·] on new and uncharted hazards.) The delay at the racon causes the displayed response to appear at a greater distance than the echo from the structure on which the racon is mounted. Racons and their identifying marks are normally indicated on charts.

In the United States, racons are used:

• To identify aids to navigation, both on the water (buoys) and on land (lighthouses);

• To identify landfall or positions on inconspicuous coastlines;

• To indicate navigable spans under bridges;

• To identify offshore oil platforms and similar structures.

Outside the United States, racons are also used:

• To mark new and uncharted hazards (using the letter “D”);

• To identify center and turning points.

The U.S. Coast Guard operates approximately 105 racons on the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico coasts and on the North Slope of Alaska; most of these are dual-band units responding to both X-band and S-band radars. Racons are relatively low-powered and have a range of 6 to 8 miles if located on a buoy, farther if installed at a greater height. To conserve power, those on buoys are not operated continuously, but typically with a duty cycle of 20 seconds on, 20 seconds off.

No additional equipment is required on a vessel, but some precautions are necessary in the operation of the radar. A rain clutter feature must be turned off (or, if necessary, set very low) to ensure that the racon signal is visible. U.S. Coast Guard racons are the “frequency-agile” type, responding on the exact frequency of the triggering radar; any interference rejection (IR) feature must be switched off and sea clutter suppression minimized.

## DEPTH SOUNDERS & FISHFINDERS

Depth of the water can be measured manually or electronically. A hand lead line—as described earlier in this chapter—is simple, accurate, and not subject to breakdowns, but it is awkward to use, inconvenient in bad weather, and can give only one or two readings per minute. Many boats today have an electronic depth sounder—a convenient device that gives clear and accurate measurements of the depth of water beneath the boat. A depth sounder gives readings many times each second, so frequently that they appear to be a smooth, continuous depth measurement. The depth sounder may be an independent unit mounted at the helm station or displayed as part of a multi-function data or chartplotter screen.

A depth sounder has a wide range of uses on lakes, rivers, bays, and offshore, providing both safety and convenience, so it is doubly advantageous to have on board. Now depth sounders have been carried one step further—they have evolved into fishfinders. These units do indicate the depth of the water, but go beyond that capability to show a video display of the water between the boat and the bottom, with an emphasis on indicating any fish occupying that area.

### How Depth Is Measured and Displayed

Depth sounders determine depth by measuring the roundtrip time required for pulses of ultrasonic energy to travel from the boat to the seabed and then to be reflected back to the vessel—the velocity of sound in water is about 4,800 feet/second. These are sound waves, but of a frequency above that which the human ear can hear; the ultrasonic frequencies used range from 25 kHz to 400 kHz, with 50 kHz and 200 kHz being typical. Lower frequencies will penetrate to greater depths, but higher frequencies will allow narrower beam widths and better definition of echoes in shallower water. The beam width can be as wide as 45° or as sharp as 15°; some depth sounders and fishfinders provide for the selection of a lower or a higher operating frequency. The pulses are sent out from a transducer, and the same device picks up the returning echoes and sends them to a receiver, where they are processed to eliminate undesired “noise” and are then sent to some type of display; see Figure 16-48.

Figure 16-48 An electronic depth sounder measures the distance to the bottom by the time required for pulses of ultrasonic sound to travel to the bottom and back.

Transducers are normally mounted as a through-hull fitting, but transom mounts are available for smaller craft. Careful placement of the transducer is necessary to avoid turbulence that would prevent proper operation. With all depth sounders, the center of the beam should not be greater than 15° from the vertical; if the hull angle is greater, special models are available that have the transducer fixed at an angle within the through-hull fitting. Do not shorten the cable from the transducer to the main unit; coil up any excess.

Liquid crystal displays (LCD) are commonly used in depth sounders. An LCD is a digital display that is easily read in daylight and does not require a light shield in bright-light conditions, such as in an open boat or on a flying bridge. LCDs can be backlighted for night use; red backlighting is preferable. Depth information generally is available in feet, fathoms, or meters; see Figure 16-49. There are models of “black box” depth sounders that have no display of their own and connect via cable to other electronic navigation displays or a personal computer.

Figure 16-49 Modern depth sounders display the depth digitally on an LCD screen. You can usually select feet, fathoms, or meters. Values less than 10 are usually shown to one decimal place.

A video display sounder presents a visual “elevation” picture, displaying the acoustic images of underwater objects such as fish and the seabed beneath the transducer, thus creating a fishfinder. A time history of the information captured is created as each successive set of information is added to the display. The on-screen images are based on the character of the reflected acoustic energy.

### Correction to “Zero” Depth Indication

A depth sounder’s transducer generally is mounted on the hull several feet below the water surface but (for its own protection) at some distance up from the lowest point of the keel. As depths are measured from the transducer, its readings will be neither the actual depth of the water nor the clearance between the keel and the bottom. On many models, the zero reading can be offset plus or minus a few feet so that the depth indications will be either the true water depth or the clearance under the boat, without having to mentally add or subtract a fixed amount. Although actual water-depth readings are advantageous for navigation, some skippers prefer a direct reading of clearance under the keel.

### Interpreting Displays

A depth sounder shows the depth over a small area as defined by the beam width of the transducer; it does not identify the bottom by type. Digital displays will typically show depths of 10 feet or less to a tenth of a foot, rounding to whole numbers of feet for greater depths. Some models also incorporate a seawater temperature sensor, and this value can be displayed simultaneously or alternately with depth. Other models incorporate speed data from a separate sensor. Many depth sounders have a digital output that can be sent over a data network to other navigation instruments such as a GPS receiver, radar, or a chartplotter. Portable depth sounders and even fishfinders are available that can be handheld over the side of a small boat, but their capabilities are less than those of installed units.

Figure 16-50 This stand-alone 16-inch MFD (see this page) features touchscreen and manual controls, bathymetric charts, and side-by-side wide-area and detailed fishfinder displays.

### Depth Alarms

Most depth sounders have a shallow-water alarm, and some have multiple alarms. The latter are useful when the boat is anchored. With one alarm set just below the present depth and the other set just above it, the unit sounds if the boat drags anchor toward either shallower or deeper water. Dual alarms are also useful for depth-contour piloting; set the alarms for one or two feet shallower and deeper than the depth curve you are following. An alarm should be audible from the salon or the skipper’s bunk. Some units include remote repeaters.

Figure 16-51 Some of today’s fishfinders are equipped with depth contour shading to highlight shallow water, and sophisticated transducers that allow views of what’s directly beneath and on either side of the boat.

### Fishfinders

With a fishfinder, the depth of the water is indicated, but the primary focus is on the water column between the boat and the bottom—are there any fish there? This is much like an underwater radar, either looking downward or scanning around. LCD video displays for fishfinders may be either monochrome or color, with the latter being more expensive. A digital display of depth and sometimes water temperature is shown in addition to the “picture” of the water column beneath the boat. Monochrome displays can have multiple shades of gray or green to show various features, and a white line for the bottom. Color displays use various colors for this purpose. Care must be taken when selecting a fishfinder that the screen is readable in all levels of ambient light that will be encountered.

The ability to zoom in at different ratios on a specific portion of the water column provides greater information than a simple depth sounder with only a single “elevation” display of the entire column of water beneath the boat can provide. Some fishfinders feature multiple selectable beams to view the area around the boat, and at least one such model will project a beam ahead of or behind the craft. Split screens are available on many models. There are other special features on the more expensive units, varying with the manufacturer and model. A distinct advantage of fishfinders over simple digital depth sounders is their ability to give a general indication of the nature of the bottom, such as hard rock, firm sand, or soft mud.

Fishfinders are available in a range of sizes, and one can be fitted on a fishing boat of almost any size. Display screen resolution, the ability to show fine detail, is determined by the number of picture elements (pixels) available to create the image and is more important than the overall size of the LCD.

If a fishfinder is mounted on a boat that also has a depth sounder and/or a VHF radio, care should be taken that they operate on different frequencies to avoid interference problems, especially on VHF Channel 16.

#### Scanning Fishfinders

“Scanning sonar” units are available for larger vessels and sportfishing boats. Typically, these can direct a beam of ultrasonic sound pulses 360° around a vessel or to any desired sector 6° or wider; the center of the sector can be set on dead ahead or astern, or any direction to the side. The beam can be directed from 5° upward to 90° downward to greatly expand the volume of water that is being checked. Angles of 0° to 5° down from the horizontal will show fish swimming near the surface but nothing of the bottom. Down angles of 30° to 40° will show the bottom; intermediate angles will show some of the bottom and the water area above the bottom. These are large and expensive units; the transducer dome retracts within the hull of the vessel when not in use, and speed is limited to about 15 knots when it is lowered. For smaller craft, units with a phased array of transducers (no moving parts) can scan either vertically from the surface to the bottom looking forward, or horizontally through a 90° or 180° arc centered on dead ahead, depending on the model installed; beam width is 12°.

Some fishfinders now come with two- or even three-dimensional cartography, displaying the sea bottom down to 3,000 feet with high resolution while showing underwater contours and even wrecks. Digital forward-looking sounders can be an all-weather help in navigation; they let you follow an unmarked channel, for example, to lead you to an inshore destination or keep you from running aground.

Figure 16-52 Fishfinders are available with color LCD displays that provide greater and more easily interpreted information, but these are more expensive than monochrome models. Some models can have a GPS module added so as to also show position. A “blind” fishfinder module can be connected to a chartplotter display.

## ONBOARD DATA NETWORKS & MULTI-FUNCTION DISPLAYS

One of the more interesting developments in marine electronics has been the ability to interconnect various devices for the exchange of data—and continuing advances in data and video networking can be expected in the years ahead; see Figure 16-53.

Figure 16-53 Many items of electronic equipment can be connected by a network so that information can be shared. It is advantageous, for example, for a fishfinder to also display position data and course and speed information. A radar display may share space on a chartplotter, and many other combinations are possible.

A VHF radio receives position information from a GPS receiver and adds that data to an outgoing distress message. A chartplotter receives depth information from an electronic sounder and includes that information in its display. A radar unit receives information on the vessel’s course and speed from a GPS receiver and adds that to its screen. And many instruments can be used with a second display so that the same information is available in two locations. There are also LCD display-only units that can receive inputs from various navigation devices, switching from one to another as desired. The concentration of all data in a single monitor is a great space saver on crowded helm consoles. Such devices can even be used to display the output from a TV set, VCR, VDR, or DVD player.

A multi-function display (MFD) is useful and convenient even on a large boat with ample room for navigation equipment at the helm, but it’s even more valuable on a smaller boat where there might not be enough room for an array of separate instruments. The multi-function display is a result of total system integration, offering high-speed, high-resolution images and information on large screens controlled by a combination of easy-to-use touchscreens, keypads, and rotary dials. Many new MFDs come with a chartplotter that can be split into as many as four screens simultaneously, showing, for example, a GPS navigation screen, a radar screen, a satellite weather screen, and a sonar screen.

Exchange of information among devices in a network requires the use of a standard communication protocol, a common language. The National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) established an initial standard, NMEA 0183, when the first marine data network systems became available. A “single-talker/single-listener” system, it was adequate for most installations; however, the limitations it imposed on the number of users and on data transfer speeds became unacceptable as increasing numbers of devices appeared in even small systems. A lack of strict standardization of data formats and the relatively uncontrolled development of new versions of NMEA 0183 created the need for a new, higher-speed, disciplined communication system. The NMEA met this need with NMEA 2000, a multi-talker/multi-listener system that imposes strict requirements on all users and assigns unique addresses to each device in a network. NMEA 2000 makes it possible to display instantaneous information about everything from exhaust temperature to engine oil life.

Split screens even make it possible to view both raster and vector charts next to each other; for a description of electronic charts, see Chapter 15. Raster charts display information from NOAA and British Admiralty charts that has been digitally processed; they look like the paper charts you are used to seeing, with the same scale and depth datum as the paper chart. A problem is that when you zoom in or out on a raster chart, the typography stays the same size as it was originally, often making it hard to read, although on some sets you can switch to a different chart of a harbor or smaller body of water so that you do see a clear display. A vector chart, on the other hand, has information arranged in layers that you can turn on and off. It may have aerial photographs of the harbor, for example, information about local marinas, repair services and even waterfront pizza joints. Some have three-dimensional views of the waterway ahead, or even suggest the best route to follow. Vector charts, with all their information, can be more versatile than the more traditional raster version.

Manufacturers have used NMEA standards to send data to and from electronic units for some time, but more recently they have also developed proprietary video networks based on Ethernet protocols as used for computers in offices and homes; improved connectors are used to meet marine conditions. The various devices are connected to a hub as in small businesses and homes with several computers. Most Ethernet systems use standard RJ 45 connectors; however, waterproof connector housings may be used in place of the hardware commonly used in an office environment. Proprietary networks usually have a trademark name. They are quite satisfactory in use, but may require all devices to come from one manufacturer. Networks can start small, with only a few devices, and grow as new ones are added.

Figure 16-55 Twin MFDs recessed into this helm console are protected from the elements and offer at-a-glance updates on position and safety.

## AUTOPILOTS

Autopilots are becoming more and more common on small craft because they offer two considerable operational advantages and at least one safety advantage. But first, what is an autopilot? It is an electronic device using mechanical or hydraulic power to steer a boat (or ship). The name is somewhat unfortunate as the equipment does not perform any true “piloting” functions, such as determining position or deciding what course to steer to a destination. A better name might be an “automatic helmsman.” An autopilot is basically a device that will ensure that a boat is maintained on a preset heading. More advanced models can receive positional information and adjust that heading to make good a desired track. An autopilot can be an important adjunct to the navigator’s tools—especially on a shorthanded boat—and thus autopilots are included in this chapter.

The operational advantages are: (1) the person at the helm is relieved of the job of constantly steering the boat, which can be tiresome and tedious (and cold, wet, and uncomfortable at times on some craft); and (2) the autopilot will in many, if not most, cases do a better job than a human for maintaining a desired heading! The safety advantage is that the person at the helm will have much more time to act as a lookout for other vessels and hazards to navigation.

The heading sensor is usually an electronic compass of the fluxgate type, which should be installed in a stable location (usually low in the hull) and well away from varying magnetic influences (steady influences can be compensated out by the autopilot’s computer). Data from this unit is sent to the central processor, which can be located anywhere that is convenient. From this electronic “brain,” signals are sent to a mechanical or hydraulic drive unit to turn the rudder(s) in a direction that will correct a heading error. To make control more effective and smoother, a rudder angle sensor will provide “feedback” to the control unit.

Sailboats may use a masthead wind vane to maintain a steady heading with respect to the apparent wind, and may be able to automatically take up a new heading that is 100° (or other preset value) greater or lesser following a tacking maneuver. Advanced models can “learn” the handling characteristics of the boat and its reaction to wind, currents, and waves.

The input power requirements are moderate and usually no problem. The convenience of having an autopilot will be appreciated by all who stand a watch at the helm. Although sometimes it will be necessary for a human to steer—in a significant following or quartering sea, for example—you will be amazed and satisfied as to the large percentage of the time that an autopilot can steer your craft.

As noted above, many autopilots will accept positional information in the form of cross-track error from a GPS receiver. This will alter the desired heading to compensate for offsetting influences such as currents or crosswinds. A dodge feature will allow the preset heading to be overridden temporarily to avoid an obstruction in the waters ahead; the prior heading will be resumed when the dodging action has ended. A handheld remote, wired or wireless, makes it possible to control the autopilot when away from the helm.

Various alarms are included in many autopilots. An off-course alarm will sound if the vessel gets more than a preselected distance from the established track. A watch alarm can be set to sound an audible signal at regular intervals until manually turned off—no more sleeping undisturbed at the helm! Some autopilots can be used in a power-steering mode without the heading sensor being active.

Figure 16-56 Despite the suite of navigation electronics integrated on the helm console of this power cruiser, the ship’s compass (partially obscured by helm) retains its central location.

# CHAPTER17

Figure 17-01 The rise and fall of ocean tidal levels cause a flow first into and then out of inland bodies of water such as bays, sounds, and the lower reaches of rivers. Because they can set a boat off its course, these tidal currents have important effects in piloting.

TIDES & CURRENTS

The Nature of Tides & Their Causes • Tidal Predictions & Calculations Currents & Their Prediction • The Effects of Currents on Piloting

An understanding of tides and currents is important to a skipper in coastal waters, as these can to some extent affect where he or she can travel or anchor safely, how long it will take to get there—or the speed that will be needed to arrive at a given time—and the heading that must be maintained to make good a given course over the bottom.

Here we should reemphasize the proper meaning and use of some terms that often are used incorrectly. Tide is the rise and fall of the ocean level as a result of changes in the gravitational attraction between earth, moon, and sun. It is a vertical motion only. Current is the horizontal motion of water from any cause. Tidal current is the flow of water from one point to another that results from a difference in tidal heights at those points. To say “The tide certainly is running strongly today!” is not correct, for tides may be high or low, but they do not “run.” The correct expression would be “The tidal current certainly is strong today.” Remember—tide is vertical change; current is horizontal flow.

## TIDES

Tides originate in the open oceans and seas, but are only noticeable and significant close to shore. The effects of tides will be observed along coastal beaches, in bays and sounds, and up rivers generally as far as the first rapids, waterfall, or dam. Curiously, the rise and fall of tides may be more noticeable a hundred miles up a river than at the river’s mouth, because water piles up higher in the river’s narrower stretches. Coastal regions in which the water levels are subject to tidal action are commonly referred to as “tidewater” areas.

#### Definition of Terms

In addition to the basic definition of tide as given above, certain other terms used in connection with tidal action must be defined. The height of tide at any specified time is the vertical measurement between the surface of the water and the tidal datum, or reference plane, typically at what is called mean lower low water; see this page. Do not confuse “height of tide” with “depth of water.” The latter is the total distance from the surface to the bottom. The tidal datum for an area is selected so that the heights of tide are normally positive values, but the height can at times be a small negative number when the water level falls below the datum.

High water, or high tide, is the highest level reached by an ascending tide; see Figure 17-02. Correspondingly, low water, or low tide, is the lowest level reached by a descending tide. The difference between high and low waters is the range of the tide.

Figure 17-02 Mean lower low water is the reference level for all NOS tide levels. Bridge clearances are measured from mean high water. Tidal range is the difference between a given high water and the adjacent low water. Mean range of tide is the difference between mean low water and mean high water.

The change in tidal level does not occur at a uniform rate; starting from low water, the level builds up slowly, then at an increasing rate which in turn tapers off as high water is reached. The decrease in tidal stage from high water to low follows a corresponding pattern of a slow buildup to a maximum rate roughly midway between stages, followed by a decreasing rate. At both high and low tides, there will be periods of relatively no change in level; these are termed stand, as in the high-water stand and the low-water stand. Mean sea level is the average level of the open ocean, and corresponds closely to mid-tide levels offshore; it is not used in navigation.

### Tidal Theory

Tidal theory involves the interaction of gravitational and centrifugal forces—the inward attractions of the earth on one hand and the sun and the moon on the other, balanced by the outward forces resulting from the revolution of the earth in its orbit; see Figure 17-03. The gravitational and centrifugal forces are in balance as a whole—otherwise the bodies would fly apart from each other or else crash together—but they are not quite in balance at most points on the earth’s surface, and this is what causes the tides. The effects of the sun and moon will be described separately, even though, of course, they act simultaneously.

Figure 17-03 Tides result from the differences between centrifugal and gravitational forces. The forces illustrated here represent the interaction of the earth and sun; corresponding forces result from the relationship of the moon and the earth.

#### Earth-Sun Effects

Although not precisely the case, the earth can be thought of as revolving around the sun, and just as a stone tied to the end of a string tends to sail off when a young boy whirls it about his head, so the earth tends to fly off into space. This effect is known as centrifugal force; it is shown at the left in Figure 17-03. (Remember that we are talking about the centrifugal force related to the sun-earth system, and not that of the spinning of the earth on its own axis.)

The earth is kept from flying off into space by the gravitational attraction of the sun, shown at the right in Figure 17-03. These forces are in overall balance.

This balance of forces is not exact at all points. The sun-earth centrifugal force acts opposite to the direction toward the sun; since centrifugal force increases with the radius of rotation, it is greatest on the side of the earth that is away from the sun. Gravitational forces increase as the distance between objects decreases, therefore the gravitational force acting toward the sun is greatest on the side of the earth that is closest to the sun. Figure 17-03 shows these forces.

In theory, we can think of the earth as being a smooth sphere uniformly covered with water (no land areas). Figure 17-04 shows how the resultant forces cause the water to flow toward the areas of the earth’s surface that are both nearest and farthest from the sun; here there will be “high tides.” As this water flows, the areas from which it comes will have less water, and hence low tides. (The tides on the side of the earth nearer the sun are slightly greater than those on the far side, but the difference is not great—only about 5 percent.)

Figure 17-04 In a theoretical simplification, high tides are created on opposite sides of the earth at the same time. The gravitational attraction of the sun (or moon) pulls one way and the centrifugal force of the earth’s orbit pulls the other way.

As the earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, the line of direction to the sun constantly changes. Thus each point of the earth’s surface will have two high and two low tides each day. As a result of the tilt of the earth’s axis, the pairs of highs, and those of the lows, will not normally be of exactly the same level.

#### Earth-Moon Effects

The moon is commonly thought of as revolving about the earth; actually, the two bodies revolve around a common point on a monthly cycle. This point is located about 2,900 miles (4,667 km) from the center of the earth toward the moon (about 1,100 miles or 1,770 km deep inside the earth). Both tend to fly away from this common point (centrifugal force), but the mutual gravitational attraction acts as a counterbalance and they remain the same distance apart. However, the gravitational pull of the moon affects the waters of the earth in the same manner as the pull of the sun.

#### Spring & Neap Tides

Now combine the earth-sun and the earth-moon systems. Although the mass of the moon is only a tiny fraction of that of the sun, it is much closer to the earth (about 238,860 miles or 384,400 km away). Thus its tidal forces are roughly 2½ times greater than those of the sun (about 92,900,000 miles or 149,500,000 km away). The result is that the observed tide usually “follows the moon,” but the action is somewhat modified by the sun’s relative position. The two high and two low waters each day occur about 50 minutes later than the corresponding tides of the previous day.

In the course of any one lunar month, the three bodies line up in sun-moon-earth and sun-earth-moon relationships; see Figure 17-05. These are the times of the new and full moon, respectively. In both cases, the sun’s effect lines up with and reinforces the moon’s effect, tending to result in greater than average tidal ranges (usually about 20 percent) called spring tides; note that this name has nothing to do with the season of the year.

Figure 17-05 At new and full moons, the combined gravitational pull of the sun and the moon produces the largest tidal variations. These tides, which occur twice a month, are called spring tides. At the first and third quarters of the moon, the two gravitational forces partially offset each other and the net tidal effect is less; these tides are called neap tides.

At other positions in Figure 17-05, when the moon is at its first and third quarters, the tidal “bulge” caused by the sun is at right angles to that caused by the moon (they are said to be “in quadrature”). The two tidal effects are in conflict and partially cancel each other, resulting in smaller-than-average ranges (again about 20 percent); these are neap tides.

Note that the tidal range of any given point varies from month to month, and from year to year. The monthly variation results from the fact that the earth is not at the center of the moon’s orbit. When the moon is closest to the earth (at perigee), the lunar influence is maximum and tides will have the greatest ranges. Conversely, when the moon is farthest from the earth (at apogee), its effect and tidal ranges are least.

In a similar manner, the yearly variations in the daily ranges of the tides are caused by the changing gravitational effects of the sun as the body’s distance from the earth becomes greater or less.

### Actual Tides

The tide that we observe often seems to be at odds with the theoretical forces that govern it. Here are the main reasons for this:

• Great masses of land, the continents, irregularly shaped and irregularly placed, act to interrupt, restrict, and reflect tidal movements.

• Water, although generally appearing to flow freely, is actually a somewhat viscous substance that lags in its response to tidal forces.

• Friction is present as the ocean waters “rub” against the ocean bottom.

• The depth to the bottom of the sea, varying widely, influences the speed of the horizontal tidal motion.

• The depths of the ocean areas and the restrictions of the continents often result in “basins” that have their own way of responding to tidal forces.

Although these reasons account for great differences between theoretical and observed tides, there nevertheless remain definite, constant relationships between the two at any particular location. By observing the tide and relating these observations to the movements of the sun, moon, and earth, these constant relationships can be determined. With this information, tides can be predicted for any future date at a given place.

#### Types of Tides

A tide that each day has two high waters approximately equal in height, and two low waters also about equal, is known as a semidiurnal tide. This is the most common tide, and, in the United States, occurs along the East Coast; see Figure 17-06, left.

Figure 17-06 The daily cycle of tides (a 24-hour period is shown in blue) varies widely from place to place. There are three basic types—semidiurnal (left), mixed (center), and diurnal (right).

In a monthly cycle, the moon moves north and south of the equator; the importance of this action to tides is illustrated in Figure 17-07. Point A is under a bulge in the envelope. A half day later, at point B, it is again under the bulge but the height is not as large as A. This situation, combined with coastal characteristics, tends to give rise to a “twice daily” tide with unequal high and/or low waters in some areas. This is known as the mixed type of tide; refer to Figure 17-06, center. The term “low water” may be modified to indicate the more pronounced of the two lows. This tidal stage is termed lower low water and is averaged over a complete tidal cycle of approximately 19 years to determine the mean lower low water (MLLW), which is used as the tidal datum in many areas; refer to Figure 17-02. Likewise, the more significant of the higher tides is termed higher high water.

Figure 17-07 As the moon travels north and south of the earth’s equatorial plane, it causes variations in the daily cycle at any given location on earth. Similar but smaller effects result from the sun’s change in position with respect to the equator.

Now consider point C in Figure 17-07. At this place, it is still under the bulge of the envelope. Point D, however, which is at the same latitude as point C, it is above the low part. Point C will reach the orientation of point D after one half day of the earth’s rotation. Hence the tidal forces tend to cause only one high and one low water each day (actually each 24 hours and 50 minutes approximately). This is the diurnal type, typified by Pensacola, Florida; refer to Figure 17-06, right.

Whenever the moon is farthest north (as in Figure 17-07) or south, there will be a tendency to have the diurnal or mixed type. When the moon lies over the equator, we tend to have the semidiurnal type. These are equatorial tides, and the tendency toward producing inequality is then at a minimum.

These theoretical considerations are modified, however, by many practical factors such as the general configuration of the coastline.

#### Special Tide Situations

Peculiarities in the tide can be found almost everywhere, but none compare with those in the Bay of Fundy of eastern North America. Twice each day, the waters surge in and out of the Bay producing, at Burntcoat Head, the highest tidal range in the world, a typical rise and fall of nearly 44 feet (13.4 meters). At normal spring tides, it rises 51.5 feet (15.7 m), and on perigee springs, as much as 53 feet or 16.2 meters.

The great range is often attributed to the funnel-like shape of the bay, but this is not the main cause. Just as the water in a washbasin will slosh when you move your hand back and forth in just the right period of time, depending upon the depth of the water and the shape of the basin, so the tide will attempt to oscillate water in bays in cycles of 12 hours and 25 minutes. It would be a coincidence, indeed, if a bay were of such a shape and depth as to have a complete oscillation with a period of exactly 12 hours and 25 minutes. A bay can easily have a part of such an oscillation, however, and such is the case in the Bay of Fundy.

A further factor in the large tidal ranges in the Bay of Fundy is that they are significantly affected by the Gulf of Maine tides, which, in turn, are affected by the open ocean tides. The relationships between these tides are such as to exaggerate their ranges.

#### Reference Planes

As mentioned, the heights of tides are reckoned from the specific reference plane, or datum. Although in the past, different datums were used on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific Coasts of the United States, for all areas the predictions and charts of the National Ocean Service (NOS) are now based on a datum of mean lower low water.

### The Importance of lides

A good knowledge of tidal action is essential for safe navigation. The skipper of a boat of any size will be faced many times with the need to know the times of high water and low water and their probable heights. He may want to cross some shoal area, passable at certain tidal stages but not at others. He may be about to anchor, and the scope to pay out will be affected by the tide’s range. He may be going to make fast to a pier or wharf in a strange harbor and needs to know about the tides to adjust his lines properly for the night.

### Tide Tables

The basic source of information on the times of high and low water and their heights above (or below) the datum are the tide tables prepared by the National Ocean Service. NOS no longer prints these tables for sale to the public, but rather provides the data to several commercial contractors who do the printing in book format annually in four volumes, one of which covers the East Coast of North and South America, and another the West Coast of these continents; refer to Chapter 15, Figure 15-38. The printed Tide Tables can usually be bought at any authorized sales agent for NOS charts or a nautical bookstore. The NOS tide data are also used by companies that prepare programs of tidal information for personal computers and other electronic devices.

For information on predictions, contact NOAA/National Ocean Services, CO-OPS, 1305 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910-3281; phone 301-713-2815; fax 301-713-4500; or visit http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov. From this URL you can access tide predictions for any station. You can download for viewing or saving the annual predictions for the station of interest in the format shown in Figures 17-08, 17-09, and 17-11, or you can select the day or days of particular interest.

Any predictions appearing in newspapers or broadcast over radio and TV stations will have been extracted from these tables. Small-craft charts may include tidal information in their margins or on the cover jacket, if one is used; see Figure 17-08.

Figure 17-08 Small-craft charts provide annual tidal predictions for reference stations covered by the chart. Information tabulated for marinas and other boating facilities includes data on the mean tidal range and the time difference from the applicable reference station.

The Tide Tables give the predicted times and heights of high and low water for each day of the year at important points known as reference stations. Portland, Boston, Sandy Hook, and Key West are examples of points for which detailed information is given in the East Coast Tide Tables. Reference stations in the West Coast Tide Tables include San Diego, the Golden Gate at San Francisco, and Aberdeen, Washington.

Additional data show the difference in times and heights between these reference stations and thousands of other points termed subordinate stations. From these tables, the tide at virtually any point of significance along the coasts can easily be computed. The West Coast Tide Tables, for example, contain predictions for 40 reference stations and differences for about 1,100 subordinate stations in North and South America.

Other nations have similar sets of tables for their waters.

#### Cautions

All factors that can be determined in advance are taken into account in tide predictions, but remember when using them that other factors can also influence the height of tides greatly. Such influences include barometric pressure and wind. In many areas the effect of a prolonged gale from a certain quarter can offset all other factors. Tidal rivers may be affected by the volume of water flowing down from the watershed. Normal seasonal variations of flow are allowed for in the predictions, but unexpected prolonged wet or dry spells may cause significant changes to tidal height predictions. Intense rainfall upriver may change both heights and times of tides, and such effects may not appear downstream for several days.

You should therefore be careful whenever using the Tide Tables, especially since low waters can go considerably lower than the level predicted.

#### Explanation of the Tide Tables

Table 1 of the Tide Tables gives the predicted times and heights of high and low water at the main reference stations and is self-explanatory; note that heights are given in both feet and meters or centimeters; see Figures 17-09, 17-10, and 17-11. Where no sign is given before the predicted height, the quantity is positive and is to be added to the depths as given on the chart. When the value is preceded by a minus (−) sign, the “heights” are to be subtracted from charted depths.

Figure 17-09 Each reference station is given four pages in Table 1, and each page covers three months. Tide levels are shown in feet and centimeters. The days of new and full moons are also indicated.

Figure 17-10 This Table 1 extract shows how a high or low tide may be omitted near midnight (see text); this might occur about once every two weeks.

Figure 17-11 This is an extract from Table 1; it is used for working the examples of tide-level calculations on this page.

Time is given in the four-digit system from 0001 to 2400 (see this page). In many areas you must be careful regarding daylight time (DT). The Tide Tables may be published in local standard or daylight time, and a correction may be required. Tide predictions at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov are corrected for daylight time if you choose the default setting, but you can, as an option, choose standard time instead.

When there are normally two high and two low tides each date, they are roughly a little less than an hour later each succeeding day. Consequently, a high or low tide may skip a calendar day, as indicated by a blank space in the Tide Tables; see Figure 17-10. If it is a low tide that is skipped, for example, you will note that the previous corresponding low occurred late in the foregoing day, and the next one will occur early in the following day; see the sequence for late nighttime high tides on the 16th, 17th, and 18th in Figure 17-10; and refer to Figure 17-06, center.

Note also from a review of the Tide Tables that at some places there will be only one high and one low tide on some days, with the usual four tides on other days. This is not a diurnal tide situation, where a single high and low would occur every day. The condition considered here arises when the configuration of the land and the periods between successive tides are such that one tide is reflected back from the shore and alters the effect of the succeeding tide.

Sometimes the difference in the height of the two high or two low waters of a day is so increased as to cause only one low water each day. These tides are not unusual in the tropics and consequently are called tropic tides.

Table 2, Tidal Differences and Other Constants, gives the information necessary to find the time and height of tide for thousands of subordinate stations by applying simple corrections to the data given for the main reference stations; see Figures 17-12 and 17-13. The name of the applicable reference stations appears at the head of the particular section in which the subordinate station is listed. After the subordinate station number and name, the following information is given in the columns of Table 2:

1. Latitude and longitude of the subordinate station.

2. Differences in time and height of high (and low) waters at the subordinate station and its designated reference station.

3. Mean and spring (or diurnal) tidal ranges.

4. Mean tide level.

Figure 17-12 This is an extract from Table 2 to be used in working the text examples. Note that the differences are to be applied to the Seattle reference station as indicated in the fourth column. Asterisks (*) indicate ratios. The height at the reference station is multiplied by this figure; see text.

Figure 17-13 Another extract from Table 2 used in working the tide-level examples in the text. Seattle is again the reference station.

As mentioned, note that the existence of a “minus tide” means that the actual depths of water will be less than the figures on the chart.

To determine the time of high or low water at any station in Table 2, use the column marked “Differences, Time.” This gives the hours and minutes to be added to (+) or subtracted from (−) the time of the respective high or low water at the reference station shown in boldface type above the listing of the subordinate station. Be careful in making calculations near midnight. Applying the time difference may cause you to cross the line from one day to another. Simply add or subtract 24 hours as necessary.

The height of the tide at a station in Table 2 is determined by applying the height difference, or in some cases the ratio. A plus sign (+) indicates that the difference increases the height given for the designated reference station; a minus sign (−) indicates that it decreases the Table 1 value. Differences are not given in metric values; if needed, conversions from feet can be made using Table 7 in the Tide Tables; see also Appendix D.

Where height differences would give unsatisfactory predictions, ratios may be substituted for heights. Ratios are identified by an asterisk, and are given as a decimal fraction by which the height at the reference station is to be multiplied to determine the height at the subordinate station.

Note that when you access tide predictions at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov for a particular day or few days of interest at a subordinate station, the Table 2 corrections are applied for you, and the corrected data are ready for use. Annual predictions for a subordinate station are given in the traditional uncorrected format, however, and Table 2 corrections must be applied.

In the Table 2 columns headed “Ranges,” the mean range is the difference in height between mean high water (MHW) and mean low water (MLW). This figure is useful in many areas where it may be added to mean low water to get mean high water, the datum commonly used for measuring vertical heights above water for bridge and other vertical clearances. The spring range is the average semidiurnal range occurring twice monthly when the moon is new or full. It is larger than the mean range where the type of tide is either semidiurnal or mixed, and is of no practical significance where the tide is of the diurnal type. Where this is the situation, the tables give the diurnal range, which is the difference in height between mean higher high water and mean lower low water.

Special conditions at certain subordinate stations are covered by endnotes following Table 2. The format may vary slightly with different commercial publishers.

Table 3, Height of Tide at Any Time, is provided in order that detailed calculations can be made for the height of the tide at any desired moment between the times of high and low waters; see Figure 17-14. It is equally usable for either the reference stations in Table 1 or the subordinate stations of Table 2. Note that Table 3 is not a complete set of variation from one low to one high. Since the rise and fall are assumed to be symmetrical, only a half table need be printed. Calculations are made from a high or low water, whichever is nearer to the specified time. In using Table 3, the nearest tabular values are used; interpolation is not necessary.

Figure 17-14 Table 3 is used to determine the height of the tide at intermediate times between high and low water. To use this table, you must know three things—how long in hours and minutes between the high and low on either side of the time in which you are interested; the time in hours and minutes from that time to the nearer of the adjacent high and low; and the size of the rise or fall to the nearest half foot. The answer produced from that data and Table 3 will give you a correction value to be applied to that high or low prediction.

If the degree of precision of Table 3 is not required (it seldom is in practical piloting situations), a much simpler and quicker estimation can be made by using the following “one-two-three” rule of thumb. The tide may be assumed to rise or fall 1/12 of the full range during the first and sixth hours after high and low water stands, 2/12 during the second and fifth hours, and 3/12 during the third and fourth hours. The results obtained by this rule will suffice for essentially all situations and locations, but should be compared with Table 3 calculations as a check when entering new areas.

Other Tables. The Tide Tables also include four other minor tables that, although not directly related to tidal calculations, are often useful. Table 4 provides sunrise and sunset data at five-day intervals for various latitudes. Table 5 lists corrections to convert the local mean times of Table 4 to standard zone time. Table 6 tabulates times of moonrise and moonset for certain selected locations. Table 7, as noted on this page, allows direct conversion of feet to meters. The inside back cover of the publication lists other useful data such as the phases of the moon, solar equinoxes, and solstices.

Table 1 through Table 6 are each preceded by informative material that should be read carefully prior to use of the table concerned.

#### Tidal Effects on Vertical Clearances

The tide’s rise and fall changes the vertical clearance under fixed structures such as bridges or overhead power cables. These clearances are stated on charts and in Coast Pilots as heights measured from a datum that is not the same plane as used for depths and tidal predictions. The datum for heights is normally mean high water, the average of all high water levels. The use of this datum ensures that clearances and heights are normally (though not always) greater than charted or Coast Pilot values.

It will thus be necessary to determine the height of MHW above the tidal datum. Since the tidal datum is mean lower low water, the plane of mean high water is above MLLW by an amount equal to the sum of the “mean tide level” plus one-half of the “mean range”; both of these values are listed in Table 2 of the Tide Tables for all stations; also refer to Figure 17-02.

If the tide level at any given moment is below MHW, the vertical clearance under a bridge or other fixed structure is then greater than the figures shown on the chart; but if the tide height is above the level of MHW, the clearance is less. You should calculate the vertical clearance in advance if you anticipate a tight situation, but also observe the clearance gauges usually found at bridges. Clearances will normally be greater than the charted MHW values, but will occasionally be less.

### Examples of Tidal Calculations

The instructions in the Tide Tables should be fully adequate for solving any problem. However, Tide-Level Examples 1 through 6 are worked here for various situations as guides to the use of various individual tables. Comments and cautions relating to the solution of practical problems involving the Tide Tables will also be given. The extracts from the Tide Tables that are necessary to work the Tide-Level Examples are given in Figures 17-11 through 17-14.

##### TIDE-LEVEL EXAMPLE 1

Determining the time and height of a high or low tide at a Reference Station.

Problem: What is the predicted time and height of the evening low tide at Seattle, Washington, on Monday 13 December?

Solution: Refer to the Table 1, excerpt in Figure 17-11, taken from the Tide Tables. Note that the entry for 13 December shows that the evening low water is predicted to occur at 2246 Pacific Standard Time (PST) and that the height will be -2.9 feet, or 2.9 feet below the tidal datum of MLLW. Actual depths will then be lower than the charted depths.

On the same date, morning low tide is 7.3 feet above the tidal datum of MLLW.

Note that on Wednesday 15 December, there is no evening low because the progression of the tides on a 24 hour and 50 minute cycle has moved the evening low tide past midnight into the next day. As a result, the table shows only three entries for Wednesday 15 December rather than the usual four.

## CURRENTS

current is the horizontal motion of water. It may result from any one of several factors, or from a combination of two or more. Although certain of these causes are more important to a boater than others are, he or she should have a general understanding of all.

### Types of Currents

The major causes of current flow are gravitational action, the flow of air (wind) across the surface of bodies of water, and geophysical differences such as variations in heat and salt. Water naturally flows “downhill” as in rivers or from higher tidal levels to lower ones. Persistent winds across large bodies of water cause a surface flow. Currents over large areas in oceans may be either seasonal or semipermanent.

##### TIDE-LEVEL EXAMPLE 2

Determining the time and height of a high or low tide at a Subordinate Station.

Problem: What is the predicted time and height of the morning low water at Yokeko Point, Deception Pass, on Saturday 13 November?

Solution: The Index to Table 2 in the Tide Tables shows Yokeko Point as Subordinate Station number 1147. Locate Yokeko Point in Table 2 and note the time and height differences for low waters; be sure to use the correct columns. Apply the difference to the time and height of low tide at the Reference Station as follows:

Time

 

Height

09 53

at Seattle

5.9

+0:38

difference

-0.2

10 31

at Yokeko Point

5.7

Thus at Yokeko Point, on 13 November, the predicted morning low will occur at 1031 PST with a height of 5.7 feet above tidal datum.

Note: If the example had been November 30, the morning low water at Seattle for that date is at 1140. Adding the time difference of 0h 38m would have resulted in a time prediction at Yokeko Point of 1218, which is not a morning tide. In such cases, use the reference station low water that occurs before midnight the preceding day.

#### Tidal Currents

Boaters in coastal areas will be affected most by tidal currents. The rise and fall of tidal levels is a result of the flow of water to and from a given locality. Such flow of water results in tidal current effects.

The normal type of tidal current, in bays and rivers, is called the reversing current that flows alternately in one direction and then in the opposite. Off shore, tidal currents may be of the rotary type, flowing with little change in strength, but while slowly and steadily changing direction.

A special form of a tidal current is known as the hydraulic type, such as flows in a waterway connecting two bodies of water. Differences in the time and height of the high and low waters of the two bays, sounds, or other tidal waters cause a flow from one to the other and back again. A typical example of hydraulic current is the flow through the Cape Cod Canal between Massachusetts Bay and Buzzards Bay.

Remember to use the terms correctly—tide is the vertical rise and fall of water levels; current is the horizontal flow of water.

##### TIDE-LEVEL EXAMPLE 3

Determining the level of the tide at a reference station at a given time between high and low waters.

Problem: What is the predicted height of the tide at Seattle at 1700 on Sunday 28 November?

Solution: From Table 1, note that the given time of 1700 falls between a high tide at 1505 and a low tide at 2223. We compute the duration of fall and range as follows:

Time

Height

15 05

10.5

22 23

-1.1

7:18 duration of fall

11.6 feet range

The desired time is nearer to the time of high water, so calculations will be made using this starting point.

1700

desired time

1505

time of nearest high water

1:55

difference

The given time is 1 h 55m after the nearest high water. Turn to Table 3, which is used to the nearest tabulated value; do not interpolate. Enter the upper part of the table on the line for duration of rise or fall of 7 h 20m (nearest value to 7h 18m) and read across to the entry nearest 1h 55m—in this case 1h 57m in the eighth column from the left. Follow down this column into the lower part of Table 3 to the line for range of tide of 11.5 feet (nearest value to 11.6). At the intersection of this line and column is found the correction to the height of the tide: 1.9 feet.

Since, as we have noted, the tide is falling, and we are calculating from high water, the correction is subtracted from the height of high water:

10.5 − 1.9 = 8.6 feet.

Thus, the predicted height of the tide at Seattle at 1700 PST on Sunday 28 November is 8.6 feet above the tidal datum.

Make sure that calculations are made for the right pair of high and low tides—and that the calculations are made to the nearest high or low water. Also, be careful to apply the final correction to the nearest high or low water as used in the computation. Do not apply it to the range. Apply it in the right direction: down from a high or up from a low.

##### TIDE-LEVEL EXAMPLE 4

Determining the predicted height of tide at a Subordinate Station at a given time.

Problem: What is the predicted height of the tide at Shelton, Oakland Bay, Puget Sound, at 2000 on Saturday 30 October?

Solution: First, use the steps from Tide-Level Example 2—find Shelton in the index, locate its number on Table 2 and note the time and height differences. Now, the times of the high and low waters on either side of the stated time must be calculated for the subordinate station using Tables 1 and 2. This is done as follows:

High-water time

Height

15 51 at Seattle

10.4 feet

+ 1:26 difference

1.26 ratio

17 17 at Shelton

13.1 feet

Low-water time

Height

22 48 at Seattle

-0.4

+2:05 difference

0.92 ratio

00 53 at Shelton

-0.37 (-0.4)

Next we calculate the time difference and range:

Time

Range

00 53 low water

-0.4

17 17 high water

13.1

7:36  time difference

13.5 feet range

The time from the nearest high or low is calculated:

17 17 high water at Shelton

20 00 desired time

2:43 time from nearest high

With the data from the above calculations, enter Table 3 for a duration of rise or fall of 7h 40m (nearest to 7h 36m), a time from nearest high or low of 2 h 49m (nearest to 2h 43m), and a range of 13.5 feet.

From these data, we find a correction to height of tide of 4.0 feet. We know that the tide is falling and therefore the height at 2000 will be less than the height at the closest high water at 1717. Therefore, the correction is to be subtracted from the Shelton high water height: 13.1 − 4.0 = 9.1 feet. The height of the tide at Shelton, Oakland Bay, Puget Sound, at 2000 on Saturday 30 October is predicted to be 9.1 feet above datum.

Note: If the times for 30 October in Table 1 are in PST, you’ll have to add an hour for daylight savings time. Also, you must be sure to use the high and low tides occurring at the Subordinate Station on either side of the given time. In some instances, you may find that when you have corrected the times for the subordinate station, the desired time no longer falls between the corrected times of high and low tides. In this case, select another high or low tide so that the pair used at the subordinate station will bracket the given time.

##### TIDE-LEVEL EXAMPLE 5

Determining the time of the tide reaching a given height at a Reference Station.

Problem: At what time on the morning of Tuesday 30 November will the height of the rising tide at Seattle reach 3 feet?

Solution: This is essentially Tide-Level Example 3 in reverse. First determine the range and duration of the rise (or fall) as follows:

Time

Height

22 56 (29th low water)

-1.4 feet

06 25 high water

12.0 feet

7:29 duration/range

13.4 feet range

It is noted that the desired difference in height of tide is from the low water −1.4 −3 = −4.4 or 4.4 feet.

Enter the lower part of Table 3 on the line for a range of 13.5 feet (nearest to actual 13.4 feet) and find the column in which the correction nearest 4.4 is tabulated: in this case, the nearest value (4.7) is found on the 12th column to the right.

Proceed up this column to the line in the upper part of the table for a duration of 7h 20m (nearest to the actual 7h 29m). The time from the nearest high or low found on this line is 2h 56m. Since our desired level is nearest to low water than high, this time difference is added to the time of low water: 2256 + 2:56 = 0152.

Thus the desired tidal height of 3 feet above datum is predicted to occur at 0152 PST on 30 November.

Note: a similar calculation can be made for a subordinate station by first determining the applicable high and low water times and heights at that station.

##### TIDE-LEVEL EXAMPLE 6

Determination of predicted vertical clearance.

Problem: What will be the predicted vertical clearance under the fixed bridge across the canal near Ala Spit, Whidbey Island, at the time of morning high tide on 13 December?

Solution: Chart 18445 states the clearance to be 35 feet. The datum for heights is MHW.

From Tables 1 and 2, we determine the predicted height of the tide at the specified time as follows:

At Seattle

12.7 feet

Ratio

0.92

At Ala Spit

11.68 (11.7)

From Table 2 we calculate the height of mean high water for Ala Spit.

Mean tide level

6.1 feet

½ mean range

3.5

Mean high water

9.6 feet above tidal datum

The difference between predicted high water at the specified time and mean high water is 11.7 − 9.6 = 2.1 This is above MHW and the bridge clearance is reduced; 35 − 2.1 = 33 feet, to the nearest whole foot.

On the morning of 13 December, the clearance at high tide under the fixed bridge across the canal near Ala Spit, Whidbey Island, is predicted to be 33 feet. This is less than the clearance printed on the chart.

#### River Currents

Boaters on rivers above the head of tidal action must take into account river currents. (Where tidal influences are felt, river currents are merged into tidal currents and are not considered separately.) River currents vary considerably with the width and depth of the stream, the season, and recent rainfall; refer to Chapter 22 for details. When rivers reach tidal areas, the currents there will be a combination of river flow and tidal level changes.

#### Ocean Currents

Offshore piloting will frequently require knowledge and consideration of ocean currents. These currents result from relatively constant winds such as the trade winds and prevailing westerlies. The rotation of the earth and variations in water density and salinity are also factors in the patterns of ocean currents.

The ocean currents of greatest interest to American boaters are the Gulf Stream and the California Current; see Figure 17-15. The Gulf Stream is a northerly and easterly flow of warm water along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. It is quite close to shore along the southern part of Florida, but moves progressively farther to sea as it flows northward, where it both broadens and slows.

Figure 17-15 Shown here are the major ocean surface currents of the world. The Gulf Stream off the East Coast of the United States and Canada and the California Current off the West Coast are those of most interest to North American boaters. Other currents exist at lower depths, as well as downwelling and upwelling.

The California Current flows generally southward and a bit eastward along the Pacific Coast of Canada and the United States, turning sharply westward of Baja California (Mexico). It is a flow of colder water and, in general, is slower and less sharply defined than the Gulf Stream, and exhibits some variation with season.

#### Wind-Driven Currents

In addition to the consistent ocean currents caused by sustained wind patterns, temporary conditions may create local wind-driven currents. Wind blowing across the sea causes the surface water to move. The extent of this effect varies, but generally a steady wind for 12 hours or longer will result in a discernible current.

For a rough rule of thumb, the strength of a wind-driven current can be taken as 2 percent of the wind’s velocity. The direction of the current will not be the same as that of the wind, if the flow is north or south, making it subject to deflection by the Coriolis force (to the right in the Northern Hemisphere) created by the earth’s rotation. The magnitude of the deflection is greatest at high latitudes and also depends on the depth of the water. Currents that set directly east or west are not affected by the Coriolis force.

### Definition of Current Terms

Currents have both strength and direction. The proper terms should be used in describing each of these characteristics.

The set of a current is the direction toward which it is flowing. A current that flows from north to south is termed a southerly current and has a set of 180 degrees. (Note the difference here from the manner in which wind direction is described—it is exactly the opposite: a wind from north to south is called a northerly wind with a direction described as 000 degrees.)

The drift of a current is its speed, normally in knots, except for river currents, which are in mph (1 knot = 1.15 mph = 1.85 km/hr). Current drift is stated to the nearest tenth of a knot.

The term velocity is rarely used in connection with current, but if it is, it requires a statement of both strength and direction.

A tidal current is said to flood when it flows in from the sea and results in higher tidal stages. Conversely, a tidal current ebbs when the flow is seaward and water levels fall.

#### Slack vs. Stand

As these currents reverse, there are brief periods of no discernible flow, called slack or slack water. The time of occurrence of slack is not the same as the time of stand, when vertical rise or fall of the tide has stopped. Tidal currents do not automatically slack and reverse direction when tide levels stand at high or low water. High water at a given point simply means that the level there will not get any higher. Further up the bay or river, the tide will not have reached its maximum height, and water must therefore continue to flow in so that it can continue to rise. The current can still be flooding after stand has been passed at a given point and the level has started to fall.

For example, consider the tides and currents on Chesapeake Bay. High tide occurs at Baltimore some seven hours after it does at Smith Point, roughly halfway up the 140 miles from Cape Henry at the Bay’s entrance to Baltimore. On a certain day, high water occurs at 1126 at Smith Point, but slack water does not occur until 1304. The flooding current has thus continued for 1h 38m after high water was reached.

Corresponding time intervals occur in the case of low water stand and the slack between ebb and flood currents.

In many places, the time lag between a low or high water stand and slack water is not a matter of minutes but of hours. At the Narrows in New York Harbor, flood current continues for about two hours after high water is reached and the tide begins to fall, and continues to ebb for roughly two and a half hours after low-water stand. After slack, the current increases until mid-flood or mid-ebb, and then gradually decreases. Where ebb and flood last for about six hours—as along the Atlantic seaboard—current will be strongest about three hours after slack. Thus, the skipper who figures his passage out through the Narrows from the time of high water, rather than slack, will start about two and a half hours too soon and will run into an opposing current at nearly its maximum strength.

### Current Effects

A current of any type can have a significant effect on the travel of a boat with respect to the bottom. Speed can be increased or decreased; the course made good can be markedly different from that steered. For safe and efficient navigation, a boater must know how to determine and apply current effects.

#### Effect on Course & Speed Made Good

A current directly in line with a boat’s motion through the water will have a maximum effect on the speed made good, but no off-course influence. The effect can be of significance when figuring your ETA at your destination. It can even affect the safety of your boat and its crew if you have figured your fuel too closely and have run into a bow-on current.

A current that is nearly at a right angle to your course through the water will have a maximum effect on the course made good and a minor effect on the distance that you must travel to reach your destination.

Knowledge of current set and drift can assist your cruising. Select departure times to take advantage of favorable currents, or at least to minimize adverse effects. A 12-knot boat speed and a 2-knot current, reasonably typical situations, can combine to result in either a 10-knot or a 14-knot speed made good—the 40 percent gain from a favorable current over an opposing one is significant in terms of both time and fuel. For slower craft the gains are even greater: 50 percent for a 10-knot boat, 67 percent for an 8-knot craft, and 100 percent for one making only 6 knots.

Even lesser currents have significance. A ½-knot current would hinder a swimmer and make rowing a boat noticeably more difficult. A 1-knot current can significantly affect a sailboat in light breezes.

#### Difficult Locations

In many boating areas, there are locations where current conditions can be critical. Numerous ocean inlets are difficult or dangerous in certain combinations of current and onshore surf. In general, difficult surf conditions will be made more hazardous by an outward-flowing (ebbing) current. The topic of inlet seamanship is covered in more detail on this page. In many narrow bodies of water, the maximum current velocity is so high that passage is impossible for boats of limited power, and substantially slowed for boats of greater engine power; see Figure 17-16. Such narrow passages are particularly characteristic of Pacific Northwest boating areas, but do occur elsewhere. Currents in New York City’s East River reach 4.6 knots, and they are more than 5 knots at the Golden Gate of San Francisco. Velocities of 3.5 to 4 knots are common in much-traveled passages like Woods Hole, Massachusetts, and Plum Gut at the eastern end of Long Island Sound.

Figure 17-16 In some passages, tidal currents are so strong that all but the fastest boats avoid running against the strongest flood and ebb. Skippers of less powerful craft must plan for passage at slack water or with a favorable current. New York’s East River, shown here, is one such passage.

### Tidal Current Predictions

Without experience or official information, local current prediction is always risky. For example, east of Badgers Island in Portsmouth (NH) Harbor, the maximum ebb current is predicted at less than a half knot. Yet just southwest of the same island, the tabular maximum is 3.7 knots.

One rule is fairly safe for most locations—the ebb is stronger and lasts longer than the flood. Eighty percent of all reference stations on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts of the U.S. report stronger currents in the ebb. This is normal because river flow adds to the ebb but hinders the flood.

On the Atlantic Coast, expect to find two approximately equal flood currents and two similar ebb currents in a cycle of about 24 hours and 50 minutes. On the Pacific Coast, however, the two floods and the two ebbs differ markedly. On the Gulf Coast, there may be just one flood and one ebb in 25 hours. In each case these patterns are, of course, generally similar to tidal action in their respective areas.

Don’t try to predict current velocity from the time that it takes a high tide to reach a given point from the sea’s entrance. Dividing the distance from Cape Henry to Baltimore by the time that it takes high water to work its way up Chesapeake Bay gives a speed of 13 knots. True maximum flood current strength is only about one knot.

Another important fact is that tidal currents at different places cannot be forecast from their tidal ranges. You would expect strong currents at Eastport, Maine, where the difference between successive high and low waters reaches as much as 20 feet. And you would be right; there are 3-knot currents there. But Galveston, Texas, with only a 2-foot range of tides, has currents up to more than 2 knots. So has Miami, with a 3-foot range, and Charleston, South Carolina, with a 6-foot range—these are stronger currents than Boston, where the range is often more than 10 feet, and as strong as at Anchorage, Alaska, where it’s as much as 35 feet from some highs to the next low.

A good forecasting rule for all oceans: expect strong tidal currents where two bays meet. The reason: tidal ranges and high water times in the two bodies of water are likely to be different.

For the coasting skipper, here is another tidal current fact that may be useful near the beach: flood and ebb don’t usually set to and from shore, but rather parallel with it. This is as true off New Jersey and Florida as it is off California and Oregon. A few miles offshore, however, and in some very large bays, the current behaves quite differently—for example, the rotary current mentioned previously in this chapter.

### Tidal Current Tables

At any given place, current strength varies with the phases of the moon and its distance from the earth. It will be strongest when tidal ranges are greatest—near new and full moon—and weakest when tidal ranges are least: near first and last quarters. Current speed may vary as much as 40 percent above and below its average value.

The consistent relationship of tidal currents to tides in any given place means that once that relationship is empirically determined, future tidal currents can be predicted based on future tides. NOS provides data for two volumes of predictions annually; one covers the Atlantic Coast of North America and the other the Pacific Coast of North America and Asia. These books are printed and sold commercially in the same manner as the Tide Tables, and NOS also makes the data available to boaters at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov.

These Tidal Current Tables include predictions of tidal currents in bays, sounds, and rivers, plus ocean currents such as the Gulf Stream. General information on wind-driven currents is also included, although these, of course, cannot be predicted a year or more ahead. Your own past experience and local knowledge are the best sources of information about how storm winds affect local waters. The two printed volumes of the Tidal Current Tables are available at most sales agents for charts and nautical publications.

#### Description of Tables

The format and layout of the Tidal Current Tables is much the same as for the Tide Tables discussed earlier in this chapter. A system of reference stations, plus constants and differences for subordinate stations, is used to calculate the predictions for many points.

Table 1. There are 22 reference stations in the Atlantic Coast volume and 36 for the Pacific Coast; the Gulf of Mexico is included in the Atlantic Coast volume. For each station, there are tabulated predicted times and strengths of maximum flood and ebb currents, plus the times of slack water. The direction of the flood and ebb currents is also listed; see Figure 17-17.

Figure 17-17 This is an extract from Table 1 of the Tidal Current Tables; it will be used in the examples shown on this page. The times in this table are EDT for dates on which daylight savings time is in use.

Table 2. Time differences and velocity ratios are listed for hundreds of subordinate stations; see Figure 17-18. Following the station number and descriptive location, there is depth at which the reading was taken and then the latitude and longitude to the nearest minute. Time differences are given for maximum flood and ebb, and for minimum current (usually slack) before flood and before ebb. Speed ratios are tabulated for maximum current in both directions (given in degrees, true, for direction toward which current flows). Also listed are average speeds and directions, including speed at slack as currents do not always decrease fully to zero velocity. A few stations will have only the entry “Current weak and variable”; this information, even though negative in nature, is useful in planning a cruise. A number of endnotes are used to explain special conditions at various stations; these are found at the end of Table 2.

Figure 17-18 The tidal current examples in the text use this extract from Table 2 for time and speed differences to be applied to the reference station.

Note that when you access tidal current predictions at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov for a particular subordinate station, the Table 2 corrections are applied for you, and the corrected data are ready for use.

Table 3. This ratio table is in two separate parts; one is for normal reversing currents (as in Figure 17-19) and the other (not shown) is for hydraulic currents at specified locations, and provides a convenient means for determining the current’s strength at times intermediate between slack and maximum velocity. Use the nearest tabulated values (as shown) without interpolation.

Figure 17-19 Table 3 of the Tidal Current Tables is used to determine the speed of the current at intermediate times between slack and maximum flow. It is in two parts; Table A, shown here, is used for all locations except for a few unique places that are covered in Table B (not shown).

Table 4. Although slack water is only a momentary event, there is a period of time on either side of slack during which the current is so weak as to be negligible for practical piloting purposes. This period, naturally, varies with the maximum strength of the current, being longer for weak currents. Two subtables predict the duration of currents from 0.1 to 0.5 knots by tenths for normal reversing currents and for the hydraulic currents found at certain specified locations; see Figure 17-20.

Figure 17-20 Slack is a period during which the current slows down and reverses. The length of slack is a question of how slow is slow enough. Table 4, Duration of Slack, is in two parts: Part A, shown here, is applicable in all locations except for a few that are covered in Part B (not shown). This table permits the calculation of the predicted duration of a flow that is less than, or equal to, a desired value.

Table 5. For the Atlantic Coast only, information is given on rotary tidal currents at various offshore points of navigational interest. These points are described in terms of general location and specific geographic coordinates. Predictions of velocity and direction are referred to times after maximum flood at designated reference stations.

The inside back cover of the Tidal Current Tables has the same astronomical data as is found in the Tide Tables; see this page.

#### Tidal Current Diagrams

For a number of major tidal waterways of the United States, Tidal Current Tables give current diagram—graphic means for selecting a favorable time for traveling in either direction along these routes; see Figure 17-21.

Figure 17-21 A tidal current diagram, such as this one for Chesapeake Bay, helps choose the time for a passage up or down the bay at a particular speed. See the text, Tidal Current Example 6, for how it is used.

#### Time

Depending on publisher and format, Tidal Current Tables may list all predictions in local standard time. Be sure to make an appropriate conversion to daylight time if this is needed. Subtract an hour from your watch time before using the tables, and add an hour to the results of your calculations. (Some commercial publishers make the conversion to daylight time, and the NOS tables, when accessed online at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov, can be formatted by the user to conform to daylight time or to read consistently in standard time. Check carefully the tables that you use.)

Cautions: As with tidal predictions, the data in the Tidal Current Tables may often be upset by sustained abnormal local weather conditions such as wind or rainfall. Use the current predictions with caution during and immediately after such weather phenomena.

Note also that tidal current predictions are generally for a spot location only; the set and drift may be quite different only a mile or less away. This is at variance from predictions of high and low tides, which can usually be used over fairly wide areas around the reference station.

### Examples of Tidal Current Calculations

The Tidal Current Tables contain all information needed for determining such predicted conditions as the time of maximum current and its strength, the time of slack water, and the duration of slack (actually, the duration of the very weak current conditions). Tidal current examples and solutions for typical problems follow, with comments and cautions. The extracts from the Tidal Current Tables that are necessary to work Tidal Current Examples 1 through 6 are given in Figures 17-17 through 17-21.

### Supplementary Sources of Information

The ultimate source of current information is your own eyesight and past experience. These are most helpful even where there are predictions from the NOS tables. As noted before, the tabular data are predicated on “normal” conditions, and may be easily upset by unusual circumstances. Strong winds will, for example, drive water into or out of bays and modify tidal levels and currents.

##### TIDAL CURRENT EXAMPLE 1

Determining the predicted time and strength of maximum current, and the time of slack, at a Reference Station.

Problem: What is the predicted time and strength of the maximum ebb current at Chesapeake Bay Entrance during the afternoon of 16 October?

Solution: As Chesapeake Bay Entrance is a Reference Station, the answer is available by direct inspection of Table 1.

The table shown in Figure 17-17 is a typical page from the Tidal Current Tables. We can see that the maximum ebb current on the specified afternoon is 1.9 knots and that it occurs at 1454 EDT. An entry at the top of the page tells us that ebbs at this station have a set of 129 degrees true.

Problem: What is the predicted time of the first slack before flood at this station on 21 October?

Solution: Table 1 does not directly identify the slacks as being “slack before ebb” or “slack before flood”; this must be determined by comparing the slack time with the nature of the next maximum current that occurs.

From the table, we can see that the earliest slack that will be followed by a flooding current at Chesapeake Bay Entrance on 21 October is predicted to occur at 1000 EDT.

Notes

1. NOS formerly used local standard time but now adjusts for daylight saving time when appropriate. You may still encounter tables that are referenced strictly to standard time, however; if you do, you’ll have to add one hour to tabulated times in months when daylight saving time is in effect.

2. The direction of the current for a reference station is found at the top of the page in Table 1. It is also given in Table 2, which lists further information such as the geographic coordinates of the station.

3. The normal day at Chesapeake Bay Entrance, where the tide is of the semidiurnal type, will have four slacks and four maximums. The tidal cycle of 24h and 50m will result in the occasional omission of a slack or maximum. You can see that a slack occurs very late on 20 October; the flood that follows it occurs on the following date.

##### TIDAL CURRENT EXAMPLE 2

Determining the time and strength of maximum current, and the time of slack, at a subordinate station.

Problem: What is the predicted time and strength of the morning maximum flood current at Lynnhaven Inlet bridge on 16 December?

Solution: Table 2 (refer to Figure 17-18) gives time differences and velocity ratios to be applied to the predictions at the appropriate reference station. There is an index to Table 2 at the back of the Tidal Current Tables if it is needed to locate the given subordinate station.

For Lynnhaven Inlet bridge, the time difference and speed ratio are applied as follows:

Time

 

Velocity

09 50

Chesapeake Bay Entrance

1.2

-1:10

Lynnhaven factor

0.7

08 40

morning flood at Lynnhaven

0.8

The set (direction) of the current is also noted from the appropriate column of Table 2; in this case, it is 180° true. Thus the predictions are for a maximum current of 0.8 knot setting 180° true at Lynnhaven Inlet bridge at 0840 on 16 December.

Problem: What is the predicted time of the first afternoon slack water at Lynnhaven Inlet bridge on 17 October?

Solution: Table 1 shows the first afternoon slack for this date (1218) as a slack before ebb begins, but the time difference of −1.18 (from Table 2) makes it a morning slack at the Subordinate Station. So the next slack, which is before flood at 1858, must be used.

18 58 Chesapeake Bay Entrance

−1:18 difference for subordinate station

17 40 at Lynnhaven Inlet bridge

Notes

1. Observe that Table 2 shows separate time differences for the four events of a tidal current cycle; always carefully check the column headings and select the proper time difference. Note also that the speed ratios for maximum flood and ebb currents are normally different.

2. The direction of the current at a subordinate station nearly always differs from that of a reference station; it must be taken from Table 2. No statement of current is complete without giving direction as well as strength.

3. If you access the Lynnhaven Inlet bridge station at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov, the time and velocity differences from the Chesapeake Bay Entrance station will be applied for you.

##### TIDAL CURRENT EXAMPLE 3

Determining the strength and set of a current, at an intermediate time at a reference station.

Problem: What is the predicted strength and set of the current at Chesapeake Bay Entrance at 1620 on 1 October?

Solution: The times of slack and maximum current (ebb or flood) that bracket the desired time are found from Table 1. The interval between these times is determined, as is the interval between the desired time and slack.

18 11 time of nearest slack

14 56 time of maximum ebb current

3:15 interval, slack—maximum current

18 11 time of nearest slack

16 20 desired time

1:51 interval, slack—desired time

Once you have established these time intervals, Table 3A (see Figure 17-19) is used to determine the ratio of the strength of the current at the desired time to its maximum strength. The nearest tabulated values are used, with no interpolation. In this example, the ratio at the intersection of the line for 2h 00m (closest to 1h 51m) and the column for 3 h 20m (closest to 3h 15m) is found to be 0.8. Multiply the maximum current by this decimal fraction, 1.2 x 0.8 = 0.96 (which is used as 1.0).

From the times used, we note that the current is ebbing. From the top of Table 1, we determine that the direction is 129° true. So on 1 October, at 1620, the current at Chesapeake Bay Entrance will be 1.0 knots setting 129° true.

Notes

1. Except as specially indicated, use Table 3A, the upper portion of Table 3; refer to Figure 17-19. The lower portion (B) is intended for use in designated waterways only.

2. Be sure that the interval is calculated between the desired time and the time of slack, whether or not this time is nearer to the given time than the time of maximum current.

3. Note that calculations of current strength are rounded to the nearest tenth of a knot.

##### TIDAL CURRENT EXAMPLE 4

Determining the current, at an intermediate time at a subordinate station.

Problem: What is the predicted strength and set of the current at a point 5.5 miles east of Stingray Point (the subordinate station) at 0835 on 16 October?

Solution: First, the predictions for time of slack and maximum current must be found for the subordinate station.

With the information developed above, and the desired time, further calculations are made as follows:

11 33 time of maximum at subordinate station

07 38 time of slack at subordinate station

3:55 interval between slack and maximum current

08 35 desired time when strength is needed

07 38 time of slack at subordinate station

0:57 interval between slack and desired time

Using Table 3A, the intersection between the line of interval to desired time is 1h 00m (closest to 0h 57 m) and the column for 4h 00m (closest to 3h 55m), the speed ratio is found to be 0.4. Next, multiply 0.4 x 1.9 (the maximum speed of current at the subordinate station) = 0.8.

Table 2 indicates that the direction of maximum flood current at Stingray Point is 343° true.

The current at 0835 at a point 5.5 miles east of Stingray Point on 16 October is predicted to be 0.8 knot setting 343° true.

Notes

1. If you access the Stingray Point station at http://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov, the time and velocity differences from the Chesapeake Bay Entrance station will be applied for you.

##### TIDAL CURRENT EXAMPLE 5

Determining the duration of slack (weak current) at a designated point.

Problem: For how long is it predicted that the current be not more than 0.4 knots around the time of first slack before ebb on 19 October at Chesapeake Bay Entrance?

Solution: Table 1 for this date shows the maximum currents on either side of this slack (0117) as 1.0 knots flood (2212 on the 18th) and 1.5 knots ebb (0448 on the 19th)

Use Table 4A (Figure 17-20) to find the duration of current less than 0.4 knot for each maximum. One-half of each such duration is used for the period from 0.4 to 0 knots and then 0 to 0.4 knots.

The value for the ending flood current is one-half of 94, or 47 minutes; for the beginning ebb current, it is one-half of 62, or 31 minutes. The duration will be 47 + 31 = 78m.

##### TIDAL CURRENT EXAMPLE 6

Use of a current diagram.

Problem: For an afternoon run up Chesapeake Bay from Smith Point Light to Sandy Point Light at 10 knots on 21 October, what time should you depart from Smith Point Light for the most favorable current conditions?

Solution: Use the current diagram for Chesapeake Bay; refer to Figure 17-21. Draw a line on the diagram parallel to the 10-knot northbound speed line so that it fits generally in the center of the shaded area marked “Flood.” (You might use parallel rules to walk the line across.) Find the point where this 10-knot line intersects with the horizontal line marked “Smith Point Light.” Project downward from this point to the scale at the bottom of the diagram. The mark here is “0h after ebb begins at the entrance.” Referring to Table 1, it will be seen that on the given date, the afternoon slack before ebb occurs at 1606.

For a run up Chesapeake Bay to Sandy Point Light at 10 knots on the afternoon of 21 October, it is predicted that the most favorable current will be available if you leave Smith Point Light at about 1606.

Notes

1. Similar solutions can be worked out for southbound trips, but on longer runs you will probably be faced with favorable and unfavorable current conditions. Choose a starting time to minimize adverse conditions.

2. Conditions shown on current diagrams are averages and for typical conditions; small variations should be expected in specific conditions.

## THE EFFECTS OF CURRENTS ON PILOTING

One of the more interesting problems in small-boat piloting is the matter of currents and their effects upon boat speed, upon the courses that must be steered to make good a desired track, and upon the time required to reach a destination. This is known as current sailing (it applies to power vessels as well as sailing craft).

As a boat is propelled and steered through the water, it moves with respect to it. At the same time the water itself may be moving with respect to the bottom and the shore because of current. The resultant motion of the boat is the net effect of these two motions combined, with regard to both speed and direction. As a consequence, the actual course made good over the bottom will not be the same as the DR track, in terms of either course or speed.

Leeway, the leeward (away from the wind) motion of a vessel due to the wind, affects sailboats and, to a lesser extent, larger motorboats. However, the wind’s effect need not be considered separately from current—the two may be lumped together along with such factors as wave action on the boat. The total offsetting influence of all of these factors collectively is termed “current.”

A prediction of current effect can be added to a plot of a DR track to obtain an estimated position (EP), plotted as a small square with a dot in the center; see Figure 17-22.

Figure 17-22 If the current is known or can be estimated, a DR plot (the half circles) can be modified to show a series of estimated positions (EPs, plotted as small squares).

Among all of these possible influences acting on a vessel, tidal current is by far the most important, and it should never be underestimated. Unexpected current is always a threat to the skipper because it can quickly carry his boat off course, and possibly into dangerous water. The risk is greater with slower boat speeds and under conditions of reduced visibility.

### Piloting & Current Sailing Terms

The terms “course” and “speed” are used in DR plots for the motion of the boat through the water without regard to current. Before we consider the influence of currents on piloting, there are a few terms to become familiar with and to review; see Figure 17-23.

Figure 17-23 Just as lines are plotted on a chart, the DR current diagram must always be carefully labeled. Direction is shown above the line and speed below.

• The intended track is the expected path of the boat, as plotted on a chart, after consideration has been given to the effect of current.

• Track, abbreviated as TR, is the direction (true) of the intended track line.

• Speed of advance, SOA, is the intended rate of travel along the intended track line. Note that the intended track will not always be the actual track, and so two more terms are needed:

• Course over the ground, COG, is the direction of the actual path of the boat, the track made good; it is sometimes termed course made good (CMG).

• Speed over the ground, abbreviated as SOG, is the actual rate of travel along this track; it is sometimes termed speed made good (SMG).

• Set is the direction toward which a current is flowing—a current that is flowing from north to south is said to have a set of 180°. (Note that this is exactly the opposite from the manner in which wind direction is described.)

• Drift is the speed of a current. Its units may be knots or miles per hour as determined by the waters concerned.

### Current Situations

A study of the effects of current resolves itself into two basic situations. The first situation occurs when the set of the current is in the same direction as the boat’s motion, or is in exactly the opposite direction. In the second situation, the direction of the current is at an angle to the boat’s course, either a right or an oblique angle.

The first situation is the simplest to solve. The speed of the current—the drift—is added to or subtracted from the speed through the water to obtain the speed over the ground. The course over the ground (or intended track) is the same as the DR course—COG equals C, as does TR.

Since a GPS receiver shows course and speed over the ground, a boater need not calculate the effects of current set and drift as long as GPS is working correctly. But the wise navigator will know how to solve current diagrams in order to predict such effects ahead of time (and their likely impacts on courses made good and ETAs) and as a hedge when the electronics stop working.

### Vector Current Diagrams

When the boat’s motion and the set of the current form an angle with each other, the solution for the resultant course and speed is more complex, but still not difficult. Several methods may be used, but a graphic solution using a vector current diagram is usually the easiest to understand.

The accuracy with which the resultant course and speed can be determined depends largely on the accuracy with which the current has been determined. Values of the current usually must be taken from tidal current tables or charts, or estimated by the skipper from visual observations.

Basically, a vector current diagram represents the two component motions separately, as if they occurred independently and sequentially—which, of course, they do not. These diagrams can be drawn in terms of velocities or distances. “Velocity” has a more detailed meaning than “speed,” since it is speed in a given linear direction, at a timed rate and within a frame of reference. The diagrams in this text will graph motions in terms of their velocities.

Such diagrams may also be called “vector triangles of velocity.” The term “vector” in mathematics means quantity that has both magnitude and direction—directed quantities. In current sailing, the directed quantities are the motions of the boat and the water (the current).

### Vectors

A vector may be represented graphically by an arrow, a segment of a straight line with an arrowhead indicating the direction, and the length of the line scaled to the speed; see Figure 17-24. If we specify that a certain unit of line length is equal to a certain unit of speed—that one inch equals one knot, for example—then two such vectors can graphically represent two different velocities. Any speed scale may be used, the larger the better for accuracy. However, the size of the available paper and working space will normally control the scale.

Figure 17-24 A vector has direction as shown by the arrowhead. It has magnitude as shown by its length. Both are referenced to a convenient scale.

Vector current diagrams may be drawn on a chart either as part of the plot or separately. If drawn on plain paper, it is wise to draw in a north line as the reference for measuring directions.

Since boats are subject to two distinct motions—the boat through the water, and the water with respect to the bottom—we will now consider how the resultant motion, or vector sum, is obtained by current diagrams.

#### Vector Triangles

When the two motions are not in line with each other, they form two sides of a triangle; see Figure 17-25. Completing the triangle gives the third side, which will be a vector representing the resultant motion or velocity. Consequently, when any two velocity vectors are drawn to the same scale and form the sides of a velocity triangle, the third side will be the resultant velocity vector (the vector sum of the other two), and its direction and magnitude may be measured from the diagram.

Figure 17-25 Vectors may be combined—their quantities added—graphically. In this sketch, vectors a and b are added, and their sum is vector c. The sum vector can be measured for both magnitude (length) and direction in the same manner as you would measure a line on a chart.

It may be easier to visualize the component motions if a time period of one hour is used and the points that are the corners of the triangle are considered as positions of the boat before and after certain motions, as follows:

• “O”—the origin

• “DR”—the DR position of the boat as a result solely of its motion through the water.

• “W”—the position of the boat solely as a result of the motion of the water.

• “P”—the position (intended or actual) of the boat as a result of the combined action of the component motions.

It should be noted that although in some cases two of the above letters are applicable to a position, it is customary to use only one.

#### “Tail-to-Head” Relationships

Note carefully how the vectors, one representing current and the other the boat’s motion through the water are drawn “tail-to-head.” (This rule applies only when one of the vectors is current, not when both represent the boat’s motion.)

If a boat’s motion through the water (vector a) and the current’s set and drift (vector b) are both known, either may be drawn first from the origin. In Figure 17-26, drawing A and drawing B both yield the same result for vector c.

Figure 17-26 Vector diagrams A and B appear to be different because vectors a and b have been drawn in reverse sequence. But the sum, c, is the same in both instances.

### The Four Cases of Current Problems

There are four typical current problems, designated for convenience as Cases 1, 2, 3, and 4; see this page.

• Case 1: What is the set and drift of an unknown current from observation of its effect?

• Case 2: What is the effect of a known current if no allowance is made for it while running a DR course?

• Case 3: What is the corrected course to be steered, without regard for the effect on speed or estimated time of arrival?

• Case 4: What is the course and speed to arrive at a specified time? This is the “rendezvous” or “contest” case; see Figure 17-27.

Figure 17-27 Proceeding toward a rendezvous point, this skipper compensates for the effect of current by adjusting his course and speed so that he arrives at his destination at the desired time.

We will run through each case three times: first using the traditional tools and skills of piloting; second using GPS; and finally using a chartplotter.

##### CASE 1: DETERMINING CURRENT SET & DRIFT

This is a situation in which you know the course you have steered and the speed through the water from either the speed curve of your boat or a marine speedometer. It is also obvious to you that you did not arrive at your DR position. From your chart plot, you have been able to determine the course and speed over the ground. Current has acted to set you off your course—you desire to know its set and drift.

After again drawing a north reference line, plot vectors for your motion through the water—C 255°, S 12 knots, and your motion with respect to the bottom—COG 245°, SOG 13.4 knots. These vectors are both drawn outward from the origin, O, to points DR and P respectively. The “tail-to-head” rule is not applicable, as neither of these vectors represents current.

The action of the current has been to offset your boat from DR to P (which is also point W in this case); thus the set is the direction from DR toward P, and the drift is the length of this line in scale units.

In the diagram, the current is found to be setting 192° with a drift of 2.6 knots. This is the average current for the time period and the location of the run from O to P for which the calculations were made; it is not the current at P. For the next leg of your cruise, these current values can be used as is, or modified as required by the passage of time and/or the continuing change in position of the boat.

If you’re navigating with GPS or a chartplotter, the Case 1 scenario could proceed as follows:

Case 1 with GPS. As above, you steer 255° true at a speed through the water of 12 knots, winding up at position P rather than DR. Your GPS receiver gives you the lat/lon coordinates of P, and it also gives you the bearing and distance of DR (which you programmed into the receiver as a waypoint) from P. The receiver will display the bearing of DR in degrees true, degrees magnetic, or both, and the reciprocal of that bearing (in degrees true) represents the current set. The distance of P from DR, when referred to a 1-hour elapsed time, is the current drift. For example, if the distance of P from DR is 1.3 nautical miles after a run of 30 minutes, the average current drift during the run from O to P was 2.6 knots. No vector plotting is necessary.

The prevailing current (actually the net effect of all offsetting influences) can be found graphically by plotting vectors for the DR track of the boat and its actual course and speed for a given time, then adding the vector from DR to P.

Case 1 with chartplotter. You steer 255° true at a speed through the water of 12 knots, winding up at position P rather than DR. Your chartplotter displays your boat’s position with an icon at P on a digital chart, and gives you the lat/lon coordinates of P. If you pause the cursor over DR, it gives you the bearing and distance of DR, from which you can derive current set and drift as with GPS. There is no need to program the coordinates of DR into the chartplotter as a waypoint; simply pause your cursor over DR’s charted location.

Using GPS or a chartplotter in this fashion is easier and more convenient than vector plotting, but it is also an unlikely use of GPS or a chartplotter. There is no reason to diverge from an intended track—and perhaps wander unwittingly into hazardous waters–when you can rely on GPS or a chartplotter. Cases 3 and 4 below will make this clear.

##### CASE 2: FINDING THE EFFECT OF CURRENT ON A BOAT’S COURSE & SPEED

If the set of the current and the boat’s course through the water are as shown in the diagrams in Figure 17-26, then the boat will be set off to the right of the direction in which it is being steered.

We will use a current diagram (shown at right) to determine the exact extent of this effect; we will also determine the path that the boat can be expected to follow, as well as its speed along that path (in other words, the intended track and speed of advance), given a boat speed through the water of 10 knots and a current set of 130° and drift of 3 knots.

We first draw in a North line as a reference for measuring directions in the diagram, and then the vector for the boat’s speed through the water, O-DR, a line drawn from the origin in the direction of 070° for a length of 10 units. Next, we add the vector for current, DR-W, three units in the direction of 130°. Note that we have observed the “tail-to-head” relationship rule. (Either of these two vectors could have been drawn first; the triangle would appear differently, but the result will be the same.)

Because these vectors form two sides of a triangle of velocities, the third side, O-W, is the resultant velocity at which the boat moves with respect to the bottom under the combined influences of its propulsion and the current. The point W can now be relabeled “P.” The intended (or expected) track (TR) and the speed of advance (SOA) can be measured from the O-P line.

In this example, the results indicate that the boat can be expected to sail a course over the ground of 083° and to have a speed advance of 11.8 knots. Bear in mind that the directions of these vectors are plotted as true directions.

Summarizing briefly, we have drawn vectors to indicate independently the motion of the boat from two different influences—that of its own propulsion and that of the current. Actually, of course, the boat will not go first from O to DR and then on to P. All the time, it will travel directly along the intended track O-P. The boat is steered on course C, the direction of O-DR, but due to the effect of current, it is expected to travel along the intended track O-P. This is the intended route that must be considered for shoals and other hazards to navigation.

The north reference line is drawn first but is not needed if the diagram is plotted directly on a chart. This shows the vector line for the course and speed.

The vector for current set and drift is added; note the “tail-to-head” relationship of this second vector to the first one.

The connecting vector from O to P shows the resultant motion and speed of the boat over the bottom.

Case 2 with GPS. With GPS at your disposal, you can ascertain the effects of current on your boat’s course and speed without having to calculate the expected current from the Tidal Current Tables. Having programmed your intended destination, DR, into your GPS receiver as a waypoint, you start your run toward DR on a course steered of 070° at a speed through the water of 10 knots, monitoring your course over ground and the bearing to DR on the GPS display as you go. The initial bearing to DR is 070°, but the receiver may tell you that your course over ground is 083°, not 070°, and your speed over ground is 11.8 knots. You have learned this quickly, accurately, and without having to plot vectors. This is no reason not to have a handle on the local set and drift of the current, however. Without such knowledge you are blindly following an electronic black box—and that’s never wise.

If you continue to steer a course of 070°, the bearing to DR will soon begin to change—to 069°, then 068°, etc.—and the cross-track error function on your GPS receiver will show that you are diverging more and more from your intended track. To prevent this, you must alter course to compensate, as in Case 3 below.

Case 2 with chartplotter. If you are navigating with a chartplotter that is receiving GPS input (or with navigation software on a laptop that is interfaced with GPS), you don’t even have to program the intended destination, DR, as a waypoint. Simply begin your run toward DR and watch your boat’s progress across the digital chart. Pause the cursor over DR to note its bearing, and read your COG and SOG from the chartplotter display.

##### CASE 3: A TYPICAL CRUISING SITUATION

Here you know the track you desire to make good (TR 080°), you have decided to run at your normal cruising speed through the water (S 10 knots), and you have calculated (or estimated) the current’s set (140°) and drift (4 knots). What you desire to know is the course to be steered (C) and the speed of advance (SOA), which can be used to figure your estimated time of arrival (ETA).

Draw in a North line and measure direction from it (see the diagram below). Plot the current vector O-W, at the specified direction and length, and a line (not a vector yet) from O in the direction of the intended track—this line should be of indefinite length at this time. From point W, swing an arc, with dividers or drawing compass, equal in length to the speed through the water in scale units. The point at which this arc intersects the intended track line is point P, and the vector triangle has been completed.

The direction of W-P is the course to be steered (C 060°); the length of the vector O-P is the speed over the ground (SOA 11.4), and from this the ETA can be calculated.

Let us look at the reasoning behind this graphic solution of Case 3. Again considering the component motions separately for the sake of simplicity, the boat is moved by current from O to W. It is to move from W at the specified speed through the water, but must get back on the intended track line—the problem is to find the point P on the track that is “S” units from point W. The solution is found by swinging an arc as described above. Remember that all vectors are plotted as true directions, including C, the course to be steered in the preceding solution. This must be changed to a compass direction (course) for actual use at the helm.

The DR Track

In accordance with the principles of dead reckoning, it is desirable to plot the DR track even though a current is known to exist. This line, drawn from point O in the direction C and with a length of S scale units, forms a basis for consideration of possible hazard if the current is not as calculated or estimated.

Case 3 with GPS. With GPS you can do more than ascertain the effects of current on your boat’s course and speed without having to estimate the expected current or calculate it from the Tidal Current Tables, as in Case 2. You can also take the next logical step and correct for those effects.

At position O, enter your intended destination, P, into your GPS receiver as a waypoint, and the receiver gives the bearing of P as 080°. Accordingly you start your run toward P on a course steered of 080° at a speed through the water of 10 knots, monitoring your course over ground and the bearing to P on the GPS display as you go. Because the current is setting you to the right of your intended track, your COG will be greater than 080°, and the bearing to P will begin to change—to 079°, 078°, etc. To prevent this, you alter course to port until your COG is 080°—directly toward P—at which point you are steering 060° through the water. You are now proceeding crabwise, with your bow pointing well to port of P to compensate for the current.

Now that you’re heading toward P, you can read your speed over ground from the GPS display—the vector sum of boat speed and the effects of current—and find it to be 11.4 knots. You can also read your ETA for destination P.

If current set or drift should change as the run toward P progresses, you will detect this (provided you are monitoring the GPS) in a renewed cross-track error, and can correct as necessary.

If you were to proceed from position O on a course steered of 060°, failing to correct for current, your GPS receiver would display a progressively wider cross-track error, meaning that you were diverging more and more from your intended track. If you have programmed your receiver’s cross-track error alarm function, it will sound an alarm when you reach a preset error limit. There is an obvious safety value in presetting the alarm at less than the half-width of safe water in the alleyway along which you are proceeding.

Case 3 with chartplotter. If you are navigating with a chartplotter that is receiving GPS input (or with navigation software on a laptop that is interfaced with GPS), you don’t even have to program the intended destination, P, as a waypoint. Simply begin your run toward P and watch your boat’s progress across the digital chart. Pause the cursor over P to note its bearing, and adjust your course steered until your COG matches that bearing. If you don’t get around to this until your COG has diverged substantially from your intended track, a look at the digital chart will tell you whether your cross-track error has inadvertently placed a charted hazard (say, an isolated half-tide ledge) between your present position and P. If it has, the chart will also tell you how to detour around that hazard.

Like a GPS receiver, the chartplotter will display your SOG and your destination ETA. There is no vector plotting and no guesswork until the electronics malfunction and you need to fall back on traditional piloting skills.

If you know your desired track, and your speed through the water, a graphic solution can be used to determine the course to be steered and the speed of advance. For safety, a DR plot is added.

##### CASE 4: RENDEZVOUS

This is a variation of Case 3, in which you want to arrive at a specified point at a given time. It may be that you are competing in a predicted log contest, or merely that you have agreed to meet friends at that time and place. In addition to the data on current that you have, you have decided upon your track and your speed of advance. In the diagram at right, let us assume that the current sets 205° at 3 knots. You need to make good a track of 320°, and a quick speed-distance-time calculation sets your required speed of advance at 11.5 knots.

From the north reference line, draw the current vector O-W and the intended track vector O-P. Complete the triangle with the vector W-P, which will give you the course to be steered (C 332 True) and the speed to run through the water (S 13.0) to arrive at the destination at the desired time. Line O-DR should be drawn in from the origin as a dead-reckoning track for the sake of safety.

Case 4 with GPS. Having input waypoint P into the GPS receiver, you read the bearing of P (320°) on the GPS display and set out from O on a course of 320°. A southwest current sets you to the left of your intended track, however, so you alter course to starboard until your COG is 320°, at which point you are steering 332°. Then you adjust your throttle until your ETA matches the desired time, at which point your speed through the water is 13.0 knots and your speed of advance is 11.5 knots.

Case 4 with chartplotter. Proceed as with GPS, except that you don’t need to input P as a waypoint, and you can watch your progress across the digital chart. If you’re used to plotting current vectors, this is so easy it feels like cheating.

This problem concerns the course to be steered and the speed at which to run in order to arrive at a specified destination at a predetermined time. This could be used in establishing a rendezvous with another boat or in predicted log or other navigation contests.

# CHAPTER18

POSITION DETERMINATION

Lines of Position • Visual Observations • Positioning Procedures • Radio & Radar Navigation • Using Depth Information • Specialized Techniques

It is your duty as skipper to make a careful judgment as to the precision and frequency with which your vessel’s position should be fixed, and then to see that these fixes are carefully obtained and recorded. This is true whether you are doing the piloting or someone else is—you can delegate the function, but not the responsibility.

The procedures described in this chapter may seem old-fashioned or out-of-date in these days of instant, highly accurate electronic navigation, primarily GPS. Navigation with a GPS receiver or chartplotter is introduced in Chapter 16, and the use of GPS to simplify calculations of the effects of current set and drift on a boat’s position, course over ground, and speed of advance is covered in Chapter 17. But remember, (1) your GPS equipment may fail; (2) your source of electrical power may be lost; or (3) the worldwide GPS system itself may fail. You must be able to navigate manually should the need arise.

This chapter will also explore how to augment visual piloting skills with radar and a depth sounder. Either one can give you good lines of position, and radar can give you highly accurate ranges.

The time-honored procedures for position determination may vary widely in practice. When you are proceeding down a narrow channel, positioning is informal and a chart plot may not be maintained. In this case, position determination is not being omitted; rather it is being done continuously by visual reference to aids to navigation. During an open ocean passage, a dead reckoning plot will be determined only three or four times each day, or even only once a day by noon sights.

Normal cruising situations in pilot waters lie between these two extremes. Cruising just offshore or in larger inland bodies of water, a skipper will usually maintain a DR plot of his track with periodic fixes, perhaps every 15 or 30 minutes, perhaps at hourly intervals.

Your ability to determine your position with appropriate accuracy under any conditions of visibility or sea is critical. Your limitations in these skills must restrict the extent of your boating activities, setting the boundaries of the waters and weather conditions that you can accept without endangering your boat or its crew.

Remember that knowledge of where you are, extended from a recent position determination, is critical if you must call for help. If another boat is in trouble, you can set a direct course to render assistance only if you are both certain of each boat’s location.

## DEFINITION OF TERMS

A line of position (LOP) is a line along which an observer can be presumed to be located—actually two lines: one “real,” one drawn on a chart; see Figure 18-01. In the absence of other information, the observer may be anywhere along the LOP. An LOP may result from an observation or measurement—from visual, electronic, or celestial sources. It may be straight or curved. A circular LOP is sometimes called a circle of position; see Figure 18-02. An LOP, in a running fix (defined below), may be “advanced” to a later time according to the movement of the vessel; or, in rare cases, it may be “retarded” to a previous time as needed.

Figure 18-01 A line of position (LOP) is a line along which the observer is located. Although a single LOP does not determine position, it does tell you where the boat is not located, and such information can be useful in itself in many situations.

Figure 18-02 A line of position can be circular as well as straight. A circular LOP results from a measure of distance from an identified object. Usually it is plotted as an arc through the most likely area of position.

A bearing is the direction toward an object from the observer. Bearings are expressed in degrees as three-digit numbers: 005°, 056°, 157°, etc. A true bearing is one measured with reference to true North. A magnetic bearing is one measured with reference to local magnetic North, and a compass bearing is one taken over a compass and affected by the compass deviation at the time it was taken. (Refer to Chapter 13 for a discussion of true, magnetic, and compass directions.)

A relative bearing is one measured with reference to the vessel’s heading. It is measured clockwise from the fore-and-aft line, with 000° as dead ahead, 090° as broad on the starboard beam, 180° as dead astern, etc.

A range consists of two objects that can be observed in line with each other and the observer—all three are on the same straight line; see Figure 18-03.

Figure 18-03 When two objects can be observed in line, this is a special LOP called a range. It is labeled only with the time of observation above the plotted line. Some range objects will have been set up specifically for that purpose, but any identifiable pair of charted objects or features can provide a range.

A fix is an accurately located position determined without reference to any assumption or estimation of prior position.

A running fix (R FIX) may also be derived from two LOPs, one of which has been advanced (or retarded) from a different time—thus introducing an element of estimation.

An estimated position (EP) is the best position obtainable short of a fix (or running fix). It is the most probable position, determined from incomplete or questionable data relating to course run, speed, current set and drift, etc.

### Lines of Position

Lines of position are the basic element of position determination. An observer lies somewhere along the length of a line of position. If two LOPs intersect, the observer must be at the intersection, which is the only place where he or she can be on both lines at once. A fix is usually determined by crossing two or more LOPs.

When LOPs are drawn on charts, they should be no longer than necessary and be clearly and consistently labeled. Labels should identify them completely, but superfluous data can be confusing. The label must specify the time the LOP was observed or measured and its basic dimension, such as direction toward or distance from the reference object.

A bearing is a line of position that has both time and direction. Time is always shown above the line of the bearing and direction below it; use plain, block letter styles. Remember to write time as a four-digit figure in the 24-hour system. Record the direction as a three-digit group with leading zeros as necessary. Follow the figures with a space and the letter “M” if the direction is magnetic; the absence of a letter indicates a true direction (i.e., the noting of “T” for true is unnecessary and redundant). Note that the degree symbol (°) is omitted since all three-digit numbers in labels are obviously directions; see Figure 18-04.

Figure 18-04 Prompt and correct labeling of lines of position is important; unlabeled or mislabeled lines cause confusion. Time is shown above the line in the 24-hour clock system. Direction is shown beneath the line as a three-digit number, with “M” added if it is a magnetic direction.

A circle of position has dimensions of time and distance and may be plotted as a full circle or an arc. Time is written above the line, and distance (and units of distance) below (which may be “inside” or “outside” the circle or arc); see Figure 18-05.

Figure 18-05 Circles of position are labeled in the same way as lines of position, with time written horizontally above the line and distance below (unit of distance may be shown). Time will be inside or outside the circle as determined by the curvature of the arc.

A range is an LOP whose direction is self-evident from the two points that establish it. In this case, the label need show only time, which is written above the range line; refer to Figure 18-03. The line need not be plotted completely through both objects of the range—draw it only long enough to make clear which two objects define it. This will minimize the need to erase lines drawn over important chart symbols.

An LOP that has been advanced from an older line is labeled with both times above it—the original time first and the time to which it has been advanced, separated by a dash; see Figure 18-06.

Figure 18-06 An advanced LOP is labeled with the original time and the time for which it was replotted. The direction remains the same and is repeated.

Label your LOPs immediately to avoid mistakes. Unlabeled lines on a chart can be a dangerous source of confusion.

### Fixes

A fix is an accurately located position. On many occasions in small-craft piloting, position will be determined by passing close by an identifiable object, often an aid to navigation. When such a fix is established, the skipper should note the time horizontally on the chart; see Figure 18-07.

Figure 18-07 An excellent, yet simple, determination of position occurs when a boat passes close to an aid to navigation or other identifiable point. Note the time on the chart written horizontally, no circle needed.

A fix that is obtained from lines of position will be the intersection of two or more such lines; see Figure 18-08. Note that the angle of intersection of two LOPs affects the accuracy of the position determination. When two lines cross at right angles (90°), an error of a couple of degrees in one or both LOPs will have the least effect. Where LOPs cross at small angles, however, an error in one or both observations or measurements will have far more serious implications; see Figure 18-09.

Figure 18-08 A fix is an accurately determined position for a vessel based on concurrently observed lines of position or other data. See Figure 18-13 for labeling.

Figure 18-09 Note the difference in position of the intersection that a change of 2° in one LOP makes when the lines cross at 90° (left) or at 30° (right).

Two lines of position should intersect as nearly as possible at right angles, and the angle should never be less than 60 degrees, if possible. A fix resulting from LOPs intersecting at angles smaller than 60 degrees may not be a fix at all and should be regarded with doubt.

Even lines that intersect at large angles will cover what are known as areas of uncertainty. While we label our lines with specific directions, we know that there may be uncertainty in each line of 2 or 3 degrees. If the uncertainty is potentially dangerous, it should be represented graphically by adding two dashed lines on either side of the LOP that define the limits of the inaccuracy. LOPs from various sources will have different levels of inaccuracy—only an experienced navigator can judge these levels.

If both questionable LOPs are drawn with their dashed lines at the maximum and minimum possible values, the dashed lines will enclose an area of uncertainty at their intersection. The area of uncertainty is not the quadrilateral enclosed by the lines but an elliptical area; it is circular only if the two LOPs cross at exactly 90 degrees; see Figure 18-10.

Figure 18-10 When both LOPs have a possible inaccuracy of several degrees, there is an area of uncertainty around the intersection point (A). This area grows as the intersection angle narrows (B). Be very cautious with intersection angles of 30°or less.

#### Using More Than Two LOPs

Whenever possible, a third line of position should be drawn to reduce the uncertainty. Of course, a fourth and fifth LOP might also be available, but this is seldom the case and almost always unnecessary.

If the observer is on all three lines of position at the same time, then they should all intersect. The more common result is that they nearly intersect, and instead of defining a point, they form a small triangle. (Theoretically the three bearings should be taken simultaneously, but in practice they can be taken in sequence, as the distance traveled by the boat in this short interval is too small to show up on the chart plot.)

The best result is obtained when all three LOPs form 60° (or 120°) angles. If this is the case, their inherent inaccuracy will have the least effect; see Figure 18-11.

Figure 18-11 An optimum set of three LOPs cross at 60° or 120° (left), but this is seldom possible. Alternatively, you might choose objects whose LOPs would cross at 90° (or as near to 90° as possible) ensuring a good fix, and adding a third LOP at about 45° or 135° as insurance, if there is time and a suitable object available for the third observation.

In practice, two bearings should be taken promptly, one after the other, spaced as closely as possible to 90 degrees, and, if time permits, a third chosen to split them as evenly as possible.

The triangle that almost always results when three LOPs are plotted is known as the triangle of position. A large triangle suggests a serious inaccuracy in at least one of the LOPs, and a check should be made on the observations for errors of reading, deviation, calculation, or plotting.

A small triangle (how small is a relative judgment depending on the proximity of danger) can be eyeballed to find its center, and this center used as the fix; see Figure 18-12.

Figure 18-12 Plotting more than two LOPs increases the accuracy of the resulting fix. If they were perfectly accurate (A), all three would intersect at the same point. However, in actual navigation they will almost always form a small triangle (B).

#### Labeling the Fix

A fix is plotted on the chart as a small circle with a dot in its center; the dot, however, should be omitted from the symbol when it is placed at the intersection of two LOPs. The word “fix” is not needed, but the position must have a label, written horizontally, that records the time of the fix; see Figure 18-13 and refer to Chapter 16, Figure 16-23. A running fix is shown with the same symbol, but the label should contain “R FIX” in addition to the time. When the fix is obtained by passing close by an aid to navigation, the aid’s symbol may take the place of the dot and circle. The usual distance off (50 to 100 yards or meters) is insignificant at most chart scales.

Figure 18-13 A fix is labeled with the time, written horizontally, but the word “fix” is not used. For a running fix, however, the label “R FIX” is added along with the time of the second observation, again written horizontally.

### The Value of a Single LOP

While a fix is typically made with two or more LOPs, don’t underestimate the value of a single LOP. Of course, a single LOP cannot tell the skipper where the boat is at the moment, but it can tell him (within its limits of accuracy) where the boat is not. This information, though lacking detail (and meaningful only in a negative sense), can nevertheless be reassuring where hazards may be close by.

Further, a single LOP can often be combined with a DR position to obtain a useful EP (estimated position). This EP is the position along the LOP that is closest to the DR position for the same time that the LOP was observed. To obtain such an EP, draw a line from the DR position, perpendicular to the LOP, until the lines intersect. An EP is marked with a square. A square is used exclusively for EPs, so the label does not have to say “EP.” Time may also be omitted because it is the same as the time that appears on the LOP or at the DR position; see Figure 18-14.

Figure 18-14 An estimated position can be obtained from a single LOP. It is the point on the LOP that is closest to the DR position for that time (left). If a beam bearing is used, the EP will be on the track line (right).

It is also possible to obtain an “EP with current.” This requires an estimate of the set and drift of the current, either from predictions or from accurate measurements of the effects of the current on the boat’s course and speed made good.

From the DR position for the specified time, an EP with current would be obtained as follows. A line is drawn representing the effect of the current during the time period since the DR track was started from the last fix. The line is drawn in the direction of the set of the current and to a length equal to the total drift. (The length of the line would be drift multiplied by the elapsed time since the last fix.) This total drift line is labeled, and from its end another line is drawn to intersect the LOP at a right angle (just as in a regular EP plot). The intersection obtained is your EP with current; see Figure 18-15.

Figure 18-15 If information about the current is available, an improved “estimated position with current” can be plotted. The offsetting effect of the current (which includes wind effects) since the start of the DR track is calculated and plotted. The nearest point on the LOP from this current-influenced point is the EP.

Running fixes, and the use of a single LOP with depth measurements, will be discussed later in this chapter.

## VISUAL PILOTING

In typical small-craft navigation, the primary source of lines of position will be visual observation. Observations will include bearings, ranges, and even horizontal and vertical angle measurements. Correct identification is essential. Although other methods and other equipment, such as GPS (covered in Chapters 16 and 17), radar bearings and distance measurements (covered later in this chapter), and depth measurements (also covered in this chapter), may also provide LOPs, visual observations are the indispensable foundation of piloting.

The aids to navigation depicted on charts comprise a system consisting of fixed and floating objects with varying degrees of reliability. A prudent boater, therefore, will not rely on any single aid to navigation, especially a floating aid, to fix his or her position.

If a navigator has a choice of objects to sight for bearings, he or she should select the nearer ones provided they would make good intersection angles on the plot. The reason is that a measured angular inaccuracy, if one exists, will be the same whether the object is near or far. However, the linear inaccuracy will be amplified as the LOP is extended over a greater distance. For example, an angular error of one degree extending to one mile will result in an error of about 100 feet (30.5m). At two miles, the error will double. In a case where a light is being observed at night over a distance of a dozen miles, a one-degree error is potentially quite serious.

### Simple Visual Bearings

Perhaps the simplest and most accurate visual observation is a bearing taken dead ahead and read from the vessel’s steering compass; see Figure 18-16. Swinging the boat off course to point it at a charted object rarely has much impact on the DR track, since the boat is held on this heading only long enough for the boat to be lined up and for the compass to settle down and be read—perhaps only 20 or 30 seconds. Of course, this is somewhat more difficult on a sailboat because the dead-ahead alignment from the helm is more likely to be obscured by the mast.

Figure 18-16 A simple, accurate way to take a bearing is to “aim” your boat directly at the sighted object and read the compass. Brief off-course swings will not affect the DR plot materially, but be sure that there are no hazards alongside your course. Correct compass bearings to true or magnetic directions before plotting them on your chart.

The skipper must be sure of his general location and of surrounding traffic so that the off-course swing can be made safely. This is a quick, accurate, and simple way to get a bearing, and has the additional advantage that it can be accomplished by the helmsman alone.

If the charted object on which a bearing is to be taken is on the beam, a swing off course to line it up with the bow may not be feasible. Perhaps a limited channel width or the presence of other vessels restricts such a deviation from the DR track. In this case, choose some part of the boat that will give you an accurate right angle from the centerline. This might be a bulkhead, a seat back, etc. While the helmsman maintains course on the DR track, the bearing taker waits until the object comes into view along this line. Such sights will determine when the object is dead abeam—either 090 or 270.

If waiting until the object comes abeam is not feasible or desirable, then the heading of the craft can sometimes be temporarily altered slightly to bring the sighted object on the beam more quickly. Should such a temporary change of heading be made, be sure that the 90 degrees is added to or subtracted from the altered compass reading at the moment the sighted object is abeam; do not use the base course.

It is extremely important to note that any bearing taken from the steering compass is a compass bearing and, as such, is subject to both deviation and variation. If you are to plot them as true bearings, you will have to correct for both (refer to Chapter 13).

In the case of the 90-degree adjustment for sightings abeam, remember that 90 degrees must be added or subtracted after, not before, the compass reading has been corrected for deviation (and for variation), because, while variation will be the same on any heading, deviation will differ from one heading to another. The deviation is found on the deviation table opposite the boat’s heading (because deviation varies with heading), not opposite the direction for the bearing.

A bearing in almost any direction can be taken by using one of several instruments: a hand-bearing compass (refer to Figure 16-07 and Figure 18-17), a pelorus (see opposite page), or a binocular or range finder with an internal compass. Care must be taken to use the value of deviation of the boat’s heading at the time of observation, not the deviation value for the direction of the bearing.

Figure 18-17 To take a reading with a hand-bearing compass, sight along the lubber line and view the compass card numbers in the small prism.

### Plotting Bearings

The direction measured for a bearing is from the boat toward the object. When the plot is being done, the position of the boat is not yet known, but it is still possible to draw the bearing line of position so that it will have the correct direction and will lead to or through the point on the chart that locates the object.

This is done by drawing a line outward from the position of the sighted object toward the observer’s position using a reciprocal of the corrected bearing. It is important to remember to correct the bearing for deviation before converting it to a reciprocal by adding or subtracting 180 degrees. (You must also correct for variation if directions are being plotted as true values.)

#### True or Magnetic Plotting

You can plot bearings, courses, and other directions as true or magnetic values, but you should be consistent in your work. There are advantages and disadvantages to both procedures. If you plot magnetic values, you must always include variation in your calculations unless you measure directions using the inner circle of a compass rose. Do not plot compass values for bearings or courses.

### Bearings without Changing Heading

Getting a bearing either dead ahead or abeam may not always be safe or convenient, especially under sail. Bearings can also be taken without changing the boat’s heading. Such bearings may involve the boat’s steering compass, a hand-bearing compass, or a pelorus.

On many boats, it may be possible to take a bearing in most directions by sighting over the steering compass. Sometimes the accuracy of such a bearing is increased by the use of sighting vanes placed over the compass, but usually the sighting can be taken across the card itself. Once again, be sure to correct for deviation and variation, and use the deviation value appropriate to the boat’s heading, not the direction of the bearing.

#### Using a Hand-bearing Compass

Very often, visual bearings are made with a hand-bearing compass; refer to Chapter 16, Figure 16-07. While such a compass is also vulnerable to deviation, the usual practice is to choose a location on board that is sufficiently distant from magnetic influences that a deviation correction is not needed. Some experimentation might be required to find a spot that provides a secure platform and is free from magnet influence. (Remember, the metal frame of your eyeglasses, a grommet in your cap, or the batteries in the flashlight you may be using to illuminate the card can affect the compass.) Readings can be plotted directly if you are working with magnetic directions, or they can be corrected by applying variation if you are plotting true directions.

#### Using a Pelorus

A pelorus can also be used to obtain bearings, usually as relative bearings; refer to Chapter 16. A pelorus can be used at any on-deck location from which the object is clearly in view and where the pelorus card can be accurately aligned with the boat’s fore-and-aft axis. In practice this might mean predetermining two or three convenient positions on deck.

A pelorus card can be adjusted (after fore-and-aft alignment) to the boat’s compass heading, and sights made directly as compass bearings, but this is less desirable than using the pelorus to read relative bearings (see next page). In all cases, compass bearings must be converted to true or magnetic values before plotting.

#### Relative Bearings

To take a relative bearing with a pelorus, the pelorus scale is set with 0° dead ahead. The helmsman is alerted and requested to steer a steady course, reading the compass continuously. Before the pelorus observation is made, the reader calls “stand by,” and as it is made, the reader calls “mark.” At his call, the helmsman notes the reading on the steering compass and calls it out to the recorder. If the steering compass reading has not been accurate, the pelorus reading must be discarded. If it is very difficult to steer a steady course, the helmsman can instead call “mark” each time he is confident of an accurate reading. The pelorus reader makes his observation at each “mark.”

A relative bearing must be corrected to a true or magnetic bearing for plotting; see Figure 18-18. First the compass reading is corrected for deviation and (if plotting in degrees true) variation, then the pelorus (or sighted) reading is added. (If the result exceeds 360, then 360 is subtracted.)

Figure 18-18 Relative bearings must be converted to true or magnetic bearings before they are plotted. The relative bearing value is added to the boat’s heading at the moment of observation; if the sum exceeds 360°, subtract 360°.

Once again, avoid a common error. Always be sure to use the deviation value appropriate to the boat’s heading—not the bearing direction.

Let’s look at the examples shown in Figure 18-18. In the first case, an observer is on a boat that is heading 040 (true) and takes a relative bearing on a buoy at 055°. To determine the true bearing of this buoy, simply add the two numbers, 40 +55 = 95; the bearing is 095°.

Here’s a more complicated example: A boat is heading 303° by compass when a relative bearing of 317° is measured. The variation for this location is 6°W and the deviation for this particular compass at 303° is 2° E. Convert the boat’s heading to true this way: 303 − 6 + 2 = 299°. The sum of the relative bearing and the true heading is 317 + 299 = 616. Subtract 360 and the true bearing is 256°.

### Ranges

Lines of position from ranges are of exceptional value in position determination. They are free from all of the magnetic effects that might cause errors in bearings taken with reference to a compass (whether sighted on the bow, across the boat, or with a pelorus).

LOPs from ranges are also much more easily obtained than bearings. No matter how small the boat or how rough the weather, if you can see both objects, you can line them up with absolute accuracy; refer to Figure 18-03. The accuracy of your LOP depends only on the accuracy of the range locations on the chart. You now have half of a very accurate fix.

Ranges fall into two groups. First, there are those that consist of two aids to navigation constructed specifically to serve as a range and are charted with standard symbols. The direction of such a range can be measured from the chart but is better determined from information in the Light Lists. However, any two charted, prominent objects can be used for ranges—ordinary aids to navigation, spires, towers, radio towers, stacks, the centers of bridges, and even clearly demarcated edges of natural features; see Figure 18-19. Be careful using natural features, because shoreline edges may change with changes in water level, and exact points may be hard to determine. If possible, avoid using buoys, as their charted locations are not as exact as those of fixed aids to navigation.

Figure 18-19 Navigators are not limited to ranges that have been established specifically as aids to navigation—many natural and man-made features make excellent incidental ranges. For example, these four stacks at Northport, Long Island, NY, provide a range that is almost exactly magnetic south.

Taking an LOP from a range requires no more than the observation of the time when your boat comes into alignment with the two objects. The LOP is plotted by lining up the symbols with a straightedge and drawing a light, solid line over the portion of the chart where your DR track or other LOP is likely to cross. The actual direction will not ordinarily be noted, but the LOP should be labeled with the time as soon as it is drawn. The range LOP can be crossed with another range or an LOP from any other source. If none is available at the time of alignment, the range line of position can be advanced at a later time and used as part of a running fix. In this case, the direction should be noted so that the advanced line can be related to the original and easily labeled.

The U.S. Coast Guard and other authorities often establish ranges to indicate the center of a hazardous narrows, dredged channel, or simply an important waterway, especially if there are strong currents to contend with. Such a range line is printed on the chart, and it is often used for direct steering rather than as an LOP. Two cautions are needed. First, a vessel traveling in the opposite direction on the range will be on a collision course. Second, a range can be followed for too great a distance into dangerous waters. Buoys will often mark the limits of such a range, but study your chart carefully to determine when to turn away from a range to avoid danger; see Figure 18-20.

Figure 18-20 Caution must be used when following a range because there is always a limit to the extent of safe water. The range line on the chart will be solid for the length for which it is to be used and dashed where it is not to be used. Often buoys or minor lights mark the beginning and end of a range-marked channel.

### Horizontal Angles

A way to obtain a fix without having to correct for compass error is to measure two horizontal angles having a common side. The two angles are taken using three objects identifiable on the chart. A sextant, normally used to measure vertical angles in celestial navigation, can be held sideways and read to a very high degree of accuracy; see Figure 18-21.

Figure 18-21 A sextant, such as the one seen above, is usually used for measuring vertical angles in celestial navigation, but it can also be used in piloting to measure horizontal or vertical angles to calculate distance off.

Horizontal angles can be plotted with a three-arm protractor; see Figure 18-22. The two measured angles are set on the outer arms in relation to the center arm. The protractor is moved on the chart until all three arms intersect the locations of their respective sighted objects, the centerline of each arm representing a line of position. The center of the protractor (the apex of both angles) is the position of the observer. You plot it by placing a pencil point though a hole.

Figure 18-22 A three-arm protractor is a special plotting instrument for finding a position using two horizontal angles—in this case the angles between a buoy and the well-defined edges of two islands. The angles are carefully set on the protractor, then it is moved about on the chart until the arms lie over their respective objects.

The same plot can be accomplished with tracing paper. After drawing the angles on the tracing paper, they are moved around in the same way until all three are intersecting the locations of their respective objects; see Figure 18-23.

Figure 18-23 You can use horizontal angles to determine position by drawing them on tracing paper. Move the paper around on the chart until the lines intersect the objects that were sighted upon. The apex of the lines is your boat’s position when the observations were taken.

Be careful when selecting the three objects to be observed; if they and the boat all lie on the circumference of a circle, no fix can be obtained. When you study Figure 18-24, you will see three sighted objects—X, Y, and Z—and an observer at both A and at B. Both observations will give the same angle values, and will do the same almost anywhere between X and Z.

Figure 18-24 The horizontal angle between Y and Z will be the same when observed from point A, point B, or anywhere else between X and Z on the circle that intersects X, Y, and Z—and the same is true of the angle between Y and X. If you’re on or near the circle that sweeps the objects sighted, you’re in a “revolver” situation. The resultant ambiguity in your fix can be cleared up with another LOP; see the text.

This situation, known as a “revolver,” can occur if the center object sighted is farther away from the observer than the other two. By selecting a center object that is either closer than the other two or equidistant with them, you can avoid an indeterminate situation.

A revolver should be avoided, but if one does develop it can be made usable by the addition of a single LOP, such as a single bearing on one of the three objects or on any other point.

The geographic coordinates of a position can be calculated from the known latitude and longitude of the three objects and the measured horizontal angles between them, but the complexity of the mathematics makes this procedure impractical for ordinary cruising.

#### Using a Horizontal Angle with a Radius

A fix can also be determined from LOPs derived from two horizontal angles that don’t share a common point. Each angle can be used to establish a circle of position.

Consider one angle at a time. There is a circle that contains both of the objects sighted upon (in measuring the horizontal angle) as well as the observer. The radius of this circle can be calculated using the distance between the sighted objects.

Here’s how to proceed. First, measure the distance between the two sighted objects on the chart. Find the sine of the measured horizontal angle using your electronic or plastic circular calculator or a trigonometric table from Bowditch. Next, multiply the sine by two and use that product to divide the distance between the objects. This is the radius of the circle on which your boat and all the sighted objects lie. (It’s easy enough to find with a calculator.)

The next step is graphical. Set a pair of dividers (or a drafting compass) to that radius (on the chart scale), and scribe two intersecting arcs, one centered on one object and one on the other. That intersection is the center of the circle along which your boat and the two sighted objects lie, so put the compass point there and scribe as much of the circular LOP as you think you need.

Do the same procedure on your second set of objects. You now have two circular LOPs, and you are at their intersection. (Actually, if you were to draw very long circular LOPs, there would be two intersections, but common sense or a third LOP will tell you which one is your position.)

While this procedure sounds complex, it is actually quite useful, especially aboard a boat in circumstances where the compass bearing is very hard to read because of rough weather. A horizontal angle greater than 90° creates a situation in which the intersection of the LOPs will be on the far side of the sighted objects and may create an invalid fix.

### Vertical Angles

All of the points (in a plane) that are a particular distance from an object lie in a circle—the distance is the radius of a circle. Such distances are often found by measuring the vertical angle from the bottom to the top of a known height, then using a simple trigonometric formula. For this reason, the heights of many man-made and natural features are carefully measured and recorded on your chart.

Such features include towers, lighthouses (usually measured to the light, not the top of the tower so as to be useful at night), radio towers, and bridges. Before you use such a recorded height, determine whether it has been measured from the base of the object or from some standard datum plane such as mean high water. Frequently, a correction will be required depending on the tidal level at the time of the observation (refer to Chapter 17).

Using a sextant or some other device for measuring sighted angles, get an accurate measure of the angle from bottom (water level or base) to top. Call this angle “A” and the known height “h.” This distance “d” can be calculated as: d = h / tan A.

Again, use the appropriate table in Bowditch or a calculator to find the tangent.

There are also specialized optical range finders, like the one shown earlier in Figure 18-17, that are adjusted to provide a reading from a scale.

### Danger Bearings & Angles

Safety can often be ensured without a complete fix. As noted previously, a single LOP has value—it can tell you where you are not. In many situations, a line of position can be chosen that will keep a boat in safe waters without defining its position.

#### Danger Bearings

A bearing line can be chosen that will divide a safe area from an unsafe area. If you stay on the correct side of such a line, your vessel will be safe; crossing it will invite danger. Take the examples shown in Figure 18-25: Shoals are indicated on the chart but not marked by any aid to navigation. A lighthouse on shore can be identified on the chart just beyond each shoal. The danger bearing is indicated, therefore, by a line that extends from the lighthouse toward your vessel, tangent to the shoal. This line is drawn on the chart and its direction is measured. The line is labeled with the direction preceded by the letters “NMT” for “not more than,” or “NLT” for “not less than.” Time is not included in the label, as this is not an observed line. Add hachures on the danger side or use a red pencil to emphasize the line’s importance.

Figure 18-25 A danger bearing can be used to avoid an unmarked hazardous area. In A above, any bearing on object X that is more than 337° indicates danger. In sketch B above, the opposite is true—a bearing less than 008° indicates danger.

As the vessel approaches the area, a series of observations is made on the lighthouse (or whatever object was chosen). It should be beyond the danger area and on the same side of the boat. If the shoal lies to port, then any bearing on the lighthouse (or chosen object) greater than the danger bearing means that the boat has not yet crossed from unsafe to safe waters. Extra care should be taken until the bearing decreases below the NMT value.

If the hazard were to starboard, the opposite would apply in relation to the NLT value.

Danger bearings are not always possible. They require a prominent object (which could be natural) that can be identified on the chart. It should be beyond the danger area and on the same side of the boat.

#### Horizontal Danger Angles

As we have seen, a horizontal angle measured between two objects (identifiable on the chart) defines a circle of position, or circular LOP. In Figure 18-26, left, an observer at either X or Y would measure the same angle between point A and point B. He would also measure the same angle at any point along that segment of the circular arc. If the observer were on the other side of the center of the circle, at X’ or Y’, or at other points along that segment, a constant (but different) angle would be observed. Note that the angle will be greater than 90 degrees in the first case (observer and objects on the same side of the circle), and less than 90 degrees in the second case; see Figure 18-26, right.

Figure 18-26 The points at which there is a constant angle between the lines of sight to two objects form a circle as shown above. The angle between the lines to A and B is the same at X and Y, and all other points on the circle.

Such a circle becomes very useful as a vessel approaches a hazard. It can establish a boundary between positions of safety and danger. When such a circular LOP is established from a horizontal angle, it is known as a horizontal danger angle. A single horizontal danger angle is used to avoid a danger area such as an unmarked shoal.

When you’re passing a shoal between you and the shore, the problem is how to stay far enough offshore to avoid the shoal. Find two prominent, identifiable objects that lie on the other side of the shoal from the area of safety. There’s no need to draw the circle. Measure the angle on the chart from the most seaward point of the shoal to the chosen objects. This is the horizontal danger angle, shown in Figure 18-27. As you approach the shoal, frequent measurements of the horizontal angle between the two objects will reveal whether or not you are standing outside the danger area. Angles less than the danger angle indicate that you are on a circular arc of a radius that is greater than the radius of the arc on which the danger lies. In other words, you’re farther offshore than the tip of the shoal—and you are safe.

Figure 18-27 The horizontal angle between A and B is frequently measured as the boat proceeds along the track line toward the hazardous area. Any angle less than 55° means that the boat is in safe waters.

On the other hand, if the measured horizontal angle becomes greater than the danger angle, you are closer inshore than the tip of the shoal and may be in danger.

It is preferable to measure the angles with a sextant, as you will have to take frequent and accurate measurements, but they can also be determined by taking either relative or compass bearings on the objects.

The same technique can be used to pass inshore of a danger area—just make sure that your angles remain greater than the angle of the threatening extent of the shoal; see Figure 18-28.

Figure 18-28 A horizontal danger angle can be used to pass between an offshore hazardous area and the shore itself. Here we see that the measured horizontal angle must be greater than the measured horizontal danger angle of 40°.

#### Double Horizontal Danger Angles

The technique described above can be used to establish two horizontal danger angles where the problem is to pass safely between two offshore hazards. The principle is the same, as you will note from Figure 18-29. The safe angle lies between the upper and lower danger limits.

Figure 18-29 Two horizontal danger angles can be used to pass safely between two unmarked hazardous areas. The frequently measured angle must be between a minimum and maximum value—in the situation above, not less than 48° but not more than 76°.

#### Vertical Danger Angles

Where only a single object is available, it may be possible to use a vertical angle to establish a boundary between safe and hazardous waters. Using the vertical angle technique, a circle is drawn that has the identifiable object of known height at its center and encloses all of the hazards. The radius is measured from the chart and used in the formula d = h / tan A, where “d” is distance, “h” is height, and tan A is the tangent of the angle. The angle itself can be found with a calculator or looked up in Bowditch, which also provides a table to substitute for the whole calculation (Table 15, 1995 or 2002 editions). The danger circle is labeled with the vertical danger angle.

On approach, a series of vertical angle measurements is taken, and as these values approach the danger angle, course is altered to maintain or decrease the measured values. If the angle were maintained, the course would describe a circular arc around the sighted object (outside the area of hazard). A decreasing angle would mean that the boat was getting farther away from the sighted object and also from the hazardous area.

Vertical angles may also be used in pairs in a manner similar to that described for horizontal angles. Two vertical angles can be used to define a safe passage between two hazards, one indicating the inshore limit and the other indicating the offshore limit. Range finders can also be used in this situation; refer to Figure 18-17 and see below.

### Using Range Finders

Coincident (split image) reticle and LIDAR (light detection and ranging) range finders are useful on boats. Coincident range finders present two images of a sighted object that are fused into one by adjusting the range control knob. Distance is then read from the knob’s calibration marks. A reticle range finder superimposes a graduated vertical scale on a distant object of known height. LIDARs send a pulse of laser light toward a distant object and measure the time it takes for the reflected laser energy to return to the device. Measurement ranges can be as far as 1,500 yards (1,370 meters) to reflective targets and 400 yards (365 meters) to nonreflective objects such as flags.

## POSITIONING PROCEDURES

Knowing where you are at all times is fundamental to boating safety. A fix is the best statement of position and should be obtained as often as possible. Of lesser significance, but not without value, are running fixes and estimates of position.

### Basic Fixes

A basic fix is obtained by crossing two lines of position, and a third LOP is desirable. Such a fix assumes that the observations or measurements for these LOPs are made simultaneously, but the usual situation on a small boat is that there is only one bearing-taker. Observations are taken sequentially rather than simultaneously, but if they are taken quickly, the distance traveled between them is negligible and too small to be plotted on a chart. Adherence to the procedures described here will minimize the error from sequential observations.

As the boat moves along its course, a bearing angle will change. Those on the beam will change more rapidly than those on the bow or stern; bearings of closer objects will change more rapidly than those of distant objects. To obtain the most accurate fix from two LOPs, deal first with the object whose bearing will change slowly—the one that is farthest forward or aft. Then take a sight on the second, faster-changing object and finally, do a check on the first. You now have three bearings on two objects. Plot them by using the average of the two bearings on the slowly changing object and the single bearing on the faster-changing object. If circumstances permit only two sightings, take the slowly changing one first.

#### Improving Your Fix

If you are able to sight three objects, take them in order of rate of change—the slower-changing ones first—and consider using the averaging technique if you are able. The time of the fix should be the approximate middle of the sequence. At typical cruising speeds and chart scales, a difference of a minute or two will not be significant. At 12 knots, for example, a boat will travel 0.2 miles in one minute; on a 1:80,000 scale chart, that’s a distance of less than 3/16 of an inch.

As described in Chapter 16, there are generally accepted standards of precision for the description of position. If geographic coordinates are used, latitude and longitude (in that sequence) are stated to the nearest tenth of a minute on charts with scales of 1:50,000 or smaller, and to the nearest second on charts of larger scale.

If the position is stated with respect to some aid to navigation or landmark, direction from that point is given to the nearest degree (true) and distance to the nearest tenth of a mile.

### The Running Fix

In some cases it is possible to get a good sighting on one object, but no second object is available. In this situation a standard two-LOP fix is impossible, but a running fix (R FIX) can be used instead. A running fix is usually not as reliable because it incorporates an element of dead reckoning rather than simple observation.

The technique is to observe and plot the single LOP that is available. Some time later, after the vessel has traveled a known distance, that plotted LOP will be advanced (or retired) to a new position on the chart. Think of the LOP sweeping along across the water, without changing its angle, as your boat moves forward. To complete the running fix at a later time, a second LOP is plotted from a sighting on the same object or a new object and the “old” LOP is advanced to a new position—the position it would have reached in the period between the time it was sighted and the time the second LOP was sighted according to the speed and direction of the boat. You will note the dependence on an accurate measure of the speed and direction of the vessel in the intervening time.

#### Advancing an LOP

Here is how the technique is actually accomplished. The first LOP is observed and plotted, its time and direction carefully noted. A DR track is maintained. At a later time, a second sighting on the same object or some other object is made and plotted, time and direction recorded.

The “old” LOP must be “advanced” to a new position according to the DR track, so a point is selected somewhere on the older LOP and moved forward in the direction of the boat’s travel for a distance representing the distance covered since the first sighting was observed. A new line is drawn through that advanced point parallel to the old LOP. This new, advanced LOP is labeled as soon as it is drawn with the original time followed by a dash, the new time, and the original direction. The point where the advanced LOP crosses the LOP of the second observation is the position of the boat at the time of the second observation—the running fix; see Figure 18-30.

Figure 18-30 A line of position is advanced by moving forward any point on it an amount equal to the boat’s motion during the time interval, and redrawing the LOP through the advanced point. The intersection of this line and the new LOP for the given time is a runningfix.

Sometimes, the LOP is an arc of a circle, such as when a vertical angle is used to establish distance away from an observed object. In that case, the point chosen to advance the old LOP to the new position is the center of the circular arc. The advanced LOP is scribed with the same radius as the old, but on an advanced center point; see Figure 18-31.

Figure 18-31 When a circular LOP has been used (as with a distance-off measurement), it can be advanced by moving its center by the same distance and in the same direction as the movement of the boat according to the DR track. The line C-C’ is equal and parallel to the track line segment between the two DR positions.

If the track of the boat in the interval between sightings is a straight line of constant speed, the DR is simple. However, the boat may vary both direction and speed between observations. This complicates the DR track, of course, but it does not change the principle of advancing an LOP. Typically, the DR plot would be maintained through these variations of speed and direction. When it is time to advance the point on the LOP, it is advanced along a line parallel to and equal in length to a line drawn between the original DR position and the DR position at the time of the running fix; see Figure 18-32.

Figure 18-32 When advancing an LOP, you must take into account all changes of course and speed during the time interval. The net effect is determined by drawing a light dashed line (X-Y) between the two DR positions that define the time interval. You then advance the LOP for the length and direction of this line on a dashed line parallel to it.

#### The Effect of Current

Current may also play a role in the advancement of the LOP. If current is predictable, the advanced point is moved according to the DR track, and then offset by the appropriate direction and distance according to the estimated drift and set of the current—both calculations using the elapsed time between observations; see Figure 18-33.

Figure 18-33 If the current is known or can be estimated, the advancement of an LOP can be made more accurately if that effect is included as shown above.

In all cases, a fix that is obtained from two simultaneous observations is preferable to a running fix, because the accuracy of the original LOP can only be decreased by errors and uncertainties in the DR data for the boat’s speed and direction during the interval between the first and second observations. When current is also a factor, this data becomes less and less certain.

Obviously, increasing the length of the time between observations decreases accuracy. Yet enough time must be allowed to pass in order to pick up a second object, or to achieve a substantial angular change for the second observation of the same object.

In piloting, this interval is rarely more than 30 minutes, while in celestial navigation on the high seas, the interval might be as much as several hours, since inaccuracy is less dangerous in those circumstances.

It is a matter of judgment whether a DR track should be interrupted and restarted on the basis of a running fix.

#### Observations on a Single Object

The running fix can be one form of observation on a single object (a running fix can also use two objects at different times), but there are other techniques for dealing with one available object. Successive observations of one object can use a method of bow-and-beam bearings, doubling the angle on the bow, two bearings and run between, or two relative bearings. Each of these different techniques is described in detail in this section.

Bow-and-Beam Bearings This technique uses two sightings that are easy to make with good accuracy even if no special tool is available—a 45-degree sighting off the bow and a 90-degree beam sighting off the same side. Both can be made with crude tools, even a 45-degree triangular drafting square, or no tools at all—just objects on deck that define a 45-degree and a 90-degree angle with the centerline. For this reason, bow-and-beam bearings can often be made by the helmsman single-handedly.

As the object comes into view, the observer waits for it to reach the 45-degree alignment. As usual, the time is recorded. Course and speed are maintained. The same object is observed when it reaches the 90-degree alignment and the time is then recorded; see Figure 18-34.

Figure 18-34 With only simple tools, and without an additional person to take bearings, a helmsman can determine his position. The time is noted when the sighted object bears 45 degrees on either bow. The boat continues on with steady course and speed. The time is noted when the same object is broad on the beam. The distance traveled between A and B is calculated, and is equal to the distance that the boat was off the object, B to L at the time when it was abeam.

Picture a 45-degree drafting triangle—the long edge corresponds to the LOP of the first (45-degree) observation. The other two edges are the same length. One of these edges is the LOP of the second observation and the other is the DR track of the boat between observations.

You have recorded the time of the first observation and of the second, so you can calculate how far the boat traveled in the interval. That traveled distance is equal to the distance from the object at the time of the second observation. You now have a distance and an LOP, so you can plot a fix.

Doubling the Angle on the Bow The technique of doubling the angle on the bow makes use of a similar principle as the bow-and-beam method, but it requires that relative angles be accurately measured, which means that two people are usually required.

As the boat approaches an observed object, a relative bearing is taken. Let’s assume that the bearing is 20 degrees to port. The boat continues along a DR track until the observed object bears 40 degrees to port. The time interval and the distance traveled are calculated. Again, as with the bow-and-beam method, the distance traveled between observations is equal to the distance from the object at the time of the second observation; see Figure 18-35.

Figure 18-35 If two observations are made so that the second relative bearing is twice that of the first, as measured from the bow to either starboard or port, the distance to the object at the time of the second bearing is the same as the distance made good between the sightings—L to B equals A to B.

There’s an advantage with this method in that the boat’s position can be fixed before the object is abeam. A hazard that may be present can more easily be avoided because the boat’s course can be projected forward from the early known position. Typically, a headland can be sighted and given a wide berth well in advance.

Two Relative Bearings A more generalized solution from two relative bearings can be used. Table 18 of Bowditch uses two items of information—the angle between the course and the first bearing (the first relative bearing) and the difference between the course and the second bearing (the second relative bearing). Columns of the table are in terms of the first item, and lines of the table are in terms of the second item above; the interval between tabular entries is 2 degrees in both cases; see Figure 18-36.

Figure 18-36 Distance off at the time of a second bearing, L-B, and distance off when abeam, L-C, can be found by using multiplying factors to the distance run, A-B, between the taking of the two bearings. These factors for various pairs of angles are given in Bowditch, Table 18. An extract of this table is shown at right.

For any combination of the two relative bearings within the limits of Table 18, two factors will be found. The first number is a factor by which the distance run between the bearings is multiplied to obtain the distance away from the sighted object at the time of the second bearing. The second factor of the same entry in this table is the multiplier to be used to determine the distance off when the object is abeam, assuming, of course, that the same course and speed are maintained.

Two-Bearings-and-Run-Between Yet another method is available when only a single object can be observed. In this procedure, a bearing is taken on the object as before. The boat proceeds along its course. A second bearing is taken after the angle has changed by at least 30 degrees. The second bearing may be taken either before or after the object has passed abeam. A distance run between observations is calculated from the boat’s DR track.

Both LOPs are plotted along with the course of the boat. A pair or dividers is opened to a span representing the distance run between observations. Then the dividers are placed in such a way as to have a point touching each LOP and have the line between them parallel to the boat’s course. In other words, the boat’s course is moved “sideways” until the distance traveled exactly spans the decreasing distance between the two LOPs. The divider points now indicate the boat’s position at the time of each observation; see Figure 18-37.

Figure 18-37 If two bearings are taken on a single object as a boat passes by, and these are plotted on the chart, only one point can be found on each bearing line where the boat’s course and distance traveled will make a good fit. The second point is the boat’s position at the time of the second observation. (The dashed lines on the chart extract above are shown only to illustrate how an improperly placed track line would be either too short or too long; they would not be used in actual piloting.)

Note that the distance run must be the distance over the bottom—suitable corrections having been made already for current. Accuracy depends on the usual factors, but it also depends on the accuracy of the course steered in the time interval between the observations. The net effect is to make this procedure somewhat less desirable than those described earlier.

## RADIO DIRECTION FINDING

Several decades ago, radio direction finding (RDF) was a commonly used piloting technique for offshore cruising. The U.S. Coast Guard and comparable agencies in other countries operated hundreds of marine radiobeacon stations, and offshore cruising boats were equipped with RDF receivers. Large ships were also fitted with radio direction finders, often automatic (ADF) models. Bearings were taken of radiobeacons located onshore and on offshore aids to navigation; these were plotted on charts in a manner similar to visual bearings. Aeronautical radiobeacons were shown on charts if they were located so that they could aid in marine navigation. Bearings could also be taken on AM broadcast stations, and charts often had symbols marking the location of transmitting antennas. The fixes so obtained were less accurate than visual fixes, but had the advantage that they could be obtained at night and in conditions of reduced visibility, such as fog; they could also be obtained at distances far in excess of visual range. Bearings could also be taken on the radio signals of other vessels; this capability often aided rescue craft in “homing” in on a scene of distress.

With the switch to VHF and single sideband (SSB) for communications, and the use of satellite systems for navigation, radio direction finding as described above fell into disuse. It would be very rare indeed to find an RDF set on a modern recreational or commercial small craft. The U.S. Coast Guard has decommissioned radiobeacons. The call signs and frequencies of many AM broadcast stations and the locations of their transmitting antennas are still printed on charts, as are some aeronautical radiobeacons. However, these are not now used for direction finding for lack of onboard equipment—and the availability of better navigation systems.

### VHF Radio Direction Finding

Radio direction finding has survived into the modern age in a specialized form. Automatic RDFs are available that indicate the direction of a received VHF signal to an accuracy of about 5°. Such sets are commonly found on Coast Guard utility boats and cutters and on some assistance-towing craft; see Figure 18-38. These are normally used in a “homing” mode to expedite the locating of a vessel requiring help; vessel operators are often asked to give a “long count from one to ten and back” while a bearing is taken. Coast Guard and other enforcement units can use a VHF ADF to locate a source of interfering signals, such as a stuck microphone button. Bearings may also be taken on the 121.5 MHz signals of an EPIRB (if the ADF model being used covers this frequency); refer to Chapter 20.

Figure 18-38 Automatic VHF radio direction finders (ADFs) will often be seen on assistance towboats that use them for locating craft in distress or needing assistance generally.

VHF direction-finding antennas may also be seen on some sport fishermen that are homing on radio transmissions of vessels reporting successful fishing activities. It must be noted, though, that such actions are illegal. The use of intercepted radio messages not addressed to you for your own benefit is prohibited by federal law (47 USC 605 and 18 USC 2511) and FCC regulation (47 CFR 80.88).

The Coast Guard does not operate any radiobeacons on the VHF band, but the continuous transmissions of the NOAA weather stations provide a good signal for determining an LOP; the range would be the same as in regular reception of weather information, with an accuracy of 5 to 10 degrees. You must know the location of the transmitting antenna and have that plotted on the chart you are using; this information might be found in marine forecasts, on NOAA weather radio websites, or from local weather forecast offices. This will normally provide only one LOP, but in limited areas it may be possible to receive two weather stations and, therefore, to obtain a rough fix. Coast Guard stations and Marine Operators normally have multiple antenna sites, and it is not possible to use their signals for taking bearings for lack of knowledge of which antenna was currently being used.

Equipment for VHF direction finding may be either a self-contained unit or an add-on for a conventional communications transceiver. In the latter case, no modification is required of the basic radio, and it can continue to be used for its normal functions. But in both cases, a direction-finding antenna as in Figure 18-38 is required to sense the direction from which the VHF signals are coming; an automatic switch protects the RDF unit when the set transmits. The display can be either the relative bearing of the source of the signals, accurate to about 10 degrees, or the crosstrack error for heading directly to the other vessel.

A boat equipped with a properly installed VHF/DSC radio can use digital hailing to call other vessels and shore stations. If the hailing call includes the vessel’s position, the receiving radio will display the MMSI and position of the caller and plot the position and identification of the calling station on a chartplotter. (See Chapter 20.)

## RADAR PILOTING

The features and capabilities of radar are introduced and discussed in Chapter 16. Radar serves two purposes on board ships and boats. Although often thought of as a collision-avoidance device, radar can be an essential tool in navigation. Radar has a unique advantage in navigation in that a single instrument can measure both direction and distance to moving and still targets—and can do so under any condition of visibility. Excellent detailed information on radar can be found in NGA Publication No. 1310, Radar Navigation and Maneuvering Board Manual (now available only in digital format on the Internet at the NGA Maritime Safety Information Division website, https://msi.nga.mil/Publications).

Radar measurements of direction are not as precise as those made visually, but radar can almost always make a measurement despite fog, light rain, or darkness. Heavy rain can decrease and may even prevent radar from detecting targets.

On the other hand, as mentioned in Chapter 16, measurements of distance are quite precise and accurate—much more so than vertical sextant measurements or optical range-finder readings.

Direction and distance fixes determined with radar are used in much the same manner as LOPs from visual sources. There are three different procedures for obtaining a position by radar; they are, in descending order of accuracy: radar measurement of distance to two objects, as in Figure 18-39; bearing on one object with a corresponding radar distance to that object, as in Figure 18-40; and two radar bearings. When the opportunity exists, an excellent combination is a visual direction LOP and a radar distance to the same object. Any fix involving radar is labeled with time and “RADAR.” Radar distances can also be used in the manner described for vertical angles in order to avoid unmarked hazardous areas.

Figure 18-39 Radar ranges are more precise than radar bearings. When getting a position from radar alone, the best fix will be from the use of distances to two (or more) objects that can be identified on the radar display and on the chart.

Figure 18-40 Radar is an excellent piloting tool, as it can provide both direction and distance information on a single object. A fix from a radar observation is thus plotted as a line and an arc, with the fix labeled with the time and the block lettering “RADAR.” If the direction information is from a visual bearing, the fix is more accurate.

Radar observations of isolated objects such as buoys, offshore lighthouses, etc. are usually unambiguous. When the radar target is onshore, however, some identification problems may arise; there must be positive identification of the object on both the radar display and the chart.

The capabilities of LCD radar displays make radar piloting more convenient and accurate than ever. See Chapter 16 for a discussion of the use of electronic bearing lines (EBLs) for taking bearings and variable range markers (VRMs) for obtaining ranges. These features are now standard on radar units. There is a lot to be said for a device that can show you accurate bearings and ranges to shorelines, prominent features, and aids to navigation and detect other vessels that are out there with you in the night or fog. Some mariners consider radar even more useful than GPS—but modern multi-function displays that overlay radar imagery on a digital chart (see Figure 16-37) or display the two side by side on a split screen (see Figure 16-55) make it ever more convenient to benefit from both.

Figure 18-41 Many electronic chartplotters can also display radar, engine information, and fishfinder data. See also Chapter 16.

## USING DEPTH INFORMATION

The depth of water at a vessel’s location is valuable piloting information. A single depth reading cannot tell a boater where he is, but it can tell him where he is not. If an accurate depth reading is 26 feet, you may be at any number of places that have a 26-foot depth, but you are not at a place that has significantly greater or less depth. When sufficient depth data have been obtained and have been corrected for the height of tide, they can be used for positive position determination in combination with an LOP from another source, or on their own.

As discussed in Chapter 16, most depth sounders display the depth from the bottom of the water to the transducer, which is normally located a few feet below the water line. This distance must be added to get the depth of the water from the surface, the information needed for piloting. Some models, however, can have the display reading offset so the reading indicates the water depth below the keel, or preferably, depth from the surface, better information for use in piloting. Remember that depth figures on charts are for conditions at mean lower low water.

#### Depth Information & a Single Line of Position

Given a bottom with relatively uniform slope, it may be possible to get position information with depth and a single LOP. Typically this would be a beam bearing and a single depth reading. The LOP is plotted, then a point along the line is found that matches the depth indication on the chart, corrected for tidal stage; see Figure 18-42. Such a position should be regarded only as an estimated position and marked with a square symbol. If there are two or more locations along the LOP having this depth, you will not be able to estimate your position.

Figure 18-42 A single LOP can sometimes be combined with depth information to provide an estimated position (EP). The LOP shown above is a beam bearing. A depth reading of 31 feet indicates that the estimated position is somewhat inshore of the DR track.

In some instances a rough estimate of the boat’s position can be obtained by matching a series of depth readings—one that corresponds to the density of depth figures on the chart in question. Mark your depth readings on tracing paper and move the paper around on the chart, keeping the line of soundings parallel to a line representing the direction of your course steered while the soundings were made. Look for the best match between your series, corrected for tidal stage, and a series on the chart. Don’t expect to get an exact concurrence; see Figure 18-43.

Figure 18-43 A series of soundings can be plotted on a piece of tracing paper, each depth noted with time and spaced according to the boat’s movement over the bottom. The tracing paper is then moved about on the chart until as good a match as possible is made between the measured depths and the depths shown on the chart. Remember to correct for the state of the tide.

This technique is not suited to shorelines foul with offshore rocks and areas of irregular or uniform depth. Confirmation of position cannot be positive, but certain denial can be useful.

#### Fathom Curve Piloting

When cruising over a bottom of uniform slope, piloting can be simplified by choosing a depth curve that follows a safe path. The boat may be steered manually to track the depth contour or automatically guided along the contour by an autopilot. Don’t use this method when there is any chance of meeting hazards by covering more ground than anticipated or by distorting the curve at sudden, sharp changes in direction.

### Currents & Piloting

Changes in depth resulting from tidal action cause a horizontal movement of water. A vessel thus travels in a body of water that is itself moving with respect to the bottom. This motion of the water—current—must be considered in determining a vessel’s position. The effect of currents on the piloting of boats is covered in Chapter 17.

## SPECIALIZED TECHNIQUES

Beyond the basic techniques described in the preceding pages, as well as in Chapter 17 in the discussion of currents and piloting, there are many other specialized techniques that are useful in specific situations. These techniques should not be regarded as shortcuts. Their use requires a thorough understanding of principles, and they should not be approached until the basics have been learned.

Although the bow-and-beam technique has already been covered earlier in this chapter, you should know that there are other pairs of bearings that are not as easily obtained, but are easily used to plot a fix.

### Special Pairs of Bearings

The following sets of bearings have a relationship to each other such that the run between the first bearing and the second will nearly equal the distance away from the sighted object when it is passed abeam:

20°-30°

21°-32°

22°-34°

23°-36°

24°-39°

25°-41°

27°-46°

29°-51°

30°-54°

31°-56°

32°-59°

34°-64°

35°-67°

36°-69°

37°-71°

38°-74°

39°-77°

40°-79°

41°-81°

43°-86°

44°-88°

Note that these are pairs of relative bearings to port as well as to starboard. In the preceding table, “20°-30°” can be either relative bearings 020° and 030°, or 340° and 330°, “31°-56°” can be either RB 031° and 056°, or RB 329° and 304°, etc.

### The Seven-Eighths Rule

If the observations are made when the relative bearings are 30° and 60° on either bow, simple calculations will give two useful items of information. The distance run between the observations is equal to the distance to the object at the time of the second bearing (remember doubling the angle on the bow). Also, this same distance multiplied by ⅞ (or more precisely, 0.866) is the distance that the boat will be off from the sighted object when it is broad on the beam, provided that the vessel’s course has not changed; see Figure 18-44.

Figure 18-44 The “seven-eighths rule” is a special application of doubling the angle on the bow. If 30° and 60° are chosen as the first and second relative bearings, we know two things—the distance away at the second bearing is equal to the distance made good since the first bearing, and the distance off when abeam of the object will be seven-eighths of the distance between the first and second bearings.

### The Seven-Tenths Rule

A comparable situation to the seven-eighths rule earlier is one in which the relative bearings are 22.5° and 45° to port or starboard. In this case, as before, the distance away from the sighted object is equal to the distance run between bearings, but the multiplier to determine distance off when the object is abeam is 0.7.

### To Cross or Not to Cross

When determining the relative motion of another boat, it is necessary either to convert relative bearings to compass (or true) bearings, or to maintain a steady course. In practice, it is easier to maintain a steady course and observe the change in relative bearings. The actual relative bearing is far less important than the direction and rate of change.

What we want to know in any crossing situation is: Will we cross ahead or astern, or will we collide? Because we are interested in relative and not absolute motions, it is convenient to think of our own boat as being stationary.

We have three basic situations:

• The relative bearing of the other boat moves ahead (or toward our bow).

• The relative bearing of the other boat moves aft.

• The relative bearing of the other boat does not move at all.

The first situation, the other boat passing ahead, is shown in versions A and B in Figure 18-45. The successive positions of the two boats show a steadily decreasing bearing. Version A shows the boats in absolute motion and version B shows how it looks from our own boat if we imagine it to be stationary.

Figure 18-45 Shown here are two views of the same crossing situation. An observer directly overhead would see version A, while version B suggests the view from our own craft—the one that appears to be stationary. Crossing situations are much easier to predict if we imagine our own boat to be stationary and the other boat to be moving relative to our own.

The line connecting the two boats in version B is the line of relative motion, the course and distance traveled by the other boat in relation to our own. Provided both boats maintain course and speed, it is a straight line. In this situation, when the line of relative motion is extended, it passes the bow of our “stationary” boat; therefore, the other boat following that line will cross ahead. The distance x is the minimum distance that will separate the two boats in this case. It occurs at the closest point of approach (CPA).

In the second case, shown in Figure 18-46, versions C and D cover the situation when the relative bearing moves aft. The line of relative movement passes aft, and so will the other boat.

Figure 18-46 The other boat was going to cross ahead of our own in Figure 18-45. We could make this prediction because its relative bearing moved toward our bow. Here in versions C and D, the other craft’s relative bearing moves aft. We know it will pass astern. In both cases, the separation at the closest point of approach is the distance x.

If the relative bearing does not change, the line of relative motion will pass through our boat’s position. You might say that the CPA is zero, but you would be more likely to say “He’s going to hit us!”

It is important to note that these illustrations are not actual chart plots of the boats. The position of the other boat cannot be plotted unless distance and bearing information were available, and this is unlikely unless you are using radar.

The significance here is that bearing information only, which is available to any skipper, will indicate how the two boats will converge and whether they will collide. The separation at CPA cannot actually be known unless a plot is made, but this is not significant.

#### Crossing Situations

The rules developed from the observations covered above are as follows:

• Maintain a reasonably steady course and speed.

• Observe the relative bearing of the other boat only when you are on your specified compass course. You must be on the same course each time you take a relative bearing.

• Watch the other boat for changes in course or speed that would obviously change the relative motion.

• If the relative bearing moves ahead, the other boat will pass ahead. If the relative bearing moves aft, the boat will pass astern. If the relative bearing is steady, there is a very real danger of collision; see versions E and F in Figure 18-47.

Figure 18-47 In this crossing situation, versions E and F, the relative bearing remains constant—unless one craft or the other alters course or speed, they will collide. The line of relative motion passes through our boat and there is “no separation” at the point of closest approach.

#### Offsetting Effects of Current or Wind

Relative bearings can also be taken to help in compensating for the effects of offsetting currents or wind. In versions G and H of Figure 18-48, the skipper has put his boat on a course that he believes will put a buoy close aboard and avoid a shoal. At the time of the first bearing (“0 minutes”) the buoy bears 340° relative. Five minutes later, the relative bearing is 350°. It is clear that the boat is being set down more than expected and that the line of relative motion of the buoy will pass ahead of the boat (i.e., the boat will pass on the shoal side). If the bearing on the buoy remained steady, the boat would pass close to it, and if the bearing shifted gradually away from the bow, the skipper would know that he would clear the shoal safely. In Figure 18-48, version G shows the problem in terms of the boat moving relative to the buoy, while in version H, the boat is considered to be stationary and the relative motion shown is that of the buoy. Note that the lines of relative motion in each case are parallel to each other, equal in length and opposite in direction.

Figure 18-48 A plot of relative motion is also useful when the other object is stationary. In this situation, we can use the plot to determine whether we will leave the buoy to port or to starboard if we make no change in course or speed. In version G, our motion is relative to the buoy. In version H, its “motion” is relative to us.

### Deliberate Course Offsets

A very useful technique in making a landfall confidently is to use a deliberate course offset to ensure that you miss your target on a known side. When you lay your course, you set it decidedly to one side of your objective. The advantage of this procedure lies in the fact that when you do not arrive at your destination, you know which way to turn. If you had aimed directly at your destination but failed to arrive there due to unpredicted current or steering errors, you would not be sure whether it lay on your port or starboard bow. With a deliberate offset, you can make a confident alteration of course, usually parallel to the shoreline.

##### A SAILOR’S EYE

One of the easiest ways to acquire what is often referred to as a “sailor’s eye” is to learn the simple but important principle of relative motion. For example, you find that your boat is converging on another boat that has the right of way. If you hold your course and speed, will you clear? What if your sailboat is on port tack and must yield right of way to a starboard tack boat? Do you hold and clear ahead, or pass under its stern? You have laid a course for a buoy, making allowances for current: Have you made the right allowance?

Relative motion is simply the motion of two boats in relation to each other. A boat approaching you on an opposite parallel course at 5 knots while you are making 4 knots has a relative motion of 9 knots. When meeting, if the skipper of the other boat turns to run alongside your boat to chat, your relative motion will be 1 knot, and you will see his boat going slightly faster than yours.

The relative bearing of an object can be estimated within 5 or 10 degrees with practice. When the direction of your own boat changes, the relative bearing also changes, though its true bearing remains the same. For example, if you are on a course of 050° true and sight an object bearing 090° relative, the true bearing of the object will be 140° (50 + 90). If you change your course by coming left to a course of 020°, the relative bearing of the object will now be 120°. But the true bearing remains the same at 140° (20 + 120).

If a boat’s heading changes, the relative bearing of an object is changed by the same amount. From the situation at A to that at B, the true heading of the boat has changed from 050° to 020°. The relative bearing has changed by the same amount, from 090° to 120°. Note: the sum of the heading and relative bearing remains constant (disregarding any forward boat movement).

Let us say, for example, that after several hours of trolling, drifting, and circling around, your position is uncertain. Just as you decide that your fishing luck has run out and it’s time to head back to Block Island, the fog closes in. Your best position estimate is that you are east of Bell Buoy 1, which is marked as point B in Figure 18-49. You believe that you are somewhere near point A on the chart.

Figure 18-49 If you fail to make your predicted landfall, which way should you turn? To avoid this dilemma, make a large, deliberate “error” to one side or the other; then the choice is clear.

The solution to your problem is a deliberate offset north of the harbor entrance, which is marked by lighted beacon “3.” For one thing, you think this offset will take you close to the off-lying bell buoy, and if you see or hear it you will know where you are. But even if there were no buoy, there is still merit in laying the course decidedly off to one side of the ultimate objective—Block Island Harbor.

Suppose you lay your course A-B to the bell buoy and miss it by ⅛ mile to the north. When you pick up the 3-fathom (18-foot) curve at G, you know you are north of the harbor—because you would have picked it up much sooner if you were south of the harbor entrance.

Had you missed the bell buoy by ⅛ mile to the south and picked up the 3-fathom curve west of D, you would still be able to follow the curve southeastward to lighted beacon “3,” deriving added assurance of your general position north of the harbor when you find depths holding generally at 3 fathoms on your course southeastward. If your calculations were completely wrong and you ran southeastward from any point below the harbor, depths would increase.

Let us consider, still in reference to Figure 18-49, what would have happened if you had laid a course directly for lighted beacon “3” and had missed your objective, E, by ¼ mile to the south. Picking up the 3-fathom curve at F, you could not be sure whether you were north or south of the entrance.

Your first conclusion might be that, since you have run a few minutes overtime before reaching the 3-fathom curve, you are north of the harbor. But don’t forget that you didn’t accurately know your starting point. Suppose you had been several minutes eastward of where you thought you were when the fog set in. In this event, the additional few minutes’ running time before reaching the 3-fathom curve would tell you nothing.

On the assumption that you are indeed somewhat north of the harbor, you turn south, proceeding slowly and carefully. A few minutes pass, but still no beacon or harbor entrance. How far to continue? That beacon or the entrance breakwater may be just ahead, obscured by the fog. On the other hand, doubt creeps in. You couldn’t have been that far off in your reckoning—or could you? So you’re in the fog—literally and figuratively.

In the first example, where you laid a deliberate offset, the intended track was about ⅜ mile to the north of the objective. How much deliberate offset should be made is a matter of judgment. On a long run in toward a long beach that runs for miles in either direction with few identifying marks, even if visibility is good, you may prefer to make allowances of a mile or more. But don’t use this technique blindly. Study the chart carefully for possible dangers that may lie along the beach.

The same procedure may be used in other uncertain situations, such as crossing the Gulf Stream. Rather than attempting to make an exact allowance for the distance that the stream will set northward, make a somewhat overgenerous allowance. If you don’t pick up your target landfall after the allotted passage time, you can turn northward with confidence rather than facing a 50-50 chance of being wrong.

### Using a Predicted Timetable

If you are anticipating fog, you can take most of the worry out of the process by planning and plotting your run in advance. This same “timetable” technique can make a night run a pleasure instead of a trial.

Don’t wait until you are underway to lay out your course, distances, running times, etc. Go over the entire trip in advance and acquaint yourself with each leg of the cruise, the aids to navigation that you will pass, the characteristics of lights, etc.

If you are piloting a powerboat and you can predict your speed with precision, set up a timetable. Set your time of departure as 0000 and note, in orderly fashion, the predicted time of arrival abeam of every light and buoy on both sides of your intended track. Alongside each entry, show the characteristics of the navigational aid and the compass course at the time. You can also enter into your timetable the approximate times that major lights can be expected to become visible.

Use a watch or luminous clock with a luminous dial; set it at 0000 (12 o’clock) and start it when you leave your point of departure. The elapsed time of each event along the track will provide a quick aid to identification for each light or sound signal along the way.

By using elapsed time rather than actual time, you build some flexibility into your plan. A late or early departure will not upset your entire timetable. Any discrepancies that creep in can be compensated for by a reset of the clock.

### Coastwise Piloting at Night

The lights of towns along shore can be used to estimate distance offshore. An experienced boater may be able to judge his distance by whether or not he can see the glow from the street and sign lights, or whether he sees the lighting directly. This might be a useful technique on a long, straight shoreline of consistent elevation. Of course, the height at which the lights might be seen directly will vary with the observer’s height of eye and should be tested by observing the shoreline at known distances.

You may also be able to follow a shoreline (without the help of a depth sounder) by noting the point at which the beach or shoreline disappears from view. This requires a straight shoreline of consistent elevation, as well as some experience, but it can be quite a useful check; see Figure 18-50.

Figure 18-50 Many coastal areas with regular slopes toward deeper water offer depth information that can determine distance off. A rough but useful estimation of distance can also be made by using your height of eye at the helm and observing the buildings ashore.

Let’s say you wish to parallel the New Jersey or Long Island beaches. From the deck of a typical small boat, at about 4.5 miles offshore, the beach will be under your horizon. If you can just see the beach, you are about 4 miles off. Fog and haze will make this observation unreliable, and the height of your eye on your particular boat will also vary this distance.

You can also use your view of buildings on shore to estimate distance. For example, if you can make out individual windows on houses, you are probably about 2 miles offshore. With this rule of thumb, you could confidently stay from 2 to 4 miles off a long beach with no other reference.

### Echo Piloting

An interesting variation on the technique for estimating distance off a beach is one used in Alaska and British Columbia, where the problem is often to maintain a distance off a rocky cliff face. It consists of sounding a short blast on the whistle or horn and timing the return of the echo.

The interval in seconds (preferably measured on a stopwatch) is divided by two because the sound wave goes to the cliff face and back. Multiply that figure by 1,100, which is a rough value for the speed of sound in air in feet per second. (Multiply by 340 for the distance in meters.)

For example, you sound a blast and the interval is 5 seconds. Multiply 2.5 seconds (the one-way trip) by 1,100 and you have 2,650 feet, or a distance off of slightly less than 0.5 nautical mile.

In some cases, a pilot might use an echo from both shores to stay in the middle of a passage simply by determining which one returns first, then altering course away from it.

### The Rule-of-Sixty

This is another instance in which a convenient mental calculation can be made to reach a safe approximation. While it should never act as a substitute for position determination, this kind of calculation can be useful in making a decision while cruising shorthanded.

The rule-of-sixty provides a simple way of determining a new course to clear an off-lying danger area by the desired amount. You need to know your present course, your present distance off, and the distance by which you would like to clear the danger area.

Let’s assume that you are in the position shown on the chart. You have come out of Portsmouth Harbor and are running a southerly course down the coast to Cape Ann. Somewhere off Newburyport you pick up the light on Straitsmouth Island, dead ahead; see Figure 18-51, at the bottom center, marked C. Your course made good along the line A-C has been 164° true. A bell buoy has been placed 1.5 miles eastward of the light, marking a number of rock ledges. You want to make a course change to clear the shoals. By how many degrees should you change course?

Figure 18-51 The “rule-of-sixty” can provide a shortcut for calculating the change in course required to clear an obstacle. It can be applied without making a chart plot.

You could get out the chart and plot your position—which, if you are able to do so, is what you should do. However, you can also apply the rule-of-sixty and determine your new course in your head.

You know that the light you are seeing on the horizon is visible for 6 miles. (We’ll assume that it is a clear night; if it isn’t, you will have to establish distance by some other means.) The procedure is to divide 60 (the rule) by 6 (the distance) to get 10. Since you want to clear the light by 1.5 miles, multiply 10 by 1.5 and get 15—this will be the number of degrees by which you will have to change course. Thus your new course is 164° − 15° = 149° true. Long before you need to be concerned about the rock ledges, you will pick up the bell buoy north of Flat Ground.

The rule-of-sixty is never a substitute for proper plotting, but in rough weather or other difficult circumstances, it can be a reassuring guide.

### Distance Along an Irregular Course

A pilot is often required to measure a total distance along a course that consists of several short, irregular legs. Of course, each leg can be measured and added, but there’s a much easier graphic method.

In Figure 18-52, the boat is at A. You need to know the total run to F along the track B, C, D, E, F. The figure shows guidelines, which extend each leg outward, but after you become familiar with the procedure you can use your eye to make the same extensions.

Figure 18-52 A pair of dividers can make quick work of adding the lengths of several straight segments of a curved course. Span the first leg, A to B, then swing the point of the dividers from A to A1 in line with B and C and plant it. Next, move the point of the dividers that was at B to C; this adds the lengths A-B and B-C. Continue this procedure until you reach the final point, F in this example. Use the total span of the dividers on the chart’s graphic scale to get the total distance.

Place your divider points on A and B. Swing the A point to A1 (which lies along an extension of the next leg). Plant the divider point at A1 and stretch the other leg to C. Again, swing the A1 point to A2 (the extension of the next leg.) Plant the point at A2 and stretch the dividers to D. Repeat in this way until the dividers are planted at A4 and stretched to F.

Now you can lay that divider span along the graphic scale or the latitude scale at either side of the chart. You can make the measurement quickly and more accurately this way than by measuring and adding each leg.

### Piloting Under Sail

The principles of piloting a small sailboat are no different from piloting a powerboat. However, much of successful piloting is not principle but practice, and the practice aboard a sailboat may differ in several respects.

Most important is the fact that sailboat speeds are much more difficult to predict. While a powerboat pilot might establish a timetable for a particular set of legs of his trip (refer to “Using a Predicted Timetable,” this page), a sailboat skipper would be much less likely to be able to predict the boat’s speed several hours in advance along a particular leg of the trip.

In addition to dealing with the built-in complexity of a particular track, a sailboat navigator also makes extra calculations and plots to account for the fact that his boat will tack upwind and downwind too.

For the skipper of a powerboat, this leg may be a simple straight line with an easy-to-predict speed and direction. But for a sailor it becomes a series of doglegs, each with its own requirements (or estimates) and other variables to do with steering the fastest possible course following a shifting wind, rather than a straight line; see Figure 18-53.

Figure 18-53 The direct course (the one that a powerboat would take) is known as the rhumb line. The actual course that a sailboat might follow, both upwind and down, is considerably longer and more difficult to reckon. The values shown above are typical of a well-trimmed, deep-keel craft.

This makes it far more important for a sailboat navigator to keep track of his DR track at every tack and jibe, and to make an estimate of position just before the course is changed. It may be possible to sail equal times of each tack to simplify the calculation, but this is useful only when the destination is directly upwind, or down.

Since sailboats generally travel upwind with a “leeway angle” (refer to Chapter 8), allowances must be made for the difference between the compass orientation to the centerline of the hull and the hull’s actual direction of travel through the water. It might vary by 2 or 3 degrees—much smaller than a typical steering error, but of potential significance as an additional factor over a long leg.

A rule of thumb for sailing a tacking leg when the wind is not directly from or to your destination is to sail the longest leg first, except when the shorter leg may provide an opportunity for a fix that would be missing on the longer leg.

Finally, the actual chartwork aboard a sailboat can be more difficult due to a number of factors. The navigator may be working at an extreme angle of heel, for example, and is much more likely to be soaking wet.

### Practice—and More Practice

Position determination cannot be learned totally “from the book.” Study is essential, but you must put into practice the various procedures and techniques learned. It’s a good practice and good entertainment to “overnavigate” during daylight and in good weather so that you will be experienced, capable, and confident when the sun sets or the weather closes in.

GPS and other electronic navigation systems have made unnecessary the routine use of many of the procedures described above, but remember, equipment can fail and power can be lost; you had better be prepared to navigate the “old-fashioned” way!

# CHAPTER19

Figure 19-01 The importance of electrical power on board boats has increased enormously in recent years. Every boater should understand the fundamentals of electricity, and a skipper who cruises away from his home waters should be capable of diagnosing common problems and making at least temporary repairs.

ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS

Fundamentals of Electricity & Electrical Circuits • Storage Batteries • Shorepower Alternative Energy Sources • Electrical Equipment on Board

Electricity has become an essential ingredient in boating. Originally used for engine starting and lighting only, electrical power is now used for many tasks—for running communications and navigation equipment, for cooking, for air conditioning and heating, and for such labor-intensive chores as raising the anchor and lifting the tender aboard.

Nowadays we take for granted the use of many electrical appliances that formerly would never have been afloat. More importantly, we place a greater reliance on electronic navigation and communication devices that must be reliably and constantly supplied with electrical power as a matter of safety rather than convenience.

Acquiring, storing, and delivering this power has become a complex matter, necessitating a knowledge of basic fundamentals, applicable standards, and an awareness that the boat’s batteries are under constant demand.

Electrical and electronic are terms often used in an overlapping manner. In this book, “electrical equipment” includes such devices as motors, alternators, and lights. “Electronic equipment” refers to devices using transistors and integrated circuits—for example, radios, depth sounders, radar, and radionavigation systems. This chapter focuses on electrical systems, whereas Chapter 20 concentrates on radio, emergency, and satellite communications and Chapter 16 introduces the use of electronics in navigation.

## GENERATING & STORING ELECTRICAL POWER

There is little need for a boater to delve deeply into the physics of electrical power—after all, most of us deal with electricity perfectly well at home without first undertaking a course in electromotive forces. Nevertheless, some fundamental background is helpful; with the convenience of electrical power aboard boats come certain potential hazards and maintenance problems.

##### CAUTION FOR BOATERS

Just as on shore, 120V or 240V AC electrical circuits on boats can produce a harmful, even deadly, electrical shock if improperly installed. This hazard exists not only to persons on board the craft, but also to people swimming in the water in proximity to an improperly wired or inadequately maintained vessel. If you do not possess a good degree of technical competence in this area, it is suggested that you always employ a fully qualified marine electrician to accomplish major installations and repairs to your boat’s electrical system, especially the 120V or 240V AC circuits.

### Basic Electrical Terminology

Electrical systems can be described in terms of the type of electricity used and the voltage level used.

#### Direct & Alternating Current

The terms “DC” and “AC” are used by just about everyone, but usually with little recognition of the differences between them. Direct current flows in one direction only and is substantially constant in value; DC is used on boats at a relatively low voltage similar to how it is used on automobiles and trucks, typically described as “12 volts,” although actually between 12 and 14; see Figure 19-02. Larger craft may use 24- or even 32-volt DC systems. DC can be applied to a reversible electrochemical cell, storing or accumulating chemical energy until the reaction is reversed, delivering electrical energy. Each cell in a boat’s lead-acid storage battery delivers 2.1 volts when fully charged. Six cells connected in series and housed in a common container create a “12”-volt battery. The amount of energy stored depends on the physical size of the cells. A Group 27 battery is shown in Figure 19-03.

Figure 19-02 The basic source of electric power on boats is an alternator, belt-driven from the propulsion engine. The alternator produces AC current, which is rectified by internal diodes to provide 12- or 24-volt DC current for the boat’s electrical system.

Figure 19-03 For times when the engine is not running, and the alternator is not producing electricity for the boat’s needs, electrical power is stored in batteries. Groups of 2-volt cells are connected in series to form a battery providing the desired voltage. Shown here is a 12-volt battery consisting of six cells. In higher-voltage systems, batteries themselves may be connected in series, such as four 6-volt batteries in a 24-volt system.

While each wire in a DC circuit is always either positive or negative (+ or −), the polarity of the wires in an AC current system alternate between plus and minus at a regular interval called the AC frequency. The standard AC frequency in North America and most of South America is 60 hertz (often called 60 cycles), with 50 hertz used elsewhere. The advantage of AC power is the ability to use a transformer to change its voltage upward or downward as needed for each application. AC power systems on boats typically operate at either 120 or 240 volts, with the higher voltage able to deliver four times as much energy using the same size wires as a 120-volt system. Electric motors and some other devices are frequency sensitive. Operating 60-Hz devices from 50-Hz power may cause improper operation, overheating, and irreversible damage.

Shorepower (electrical power brought on board a boat from any source on land) is always alternating current, which can also be produced by an engine-driven high-voltage alternator (genset) or a DC to AC inverter. Power supplied by storage batteries is always direct current. However, it should not be assumed that, although a vessel’s AC and DC systems are isolated from one another, there is never an interchange of power between them. Quite to the contrary, the AC power brought on board from a shorepower connection, and that produced by an onboard genset, can be changed by a battery charger into DC and used to recharge a vessel’s storage batteries. Conversely, DC drawn from the ship’s storage batteries can be changed into AC by an inverter and used to power the vessel’s AC distribution system, within the power limit of the inverter; see Figure 19-04.

Figure 19-04 Electrical power for 120-volt AC devices can be obtained from the boat’s low-voltage DC system with the use of a DC/AC inverter. The maximum power is determined by the rating of the inverter and ability of the batteries to supply the current, and is usually limited to about 2,800 watts on a 12-volt system. Some inverters can function in reverse as battery chargers, operating from AC power.

#### Electrical Units & Calculations

Conceptually, the behavior of electricity flowing in wires can be likened to that of water flowing in pipes. The units of electrical measure are likewise analogous: Voltage is analogous to pressure in a water pipe. An ampere (commonly called an amp) measures the amount of current that is flowing, which is comparable to the rate of flow of water moving through a pipe. And ohms measure resistance, which can be visualized as corresponding to the friction that is generated when water flows through pipes.

There is a simple equation—Ohm’s Law—that explains the relationship between current (I), voltage (E), and resistance (R),

Current flow is directly proportional to voltage and inversely proportional to the resistance in the circuit. In other words, the voltage drop in a circuit (E, in volts) equals the current flow in the circuit (I, in amperes, abbreviated “A”) times the resistance of that circuit (R, in ohms).

E = I x R

Watts and kilowatts (1,000 watts = 1kW) are measures of power—the rate at which energy is consumed or generated. Using the water analogy, power compares to the volume of water moving through a pipe, and energy to the total volume of water that flows in a stated period of time.

Another simple equation expresses the relationship between watts, volts, and amps:

Watts = Volts x Amps

This will be useful when we need to determine the electrical needs of a system we might want for a particular vessel; see this page.

In DC systems, power requirements are commonly stated in amperes, and energy consumption in ampere-hours (Ah).

### Onboard Electrical Systems

The onboard source of electrical power can be divided into three broad categories:

• Power stored in batteries.

• Power brought aboard a vessel from landlines via a shorepower connection.

• Power generated as needed and used.

Associated with each of these categories are one or more distinct, identifiable supply subsystems. For instance, electrical power that is created on board a boat as needed may be produced by alternators that are belt-driven by the vessel’s main propulsion engine or engines. Often it may also be produced by a 60-Hz alternator driven by a separate gasoline or diesel engine (a genset).

Supply subsystems feed power to the vessel’s electrical delivery systems, which consist of a network of distribution panels, bus bars, circuit breakers (or fuses), switches, wiring, outlets, and the like.

#### AC System Voltages

Not only does electrical current differ in terms of being direct or alternating; it differs in terms of voltage. Appliances designed for a specified voltage or voltage range must not be used on systems having other voltages. Most modern electrical equipment is designed to cope with a modest range of voltage, but it is always important to check and comply with the manufacturer’s specifications for that range. Otherwise, irreversible damage to the equipment involved may occur, and personnel may be put at risk.

A system using a higher voltage has the advantage that, for a given wattage demand, it does not require as heavy wiring as at a lower voltage. Moreover, higher voltages are better at overcoming localized resistances, for example, minor buildups of corrosion at connecting terminals.

When high wattages are involved, the smaller wires that are practical with higher voltages are advantageous in terms of cost, weight, and the physical difficulties of installation. (Smaller-diameter wires are lighter and more flexible, making them easier to snake through the constricted passages available on boats.) This is why high-demand electric cooking ranges and clothes dryers are most often designed to operate on 240-volt AC, rather than the 120-volt electricity used for light bulbs, stereos, TVs, and the like.

At dockside in North America, you’ll find 120-volt AC power and often also 240-volt AC power. Actually, these voltage designations are nominal—the designed voltages of shorepower will vary from 110 to 120 AC, and 220 to 240 AC, respectively. Moreover, in practice, shorepower voltage may drop well below these lower range limits. In Europe and many other parts of the world, nominal shorepower is 220- to 240-volt AC.

##### ELECTRICAL STANDARDS FOR BOATS

When it comes to understanding and following various standards of construction and recommended practices, there is no more important area for standards than that of the vessel’s electrical systems. If improperly installed or poorly maintained, these systems can pose not only fire and explosion as well as corrosion hazards, but also the potential for electrocution.

The United States Coast Guard (USCG) has certain basic electrical standards that are applicable to gasoline-powered vessels and that speak primarily of ignition protection (reduction of explosion hazard) and overcurrent protection (to avoid overheating and fires). A review of these standards will show that they are very basic and provide little “practical” information on vessel wiring other than for these two purposes.

The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) publishes Standard No. 302 for Pleasure and Commercial Motor Craft. This covers a wide range of various topics with respect to fire protection, especially in the areas of electrical circuits and lightning protection.

However, by far the most comprehensive standards available today are those published by the American Boat and Yacht Council (ABYC—refer to Appendix B). In covering almost every major system on a vessel, the ABYC Standards go into great detail on the subjects of DC and AC electrical systems, battery chargers and inverters, lightning protection, cathodic protection, and others. The ABYC Standards also have been used for the development of various international standards being adopted in Europe.

#### AC System Frequencies

Many items of equipment used on boats, such as battery chargers, microwaves, televisions, stereos, and fluorescent lights, contain transformers for the purpose of changing the voltage within the equipment. When operating on “foreign” power (such as 50 Hz), it is imperative that this equipment be “compatible” with the 50-Hz shore-power source. This may be ascertained by looking at the nameplate on the equipment and verifying that it says “50/60 Hz.” If this type of equipment is not installed on your boat, you have two choices: Either outfit with special equipment to be compatible or, when in foreign ports, operate this equipment only from the vessel’s genset in order to obtain the requisite 60-Hz power.

There are transformers that can step shore-power AC voltage up or down to match the voltage requirements of a vessel’s AC equipment (see this page). However, none of these change the frequency of the shorepower alternating current, so care must be taken when hooking up to foreign shorepower sources, even when you have managed to adapt to noncompatible outlet configurations. If a shoreline isolation transformer is installed on board the boat, it must be compatible with 50-Hz AC power if operation in foreign ports is anticipated where this frequency is likely to be encountered.

#### DC System Voltages

Direct current for shipboard use is generally 12 or 24 volts, with 12 volts most common (32-volt systems may be encountered on older boats). The 12- or 24-volt potential is obtained by connecting individual 2-volt cells together to form a battery (3 cells = 6 volts, 6 cells = 12 volts). A fully charged “2-volt” lead-acid cell produces a potential of between 2.10 and 2.13 volts. A fully charged 6-cell, “12-volt” battery will deliver between 12.6 and 12.8 volts. Although the main DC electrical system in a boat may operate at a nominal 12 volts, the starting motors on large diesel engines and those that power anchor windlasses and bow thrusters may operate from 24 VDC to reduce the amount of current they draw through the connecting wiring. Doubling the voltage cuts the current in half and reduces the voltage drop in the wiring.

Modest size 12-volt systems are most often powered from a 12-volt battery of a size that will provide the required amount of stored energy. The five most common sizes are Groups 25, 27, 31, 4D, and 8D and range in weight from 45 to 160 pounds. Systems that require a large amount of stored energy often use two large 6-volt batteries, each weighing about 120 pounds, connected in series to yield 12 volts.

### Determining Electrical Needs

Electrical power is the lifeblood of all electronic equipment. Although a few devices may operate from self-contained batteries, most electronic equipment is powered from the boat’s electrical system. With outboards as small as 4 hp available with alternators, virtually any powered boat can be equipped with navigation lights and electronics, provided the total load does not exceed the charging capacity of the alternator.

The electrical power demand in a 12-volt system is usually stated in amperes. Long- and short-duration loads are considered separately when determining the required energy-storage capacity of the battery and the charging capability of the alternator. The total of the short- and long-term load currents is used to determine the required wire size and protective device ratings for the electrical power system. Required battery capacity is determined by adding the ampere-hours of energy required by each consumer (amps x minutes of operation/60) during the period when no charging system is operating; for example, when at anchor. (Daily or 24-hour demand is often chosen as the default for required-capacity calculations.) A typical small cruiser or sailboat anchored out overnight might require 64 amp-hours. Two Group 27 deep-cycle batteries would be sufficient for this electrical load.

For 120-volt AC systems, the load is normally computed in watts. The wattage rating on an onboard item of equipment serves as an approximate measure of the maximum amount of power that the electrical item will require when operated. By adding together the maximum wattage requirements of all equipment that will be operated simultaneously, a vessel’s maximum requirements for AC electrical power can be determined. Wattage ratings also provide important information about the required sizes for wiring and the required ratings for protective circuit breakers and/or fuses. Gensets are normally rated in terms of kilowatts; shorepower cords are rated in terms of ampere capacity.

The amount of power required to operate all of the AC consumers can be expressed in watts (volts x amps = watts). This simple relationship works well for cook stoves, hair dryers, water heaters, and other resistive loads. For example: cook stove, 2,500 watts; + hair dryer, 1,500 watts; + water heater, 1,250 watts; total load = 5,250 watts (5.25 kW). However, motor driven-devices—including refrigeration and air-conditioning equipment and some battery chargers—demand more from their electrical supply than simply the watt rating on the nameplate. Motors are inductive loads and can demand 3 percent to as much as 30 percent more current from the supply than the wattage rating indicates and up to 3 times the current when starting. This extra drain is called reactive power and can significantly limit a genset’s ability to cope with the boat’s total electrical load.

#### Typical Boat Systems

Most small craft have a basic 12-volt DC system consisting of storage batteries, an alternator on each propulsion engine, and perhaps a battery charger for use with shorepower. Typically, the boat will have both a starting battery for each engine plus one or more house batteries that provide power for lights, pumps, radios, and other accessory equipment. The readily apparent advantage of such a system is that you can be assured of having adequate engine starting power no matter how much you use lights, fans, etc. These batteries have design differences. The primary characteristic of a starting battery is the ability to deliver large amounts of current for a limited time; a house battery should have the ability to deliver energy at a moderate rate over many discharge/recharge cycles. A battery undergoes a “deep cycle” when 20 percent or more of its stored energy is consumed before it is recharged; for maximum battery life, discharge should be limited to no more than 50 percent (voltage dropping to about 12.2 volts). Deep-cycle batteries can provide 200 to more than 3,000 use-cycles. Those that provide the longest cycle life are more expensive to buy but cost less per cycle. A starting battery used in cycling service will be worn out after about 50 cycles. Deep-cycle batteries can be used for starting gasoline engines and diesel engines up to about 400 hp.

A separate AC system connected to shore power or to an engine-driven AC alternator—i.e., a genset like the one in Figure 19-05—will be required to power equipment such as air conditioners and home-style appliances. Modest amounts of AC power, up to about 2 to 3 kW, can be obtained from a 12-VDC to 120-VAC inverter; refer to Figure 19-04 and this page. However, an inverter powering an electric toaster (1,000 watts) will demand a current of 90+ amperes from the batteries. The battery’s limited ability to efficiently deliver high currents makes it necessary to limit the length of time inverters are used to power even relatively modest AC loads.

Figure 19-05 When the demands for 120-volt AC electrical power exceed what can be reasonably drawn from the boat’s batteries using an inverter, such as for electric stoves and air conditioners, an auxiliary generating plant (genset) must be installed. It should use the same fuel as the craft’s main engines.

### Storage Batteries

Lead-acid batteries store chemical energy. They release it when needed by converting the energy into electrical form. This is accomplished with use of an electrochemical reaction between two molecularly dissimilar metals, lead peroxide (at the positive plate) and spongy lead (at the negative plate), that are immersed in an electrolyte (a weak sulfuric-acid solution).

Connecting an electrical load to the battery enables a flow of electrons from a chemical reaction in which the lead peroxide and the spongy lead are converted into lead sulfate. The process will continue, with constantly decreasing voltage and, therefore, current, until the battery is considered to be exhausted (although a voltmeter connected to an exhausted 12-volt battery will still indicate about 10.5 volts).

A discharged battery is recharged by supplying DC voltage to its terminals at a strength sufficient to reverse the internal chemical reaction that delivered the energy consumed during the discharge process. Lead sulfate at the positive plate reverts to lead peroxide, while at the negative plate it converts back to spongy lead; the sulfur that was removed from the electrolyte to form the lead sulfate is restored to the electrolyte. While the creation of lead sulfate is a normal and necessary part of the operation of the battery, its presence will shorten and eventually end the life of the battery if it is not converted back into lead peroxide and spongy lead.

##### CARING FOR FLOODED WET-CELL BATTERIES

There are five essential actions in the proper maintenance of wet-cell lead-acid batteries:

* MINIMIZE OR ELIMINATE DEEP-DISCHARGE CYCLES.

Each time a storage battery is cycled (discharged/recharged), some of its useful life is lost. The electrochemical
reaction that produces the electrical current causes the plates to gradually deteriorate because of active material lost due to mechanical stress and the inevitable accumulation of lead sulfate that has not been completely reconverted into lead peroxide and spongy lead. Eventually the loss of active material reaches a point where the battery’s energy storage capacity decreases to 50% of what it was when new. The battery is considered dead at this point.

* UTILIZE PROPERLY CONTROLLED CHARGING PROCEDURES.

Battery charging must be precisely managed. Most battery chargers and some engine-driven alternators use a 3-step charging process: a moderately high-current bulk charge; a lower-current absorption cycle; and, finally, a float charge at very low current. Some shore-powered chargers can apply an “equalizing” charge, a higher than usual charging voltage, regulated at a low current, that restores all of the battery’s cells to an equal and maximum state of charge. Delayed or improper charging is the most common cause of premature battery failure.

* MAINTAIN THE CORRECT ELECTROLYTE LEVEL.

You must check electrolyte levels regularly and replace any lost electrolyte by refilling with distilled water according to the manufacturer’s specifications. (By using distilled water you will avoid the introduction of foreign chemicals and materials into the electrolyte.)

* KEEP THE BATTERY CLEAN AND ITS TERMINAL CONNECTIONS CORROSION-FREE AND TIGHT.

Regularly clean the tops of your batteries with a cloth dampened in a baking soda solution (the baking soda neutralizes any acid that has escaped via the cell vent caps). Be very careful not to let any baking soda solution get into the battery’s interior, as the solution will degrade the electrolyte.

Using a wire brush, keep the terminals and cable connectors clean and shiny; make certain the connections are tight. After cleaning and reinstalling the cable connections, coat the terminals with an appropriate battery terminal compound to retard corrosion. Do not use petroleum jelly, which tends to liquefy and seep into the connection, causing more harm than good.

* PROVIDE GOOD VENTILATION.

The wet-cell type of lead-acid batteries produces flammable hydrogen gas during recharging. And although hydrogen gas is lighter than air and quickly dissipates, it does represent a danger that should not be ignored. Batteries can explode, so the prudent skipper is especially careful when working around them. When dealing with terminal connections, take care to vent the battery space well, make certain that the batteries are not being charged at the time, and take care not to create sparks. Moreover, it is always a good idea to wear splash-proof safety goggles when you are dealing with batteries. For further safety, remove all jewelry.

Caution: If you accidentally come in contact with battery acid, wash it off immediately to avoid severe burns to your skin. If battery acid contacts your eyes, flush them immediately with cool water, and seek medical attention. Also remember that battery acid will eat holes in most fabrics.

To obtain maximum energy storage performance and longest possible life from a lead-acid battery, the average level of discharge should be limited to 50 percent of its capacity (12.2 volts with no load connected), and the battery should be promptly recharged after each use cycle.

#### Replacing the Energy

Energy that has been removed from a battery must be restored with the least possible delay to assure maximum reconversion of the lead sulfate formed during discharge into active energy-producing materials. Energy for recharging is supplied from a shorepowered battery charger or from an engine-driven alternator similar to the type used in vehicles; refer to Figure 19-02. Although alternators can deliver a modest amount of energy when the engine is idling, significant amounts of power usually require an engine speed of at least 1500 to 1800 rpm. The voltage supplied to the battery as it is recharged will eventually reach approximately 13.6 volts for a 12-volt battery.

A voltage regulator manages the alternator’s output voltage to assure safe and efficient recharging of the battery by automatically adjusting the current flowing through the alternator’s field windings in response to measurements of battery voltage and temperature. Most stock alternators use internal regulators that are better suited for vehicles than for boats. Substituting an external, marine-grade voltage regulator can significantly improve battery system performance. When shorepower is available, a marine-grade battery charger can automatically maintain the battery at a full state of charge while supplying power to the boat’s DC power system; see Figure 19-06, for example. Battery charger installation should be in accordance with ABYC Safety Standard A-31.

Figure 19-06 This advanced-design battery charger, or power converter, will charge batteries fast and fully, but most importantly, it will protect the batteries from being overcharged by continuously sensing their state of charge.

Supplying electrical energy to a discharged lead-acid battery reverses the electrochemical reaction that produced the lead sulfate, changing most of it to lead peroxide and spongy lead, thereby restoring the amount of chemical energy stored in the battery to a level close to its initial state.

##### MAINTAINING GEL-CELL & AGM BATTERIES

Gel-cell and AGM (absorbed glass mat) lead-acid batteries do not lose water from their electrolyte. A pressure-relief valve in each cell retains the oxygen and hydrogen gases emitted during the charging process; the increased pressure forces the gases to recombine into water. The valve opens, venting gas and electrolyte, only if the battery is charged improperly or suffers an internal failure. Any gel-cell or AGM battery that shows evidence of leakage must be disconnected and replaced.

The charging voltages applied to both gel-cell and AGM batteries must be carefully limited to the maximum specified by the manufacturer of the battery. Different types of batteries—flooded-cell, gel-cell, and AGM—must not be charged in parallel. If either gel-cell or AGM batteries are substituted for previously installed flooded-cell batteries, it will be necessary to adjust the alternator voltage regulator and shorepower-operated battery charger to match the charging voltage requirements of the new battery. Most battery chargers provide charge settings for each type of battery. The internal voltage regulators in most alternators do not permit adjustment of the charging voltage, making it necessary to fit the alternator with an external voltage regulator.

Gel-cell and AGM batteries lose less stored energy due to internal chemical reactions (self-discharge) than flooded-cell batteries and can be somewhat more tolerant of being left in a partially discharged state. However, like all lead-acid batteries, they perform best when kept fully charged, with per-cycle discharge limited to 50% of capacity.

Gel-cell batteries offer the advantage that they can be tilted or even turned upside down without the risk of spilling electrolyte. This is an advantage for any boat, but particularly for sailboats.

#### Gel-cell & AGM Batteries

The maintenance-free aspect and low self-discharge characteristics of gel-cell and AGM batteries make them particularly attractive for use on boats. Both types rely on the same electrochemical process as the flooded-cell variety; however, they use a somewhat altered electrolyte and different alloys in the plates. Cells are sealed; the pressure of hydrogen and oxygen gas emitted during charging increases to the level needed to force them to recombine into water, eliminating the loss of water from the electrolyte. The gelled electrolyte is immobilized, permitting the battery to be operated in positions other than upright (but not permanently inverted). Highest quality gel-cell batteries can sustain up to a thousand 50-percent-discharge/recharge cycles.

Absorbed glass mat lead-acid batteries share many characteristics with the gel-cell, including sealed cells, similar choice of alloys in the plate structures, and electrolyte chemistry. Unlike the gel-cell, the electrolyte is a fluid; however, it is entirely absorbed within microfine layers of fiber tightly packed between the plates in each cell. The tight packing of large numbers of thin plates increases the area of active material exposed to the electrolyte, allowing the battery to deliver high discharge and accept high charging currents. Charging temperature limits for AGM and voltage limits for gel-cell and AGM batteries must be strictly observed to prevent cell overpressure and venting of gas and electrolyte, which, if they occur, will require replacement of the battery.

Gel-cell or AGM batteries are about twice the price of an equal size standard quality flooded-cell battery and about equal in price to a premium flooded-cell battery whose useful life can extend to thousands of cycles.

#### Choosing Battery Size & Type

It’s extremely important to have the appropriate type and size of battery or batteries for the job at hand. Each discharge-charge cycle in a storage battery results in a degree of irreversible chemical degradation of its plates. The “deeper” the cycle—that is, the more the battery is discharged before being recharged—the greater the resultant chemical degradation. For that reason, deep-cycling is one of the major factors in—if not the primary cause of—premature battery failure. It’s necessary to provide a total battery capacity of at least twice the anticipated total amp-hour consumption per cycle to assure acceptable battery life.

However, capacity alone is not the sole consideration in determining what is the right size and type of battery. There are two basic types of lead-acid batteries: SLI (starting, lighting, and ignition) and deep-cycle. SLI batteries are designed to supply the short-duration, high-current draw of the engine-starting motor, after which the alternator recharges the battery. Deep-cycle batteries are designed to deliver moderate amounts of power for many hours, powering the boat’s lights, fans, electronics, and entertainment systems, often depleting half of the energy stored in the batteries before they are recharged.

SLI batteries (and many AGM batteries) are built using large numbers of thin plates to increase the total surface area of the active material in contact with the electrolyte, maximizing the available current flow. Although ideal for SLI service, the thin plate structure does not provide the depth of active material and mechanical strength needed to withstand the stress of repeated deep cycling. The AGM battery’s thin plates are tightly constrained between the electrolyte-absorption material layers and are therefore better able to withstand the stress of cycling service, typically providing a 300-cycle life.

Some so-called deep-cycle batteries are little more than relabeled starting batteries. So when buying batteries, check the specifications of similarly sized starting and deep-cycle batteries. For a given overall external size and weight, the deep-cycle battery will have fewer but thicker plates.

ABYC Standard E–11, AC and DC Electrical Systems on Boats provides general design and installation guidance for both low-voltage DC (12- and 24-volt) and 120/240-VAC electrical systems. ABYC Standard E–10, Storage Batteries contains information about battery capacity, location, installation, and ventilation practices necessary to comply with both USCG and voluntary industry standards; see Figure 19-07.

Figure 19-07 Batteries must be installed so that they are firmly held in place. For all batteries, ventilation must be provided to prevent the build-up of flammable hydrogen gas, which tends to rise (even “sealed” batteries may vent if abused). Covers are essential to protect the terminals from being short-circuited should a conductive object, such as a wrench, fall on them.

#### Battery Testing & Charging

After initial selection, the second most important factor in battery performance and longevity is proper control of discharge/recharge cycles. Draining a battery below about half its full charge before recharging greatly accelerates the deterioration of its plates. So does leaving a battery in a partial or fully discharged state for long periods of time.

It is important to monitor the status of a boat’s DC electrical system and the voltage of each battery. Engines equipped with alternators supply at least a modest amount of electrical power even at idle speed and are monitored by voltmeters. The voltage indication may be close to 12 volts when the engine is idling, rising above 13 volts when underway.

Although the typical instrument panel voltmeter provides some useful information, it is not accurate enough to indicate the state of charge of the battery. The special analog battery-condition voltmeters installed on many boats are designed to more precisely measure voltage over a limited range (often 8–16 volts), making it possible to determine the voltage of each battery within about ±0.2 volts; refer to Figure 19-08. More precise and complete information can be obtained from a digital voltmeter or a battery-condition monitor such as that shown in Figure 19-09.

Figure 19-08 The state of charge of a storage battery can be determined from its voltage. Specially designed voltmeters are used for this purpose; the lower part of the voltage range is collapsed so that readings can be taken more precisely around the normal voltage range. The switch selects the battery to be checked.

Figure 19-09 A more precise and useful watch on battery condition can be accomplished with an electronic device designed for this purpose. It will show voltage, current presently being drawn from or charged into the battery, accumulated ampere-hours of discharge, and other data.

A 12-volt, deep-cycle battery is considered fully charged when its no-load voltage is 12.6 volts or higher and fully discharged at 11.8 volts; 12.4 = 75%, 12.2 = 50% (the voltage at which it is desirable to switch to another battery or begin recharging), 12.0 = 25%, and 11.8 = 0%. The voltage should be checked when there is no load connected to the battery. The battery’s voltage indicates only its state of charge, not its energy storage capacity. The voltage of a fully charged battery nearing the end of its useful life will still be 12.6 volts or higher. While the only precise way to measure a battery’s remaining energy-storage capacity is with a special test meter, the way a battery cranks an engine or powers some other large load can be a useful indication of its condition.

The specific gravity of the electrolyte in a lead-acid battery varies with the battery’s state of charge. For wet-cell batteries, it is possible to measure state of charge with a hydrometer—in fact, for many years, this was the standard practice. (Using a hydrometer is still an easy way to identify a failing cell within a battery that is in otherwise good condition.) However, it is far more practical to use a voltmeter.

Your battery-condition meters may reveal that your batteries are not being fully charged when you run your engine. Or they may indicate that, while your starting battery comes to full charge, your ship’s service battery, which has been drained overnight by your lights, refrigerator, radio, etc., does not. Such a situation is common and is one of the leading causes of accelerated battery deterioration.

The voltage needed to completely recharge a battery depends on its temperature. The voltage regulator built into the alternator senses the temperature of the alternator and, in addition, senses the voltage at its output terminal, ignoring the voltage drop in the wires to the battery. The internal regulator is satisfactory in a vehicle where the battery temperature is closely related to the temperature of the alternator and the connecting wires to the battery are short. On boats, the typical problem of chronic undercharging of the batteries can be corrected by installing an external marine-service voltage regulator that senses voltage and temperature at the battery.

The energy-storage capacity and service life of a battery depends on how deeply it is discharged before being promptly and properly recharged from an external-regulator-equipped alternator or an AC-powered marine battery charger. The preferred recharge process will proceed in three steps: a “bulk” charge that restores about 75 to 80% of the energy removed; a lower-current, longer-duration “absorption” charge that completes the charge; and, finally, a low-current “float” charge that offsets self-discharge, keeping the battery fully charged. The voltage applied to, and the current flowing into, the battery at each step must match the battery type: flooded, gel-cell, or AGM. Both external-alternator regulators and AC-powered battery chargers are available with charging-mode selectors to match each battery type.

Many AC-powered battery chargers offer a manually selected or automatic “equalizing” charge mode that applies a higher than normal voltage at a controlled, low current to a lead-acid battery. Used about once a month, the equalizing charge will restore the active material in each cell to the maximum possible degree. The equalizing charge is best done when the batteries are not being used to power incandescent lights and must never be applied to gel-cell or AGM batteries.

#### Multiple Charging Sources & Battery Isolators

On boats with multiple batteries and one or more sources of DC-charging power (alternators and battery chargers), it is often desirable to be able to use one of the charging sources to serve at least two battery banks. An example of this is where one alternator is used to charge both the cranking battery and the “house battery”; see Figure 19-10. (Other systems might have two alternators and more than two batteries.) In order to accomplish this, battery isolators are available from a number of sources. These are devices containing diodes that permit the flow of current in one direction only so that the output of the alternator or battery charger can be directed to both batteries simultaneously. The isolator prevents one battery from being charged or discharged by the other battery. It is important to note, however, that the use of isolators introduces a slight voltage drop in the charging circuit and, unless the charging device’s output is adjusted higher, a little less than full charging will occur to the batteries.

Figure 19-10 Shown here is a basic wiring diagram for two batteries charged from a single engine alternator.

### Auxiliary Generating Plants (Gensets)

In addition to alternators that are belt driven by a propulsion engine for the production of DC power, a vessel may have one or more auxiliary generating plants, known as gensets. These supply AC power in either 120- or 240-volt systems; the normal frequency is 60 Hz, but some units can be operated at either 50 or 60 Hz.

Gensets are not connected to the vessel’s drive train, but comprise a large alternator that is close-coupled to a dedicated engine, which may be either a gasoline or diesel unit, chosen to match fuel used by the propulsion engines. Engines must operate at precisely controlled speeds to ensure that the AC current frequencies are constant and correct. AC load-sensing systems can provide automatic start/stop operation. Monitoring systems check both engine and electrical system operation and will shut the unit down if a fault is detected. Sound shield enclosures significantly reduce noise level, but their presence must not be allowed to interfere with frequent visual inspection and maintenance. Out of sight must not equal out of mind.

The advantage of a genset is that it can supply power for large, house-type electrical loads, while at the same time allowing a vessel to be independent of shorepower connections. The capacities of most manufacturers’ lines of gensets typically start at about 2.2kW (2,200 watts) and extend up to 30kW and higher; refer to Figure 19-05.

Although the AC produced by a genset cannot be used directly to charge a vessel’s storage batteries, it is possible to wire the genset so that it powers the same battery charger that would otherwise be driven by shorepower. In this way, any genset capacity in excess of the vessel’s immediate needs can be used to recharge its batteries at times when its propulsion engines are not being run.

There are also DC gensets that can be run to directly charge the vessel’s storage batteries.

### Alternative Energy Sources

Using a source of energy that does not require the combustion of fossil fuels can both extend a skipper’s cruising range and make him or her feel good for having relieved the environment of at least some hydrocarbon pollution. For boating applications, there may be some cost savings also from using the free energy of the sun and wind.

#### Solar Power

Sunlight can be converted into direct electricity by photovoltaic cells. The low voltage produced can be used to operate small electrical appliances—for instance, calculators and small ventilator fans. And a number of photovoltaic cells can be connected together in cased arrays called “solar panels” to charge, albeit in a limited way, a vessel’s storage batteries; see Figure 19-11.

Figure 19-11 Solar panels will provide small amounts of DC electrical power quietly and without the consumption of fuel. Flexible panels can be used in areas that are both convenient and out of the way.

In order to charge batteries, the voltage supplied by the solar-cell array must be about 3 volts higher than that of the boat’s battery system. In solar panels, an appropriate number of individual photovoltaic cells are, therefore, first connected in voltage-additive series. Then a number of these cell groups may be arrayed in current-additive parallel to provide greater amounts of energy; panels are normally rated in watts. It is necessary to install a regulator to control the charging of batteries.

Unfortunately, it’s often difficult to find enough deck space for enough panels to provide sufficient current for most shipboard devices. And most appliances whose current demands could be so satisfied directly do not find their major use at times when there is sunlight to be converted. For example, a solar panel of practical size for, say, a 35-foot sailboat, could run an electric lamp. But the lamp would be needed most at times when there is no sunlight available to power the solar panel. For that reason, and because solar panels are still relatively expensive when measured against unit output, the practical onboard application of solar power is limited and usually relegated to supplementary charging of storage batteries.

The initial high cost of solar panels is partially offset by the fact that they require little maintenance other than occasional cleaning. They are available in several types at different efficiencies and costs. Solar panels are rated for the most favorable conditions: cloudless skies, perfect angle of incidence, sun well above horizon, proper ambient temperature, and clean panel surface. Significantly less energy will be developed in more typical conditions. The location of panels is usually fixed, but it is often possible to adjust their orientation so as to be more nearly perpendicular to the sun’s rays. Typically, solar panels will not produce enough energy to fully replace that used during a 24-hour period, but they will reduce the amount that must be obtained from other sources. Newly developed panels can provide enough power to batteries to drive an electric-powered cruising boat at 5 or 6 knots for 5 or 6 hours.

#### Wind Generators

In recent years, significant strides have been made in the manufacture of wind-driven generators for boats. Strong, ultralight composite materials have become available for rotor blades and other structural parts, and compact, efficient alternators have been developed. As a result, wind-driven generators are available in sizes and weights that make them practical for installation aboard yachts and other small craft; see Figure 19-12.

Figure 19-12 Though noisier than solar panels, a wind generator, with its higher output in windy and less-than-perfect sunlight conditions, has become a symbol of electrical self-sufficiency among cruising sailors. They are even seen on some voyaging powerboats.

As an onboard source of electrical power, wind-driven generators offer important advantages over solar panels: They produce appreciable amounts of energy, and they work at night and on cloudy or rainy days. They are also less expensive than a typical group of solar panels. Most wind generators start to produce a charging current with winds of about six knots, with output at significant levels with winds of 15 knots. However, they also have disadvantages: They’re still relatively expensive for the amount of electrical power they develop, and they tend to be somewhat awkward looking unless their installation is carefully designed and executed. The whirling blades of wind generators annoy some people, but the location on a sailboat—up on the backstay or pole-mounted at the transom—is out of the way. They’re most useful at anchor, when a vessel is away from shorepower, lacks a genset, and is not running its propulsion engine(s). Consequently, they’re usually found on sailing craft, for if properly installed, they can be used underway when under sail alone. After all, there would be little point in utilizing a wind-driven generator on a powerboat underway, as the propulsion engine(s)-driven alternator(s) would provide many more times the amount of current at very little, if any, additional cost in fuel or engine wear.

Closely related, but seldom seen, are small hydrogenerators towed in the water astern. A small rotor revolves in the water flow much the same as the larger propeller of a wind generator; the craft must be making way through the water for power to be generated.

#### Fuel Cells

Well established as a source of electrical energy on shore and in space, fuel cells are a promising future source of power on boats as a replacement for gensets. Electrolysis is the familiar chemical process of using electrical energy to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen. Fuel cells work on the reverse process, combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity with water as a byproduct. They resemble batteries in that their DC electrical output is due to an electrochemical process, but they are producing energy, not storing it. Fuel cells get their oxygen input from a continuous stream of air. Hydrogen can be used directly, but is more easily and commonly obtained from fuels such as methane and methanol. Although hydrocarbons are used, there is no combustion and no polluting exhaust. Fuel cells are also unlike batteries in that their active elements are not consumed by the chemical reaction, and thus have a much longer service life. A fuel cell power module that uses methanol as its fuel source and delivers DC power at a voltage suitable for charging 12-volt batteries at the rate of 140 Ah per day sells for about $8,000. Virtually silent in operation, fuel cells may become compellingly attractive if the price drops significantly.

### Transforming Power

Electrical appliances have fairly specific power requirements. For instance, a 24-volt DC electric motor will not run properly on 12-volt DC current, but instead will run too slowly, overheat, and possibly even burn up. Similarly, 24 or 40 volts fed into charge a 12-volt battery will overcharge and destroy it. Further, AC appliances will not operate on DC, and vice versa.

Some DC electronic equipment and other appliances are equipped with internal power circuitry that tolerates input voltages from, say, 10 to 40 volts; but this kind of tolerance does not generally extend to AC/DC appliances, except in today’s onboard refrigeration systems and some other units that have the capacity to choose a higher voltage if both voltages are available (a refrigerator will choose 120 AC over 12 DC). And therefore, at times when the frequency and voltage characteristics of source currents do not match requirements of the equipment to be powered, it is necessary to employ a transformer (AC), an inverter (DC to AC), or a DC-DC converter.

#### Transformers

When a transformer is used simply to step up or step down the voltage of an AC system, without providing complete isolation from the shore-power system, it is known as a polarization transformer. If the transformer is connected so as to provide complete galvanic isolation from the shorepower system, then it is known as an isolation transformer. ABYC Standard E-11 contains a great deal of additional information on the subject of both of these types of transformers.

Transformers are most frequently used to step the voltage of AC systems either up or down, but in some circumstances they are used without voltage change in order to isolate a vessel’s onboard power system from a shorepower system. They can be so used because transformers magnetically couple their input and output circuits, creating current in the latter by induction rather than by a direct conductive connection.

#### Inverters

If a vessel is wired for 120-volt AC or higher voltage, it will likely have onboard appliances that are designed specifically for these voltages, which the crew will undoubtedly want to continue to use when away from a shorepower hookup. If the vessel has an auxiliary generating plant of sufficient capacity, then the necessary supply of 120- or 240-volt AC power is no problem. However, there are cases in which the boat is too small to accommodate a genset comfortably, and there may be times when the crew wants 120-volt AC without the additional noise and vibration of a running genset—which is always present to some extent, however well silenced and resiliently mounted the unit is. And in such instances, an inverter really shows its advantage.

The potential difference between the two wires in an AC power system varies continuously at a fixed rate: 60 times a second (60 Hz) in North America and much of the Western Hemisphere. The transition of the voltage from maximum positive to maximum negative occurs smoothly, following a sine wave pattern. The power delivered by most marine generator sets and the AC power from “sine wave” inverters conforms very closely to an ideal sinusoid and can efficiently power voltage waveform-sensitive loads such as required by the AC motors in marine air-conditioning systems. Inverters are also available that deliver “modified sine wave” power, a non-sinusoidal waveform that is less expensive to create than a pure sine wave and is suitable for powering many (but not all) of the AC consumers on boats. Devices that will operate satisfactorily from modified sine wave power include all resistive loads (hair dryers, toasters, coffee makers), and most small-motor-driven appliances, including AC-powered fans, most refrigerators, and small air conditioners. Consumers that may not work properly on modified sine wave power include some variable-speed power tools, sewing machines with microprocessor speed controls, certain medical equipment, and fluorescent lights with electronic ballasts.

Inverters are available with power ratings ranging from 20 to 150 watts: from an inverter module that plugs into a cigarette lighter outlet, to sine wave inverters that can continuously deliver more than 3,000 watts, to modified sine wave output units that can power 8,000-watt loads. Units designed for marine use are available in both pure and modified sine wave versions with automatic load sensing, built-in battery chargers, and automatic AC power transfer switches; see Figure 19-04.

The amount of AC power being delivered by an inverter determines the load being imposed on the boat’s battery, plus a small additional amount consumed by the inverter’s circuitry and a cooling blower (inverters are not 100% efficient; between 5% and 15% of the energy they draw from the battery is converted into heat). It is important to evaluate the impact of all electrical power consumption on a boat’s battery system. A small inverter used to power a TV set that consumes 100 watts of 120-volt AC power will place a 9.6-ampere load on a 12.2-volt (50% charged) battery. This DC power load will allow the TV to be used continually for about 4 hours from a typical, fully charged Group Size 27 deep-cycle battery. The DC current from a battery to an inverter powering a 5,000 BTU air conditioner will be in excess of 45 amperes. Operating a 1,500-watt hair dryer from the inverter will require a current of more than 136 amperes. Virtually all the power you may need to operate smaller AC appliances can be supplied from often surprisingly inexpensive inverters; however, supplying more than a modest amount of power or a large amount for a short time will require very large batteries or a continuous supply of 12-volt DC power from an engine-driven source.

Vessels equipped with shorepower systems can take advantage of combination inverter/battery charger units that will automate the boat’s AC power system. Equipped with automatic shore-power sensing circuits and switches, these units will deliver AC power from the on-shore source whenever it is available, automatically switching to supply power from the inverter if shorepower is not available. The system constantly monitors the state of charge of the battery and will warn if the energy remaining in the battery has decreased to a predetermined level and automatically shut off the inverter to protect the battery from excessive energy drain. The unit’s built-in, three-stage battery charger will automatically maintain the boat’s batteries at full charge whenever shorepower is available. Some units provide five battery charging “stages”: bulk, absorption, float charging, equalization (permissible only for flooded-cell batteries), and battery saver, an operating mode used when there will be little or no drain on the battery for a period of time. In this mode, the normally continuous float charge is interrupted so that no energy is supplied to the battery, avoiding loss of water from the electrolyte. When operating in this mode, the charger monitors the battery voltage, automatically restoring the float charge as necessary to maintain the battery at full charge.

Proper installation of powerful inverter/charger systems should only be undertaken by skilled personnel familiar with the requirements set out in ABYC Standards A-31 and E-11.

#### DC-DC Converters

Devices that take a higher DC voltage, such as 24 volts, and reduce it to a lower DC voltage, such as 12 volts, are called DC-DC converters. These are especially useful in powering certain items of electronic equipment that are generally available only in 12 volts when used on board vessels with 24-volt DC electrical systems. The DC-DC converter is preferable to a simple “dropping resistor” in that its output voltage is maintained at a constant level regardless of the connected load current.

### Connecting to Shorepower

The shorepower connection is sometimes derided as the boat’s “umbilical cord.” This is because some boaters (basically, those without gensets or inverters) are loath to break the shorepower connection and give up the convenience of “house-type” AC devices. The very nature of this disparagement indicates just how integrated the shore-to-ship power connection has become in boating today.

In North America, the voltage of shorepower is usually nominal 120, but may in some cases be nominal 240, so diligent care needs to be taken at all times in hooking up and using such power. Shorepower connections should be made only to properly wired and protected outlets.

Further, the vessel should be equipped with proper shorepower cords (with lock-type fittings and water-shedding boots and collars), appropriate inlet fittings, and a correctly configured main distribution panel with circuit breakers. The design of proper cords and inlet fittings ensures that neither skipper nor crew will ever handle a “live” cord with exposed (male end) prongs—as that is a certain invitation to potentially fatal electric shock.

In addition, it is advantageous if the vessel’s distribution panel has both a voltmeter and an ammeter to measure the incoming power in order to avoid overloading of the shorepower cord and connections and the shore circuit.

Properly wired AC outlets are found in a wide variety of configurations, each associated with particular combinations of voltage and current. For example, the size and pattern of 120-volt outlets with 15-, 30-, and 50-amp current capacities, respectively, differ from one another. And they all have configurations different from those of 240-volt outlets; refer to Figure 19-13.

Figure 19-13 Shorepower cords have a male connector at the landward end, shown here in the far-left column. The boat end is female and has the same wiring arrangement, which permits two cords to be connected end to end if necessary for a longer run. Sometimes, however, an adapter is required to fit between the power cord and a dissimilar shore outlet, such as the combinations shown at the bottom left. The configurations shown are for North America; electrical service in foreign locations may be different.

Moreover, because wiring codes are not consistent across the Unites States, and certainly not across international borders, the outlets at a strange wharf or marina may not match the end on your shorepower cord. Therefore, if you travel far afield and wish to connect to shore-power, it may be necessary to have aboard a variety of adapters that will allow connection of your shorepower cord to different types of dock outlets; refer to Figure 19-13.

Regardless of what adapters you must use in order to accommodate the dock outlets, always ensure that the grounding conductor (green wire) is connected to an outlet or metallic device that truly provides an effective ground. Many, but not all, adapters will do this internally. All too often one sees adapters where a grounding (green wire) “pigtail” is connected via its clip to a piece of plastic conduit or water pipe, or just left dangling. The grounding conductor is essential for the safety of persons on board and those in the water surrounding the vessel whenever the vessel is connected to shorepower; never sacrifice the grounding conductor’s integrity.

There are also adapters available (or which can be made up using proprietary, off-the-shelf parts) that can be used to split or merge circuits. For instance, if your boat has two 30-amp inlets but the shore outlet is a single 50-amp unit, a properly wired adapter can likely be used to split the 50-amp outlet into connections for two 30-amp cords. Or if your boat has a single 50-amp inlet and the shore two 30-amp outlets, the right adapter can be used to merge the two 30-amp outlets into a single 50-amp cord. There are adapters available that will match a 50-amp shore outlet to a 30-amp boat inlet without splitting. Conversely, there are adapters to match a 30-amp shore outlet to a 50-amp boat inlet, or a 15-amp shore outlet to a 30-amp boat inlet. It’s important to remember that there may not be sufficient current available in such a hookup to run high-demand appliances that may be on board.

Another way of protecting yourself and your boat’s electrical system is to verify the electrical connections on shore before hooking up. This is done with an outlet circuit tester; see Figure 19-14. Selling for just a few dollars, the instrument employs a combination of colored LEDs to indicate the following situations: correct wiring, open ground wire, open neutral wire, open hot wire, hot and ground reversed, and hot and neutral reversed. Some power cords now have built-in LED lights that, when the shore end is plugged in, will tell you whether the connection is safe or not.

Figure 19-14 The circuit tester shown here is one of many available types that can quickly diagnose a faulty wiring situation.

## DISTRIBUTING ELECTRICAL POWER

It is quite obvious that electrical power generated, stored, or brought aboard via a shore-power connection is of little value unless it can be distributed properly to various onboard appliances. Yet while much time, attention, and money are frequently spent on the source of onboard electricity, the distribution side of the system is almost as often given short shrift. And that’s a shame, because relatively modest efforts and expenditures in this area can go a long way toward ensuring the reliable and safe utilization of onboard electrical power.

Caution: Whenever 120-volt or 240-volt AC systems are installed on board, there is the possibility that, due to the failure of equipment or insulation somewhere in the future, AC voltage can inadvertently be applied to the vessel’s DC system. When and if this occurs, portions of the DC system, especially the engine and its propulsion system (which is connected via the battery negative), can now be energized at a potential of 120 volts AC above “ground.” This poses an imminent danger, not only to persons on board who may inadvertently contact such equipment but also to swimmers in the water, especially in freshwater areas, as they may be in the potential gradient or “field” created around the vessel.

In order to guard against this occurrence, the ABYC and NFPA Standards require the connection of the AC system grounding wire (green) to the DC system negative (ground) on board the vessel. This connection must be made on all vessels equipped with shorepower, other than those utilizing isolation transformers. The location of this connection should be ascertained, and its integrity checked on a regular basis. In years past, there have been articles written about disconnecting this circuit or “cutting” the green wire to shore to reduce the incidence of galvanic corrosion on board. This is not only improper but dangerous. There are other ways to combat galvanic corrosion when using shorepower; these are covered later in this chapter.

##### CHECKLIST FOR USING ADAPTERS

Whenever using adapters, the following three actions must always be followed:

✓ Outlet and adapter must be of the same voltage rating.

✓ Total amperage drawn should never be allowed to exceed the amperage of the lowest-rated component of the connection.

✓ Polarity and grounding connection must be maintained.

### Main Switches

The 12- or 24-volt DC and the 120-volt AC (or 240-volt AC, if applicable) subsystems should each be controlled by its own main switch that will cut power off entirely. This is an important protection, both for someone working on the system and in the event of an electrical or other fire, when it can be vitally important to be able to power down quickly and positively.

The one exception to this rule is the automatic bilge-pump circuit. This circuit should be wired so as to remain active even if the main switches are turned off—especially if it’s your practice, as it is with many boaters, to turn off the main switches whenever the boat is left unattended. That way, the protection of automatic bilge pumping will not be lost.

The main switch for the higher voltage subsystems (120 and 240 volts) will customarily be incorporated in the main distribution/circuit-breaker panel. However, since the 12- or 24-volt systems supply current to the engine starter(s), the main switch for these circuits necessarily has to carry very high currents (often 300 amps or more); consequently, it is imperative that the switch be of robust construction. The low-voltage main switch is, therefore, sometimes separated from the main distribution/circuit-breaker panel.

Main battery switches are often constructed to control two separate batteries or “banks.” Two or more batteries permanently wired in parallel can be referred to as a bank, or all of the batteries on a boat may be referred to as the battery bank. A typical switch will be labeled: Bat #1, BOTH (or ALL), Bat #2, OFF; see Figure 19-15. If, as is common, the selector switch is used to connect a battery to the engine’s starter, it should be set to either Battery #1 or Battery #2 when starting the engine. Using a single battery to start the engine will disclose a weakness in a battery that would go unnoticed if two batteries were used for starting. Switch to BOTH only in very cold conditions or if one or both batteries are weak.

Figure 19-15 A battery selector switch provides positive battery disconnect, isolates all circuits, and also protects against the hazards of electrical fire and explosions. It can be separate or combined with the circuit breakers for individual circuits.

#### Protecting the Alternator

The low-voltage main switches are often also wired to control the propulsion engine charging circuit, that is, starting current runs from the storage batteries to the starter(s) according to the setting of the switch, and charging current from the engine alternator(s) runs back to the battery or batteries according to the switch settings. Such an arrangement affords the advantage of being able to direct charging current to bank 1 or 2, or to both; see Figure 19-15.

The alternator on an operating engine must always be connected to a battery to prevent the alternator from producing high voltages that will destroy its internal rectifier diodes. Alternators must be “excited”—connected to an external voltage source (usually through the engine’s key switch)—to establish the magnetic field required for the generation of electrical power. Battery switches labeled “Alternator Protected” interrupt the alternator excitation power as the selector is moved to the “Off” position, protecting the alternator from damage if the “Off” position is selected with the engine running.

However, most battery switches carry a warning label: “Do Not Turn OFF When Engine Is Running” and are “make-before-break” switches. A battery is always connected to the alternator except in the “off” position. Make-before-break switches may therefore be moved from one battery to another when the engine is operating without risk to the alternator. Additional security for the alternator can be obtained by installing a solid-state voltage-limiting device (usually called a Zapstop) on the alternator. Connected between the alternator’s output “S” terminal and the alternator’s ground “G” terminal, the device will prevent excessive voltage in the event something interrupts the connection to a battery (including a cable failure).

If the propulsion-engine charging circuit is wired in such a way that it bypasses the main switch and goes directly to the storage batteries, the above precautions may not be necessary. However, it is always desirable to be able to select individual batteries for use when no charging system is operating, reserving a charged battery for engine starting service. Battery charging can then be managed manually or with an automatic paralleling system.

### The Distribution Panel

The electrical distribution panel houses the main power switches for the boat’s low-voltage DC and the AC power selector switches. It also houses the circuit breakers or fuses that protect the branch circuit wiring, which distributes power to all of the boat’s electrical equipment and convenience outlets. Switch-type circuit breakers serve both to control a circuit and to protect against excessive current flow in the circuit. The current rating of each of the branch circuit breakers or fuses is determined by the allowable current-carrying capacity of the wires used in that circuit. Substitution of breakers or fuses with devices rated for higher current than those originally installed can create a serious fire hazard.

Fuses provide overcurrent protection by means of the destruction of an internal metal strip that melts when a predetermined amount of current is drawn through it. Fuses are less expensive initially, but are a one-time-use device. Circuit breakers, although more expensive, perform the same function but are resettable after the problem in the circuit has been corrected. Except in the smallest, least expensive boats, circuit breakers are today almost universally used in preference to fuses, at least when it comes to main distribution panels and when currents of 5 amps or greater are involved. Virtually all DC-powered electronic equipment is supplied with some type of in-line fuse. The fuse serves to protect the connecting wiring, not the device itself, which may have additional internal fuses or other protective devices. Electronic engine management systems and computers are also protected by fuses.

Fuses of the correct size offer safe onboard circuit protection. However, fuses have several disadvantages as compared to circuit breakers:

• When a fuse blows, it is more difficult to replace it than simply to reset a circuit breaker.

It is dangerously easy to replace a blown fuse with an improper one of excess current-carrying capacity.

• If a fuse blows and no replacement is handy, there is the temptation to shunt it with a length of wire, a practice that often leads to fire.

• In damp corrosive atmospheres, fuse clips tend to corrode, offering a high-resistance connection that results in voltage drop.

The main distribution panel is used to distribute current to various onboard circuits. There may be separate panels for DC and AC, or these can be combined; see Figure 19-16. For each of these, heavy conductors are brought to a heavy bus bar on the panel. Branch (or sub-) circuits are then wired on the panel from the bus bar through an appropriately rated circuit breaker, which is often also used as a switch for that branch circuit. In this way, circuit faults usually result in the “tripping” of a breaker on the labeled main distribution panel, and are therefore easier to trace and correct. The use of a main distribution panel also facilitates checking the on/off condition of various circuits. Trip-free circuit breakers are a recommended protective component for onboard application. These are designed so that the reset handle cannot be manually held to override the current interrupting mechanism—this makes “cheating” on the breaker impossible.

Figure 19-16 Shown here are front and back views of a combined AC and DC distribution panel. Note the careful labeling of each switch and circuit breaker. This panel also includes a transfer switch for changing from shorepower to the onboard auxiliary generating plant.

An Important Caution: When the low-voltage and higher-voltage distribution panels are combined into a single unit or located in close proximity to each other, it is critical to make sure that no inadvertent cross-connections are made. Any such cross-connections would result in feeding 120- or 240-volt current into the vessel’s 12- or 24-volt system. This in turn could cause at least the destruction of low-voltage equipment. In the worst-case scenario, it could cause fire or the electrocution of a crewmember or a swimmer.

### The Wiring System

If the battery and alternator are the heart of a boat’s electrical system, then the wires supplying power to the various electrical and electronic loads are the arteries and veins. The wires must be heavy enough—of sufficient cross-sectional area—to carry the current of the loads connected to the circuit.

Adequate wire size is determined by two factors: heating effect and voltage drop. Current passing through a wire increases its temperature; obviously, it must not become hot enough to become a fire hazard. As a general rule, a wire should not become warm to the touch when carrying its full load.

The voltage drop problem is the more common one. The heating losses mentioned above result in a lower voltage being delivered to the load than was put into the circuit at the battery. The voltage drop increases with an increase in the load, being directly proportional to the current in the circuit, and with an increase in the length of the wires.

#### The Right Size & Type of Wires

Many potential problems can be avoided by ensuring that all wiring is adequate in size for the amperage involved. Although it usually can be safely assumed that a boat will have the proper size and type of wiring when it is delivered from the manufacturer, it is highly likely that additional equipment and accessories will be installed in the craft throughout its active life. Electrical problems encountered with new gear are often traceable to the inadequacy of the original wiring. Thus a boat owner must know the correct wiring practices to support the added devices.

The higher the current (amperage) draw of a device, the heavier the wire that carries the current has to be. Insufficient wire size (diameter) means increased resistance. Excessively high resistance results in greater voltage drop (less voltage at the device) as well as greater heat. This results, at best, in a loss of efficiency (with power being lost in the conversion of electrical energy to heat), and at worst, in damage to electric motors and other appliances—even, in extreme cases, fire. Any wire, when subjected to excessive current, may overheat to the point of igniting adjacent combustible materials. It is for this reason that circuit breakers or fuses are utilized to limit the amount of current that can be loaded on a wire. Voltage drop also increases with the length of the circuit—the distance from the battery (or distribution panel) to the load device and back.

It’s important to keep in mind that wire sizes in North America are generally specified according to American wire gauge (AWG) standards, under which a lower number designates a larger diameter (for example, No. 10 AWG wire is heavier than No. 16 AWG). The system is established so that a change of three numbers, either up or down, changes the cross-section area of the wire by a factor of two; this doubles, or halves, the resistance of the wire (but odd numbers are generally not used in small gauges). A change of six numbers changes the area and resistance by a factor of four; as resistance decreases, current-carrying capacity increases by the same factor.

When electrical wiring is in a marine environment, size is not the only consideration—wire type is also very important.

Wire with a solid conductor, or less than sixteen strands, should not be used on a boat because it is prone to fracture due to vibration, especially where the conductor may have been nicked when stripping the insulation for connection during installation. Instead, flexible, multistrand wire should be chosen for all systems.

It is recommended that pretinned copper conductors be used in boat wiring, even though it is relatively expensive. Conductor strands that are coated with tin resist corrosion much better than bare copper ones. That’s important not only at terminal fittings, where the copper is stripped of its insulation so that it can be inserted into crimp-type or other terminal fittings, but all along the conductor. The type of corrosion to which copper is subject in a salt-damp environment has a tendency to “creep” along bare copper wires, up under its protective insulation, and so plain copper conductor is potentially subject to severe and hidden corrosion when used in the marine environment.

The type of insulation is also important. In the engine compartment it should be a type that is resistant to oil, gasoline or diesel, and other petroleum products.

#### Recommended Wire Gauges

In DC systems, typically 12- or 24-volt, the voltage drop that occurs due to the resistance of the wire becomes a critical consideration for certain types of equipment. ABYC recommends that “noncritical” applications (for example, where the voltage drop does not seriously compromise the function of the equipment, such as motors, cabin lights, etc.) be limited to 10 percent. “Critical” devices, such as navigation lights, bilge blowers, and most electronics equipment, should have a voltage drop of not more than 3 percent. The ABYC E-11 Standards provide details and tables for these calculations; see Tables 19-1 and 19-2.

Table 19-1 A 10 percent voltage drop can be tolerated by common electrical components. The American Boat & Yacht Council (ABYC) standards for noncritical loads, such as lights and pumps, are shown in the above table. All wires should be stranded to reduce the possibility of failure from mechanical fatigue.

Table 19-2 Electronic devices, such as radios and navigation equipment, are less tolerant of voltage drops in the wires supplying power to them than are common electrical loads—the ABYC standards call for a drop of not more than 3 percent. The necessary wire sizes are shown above for current drains and various lengths of wires.

A simple check of equipment “as installed” can be made by using a DC voltmeter; first read the voltage at the fuse or breaker panel, then at the equipment itself. This must be done with all “normal” loads turned on and the DC charging source (engine or battery charger) operating. Additionally, the equipment under test must be running, in other words, pumping water with bilge pump or transmitting on the radio. If 13.2 volts were available at the distribution panel, then 12.8 volts (13.2 minus 3 percent of 13.2) should be the reading at the equipment for no more than a 3 percent drop.

#### Wiring Identification

In addition to having the right size and type of wires, the proper color coding of wiring should be observed without fail to facilitate the identification of circuits and the tracking of wires during troubleshooting procedures; see Table 19-3.

Table 19-3 ABYC Standard E-11 provides a system of color coding for the identification of wiring on small craft.

Identification should also be ensured with a complete wiring diagram that can be understood by a nonexpert. Enclose it in plastic and post it near the main switch panel. Keep it up to date as additions and changes are made. Proper terminal connections, bundling, and support of the wire runs should always be provided for in order to minimize the potential for failures due to corrosion (connections lying loose in wet bilges) and failures due to mechanical problems (connections pulling loose under the substantial weight of wiring or due to vibration).

#### Wiring & the Compass

Wiring that supplies DC current to the compass’s night-light and all other DC wiring in proximity to a vessel’s autopilot heading sensor is a potential cause of serious magnetic deviation. When carrying current, such wiring can be the source of magnetic fields that will interfere with the proper functioning of the compass.

Even worse, because electrical circuits are sometimes on and sometimes off, and because the magnetic fields they generate change with variations in current, the magnetic interference they produce is sporadic and variable. Therefore, this form of magnetic deviation cannot generally be eliminated by compensating the compass, and so it is necessary to take a preventive, rather than a corrective, approach to the problem.

The primary preventive measure is to keep all DC wiring at least 3 feet—and preferably 6 feet—away from the vessel’s magnetic compass (and the sensing unit of an autopilot). Obviously, that is not always possible, particularly in the case of wiring that runs to the compass’s own night lighting. Wiring that cannot be routed well away from the compass should be run in twisted pairs; that is, each DC feed wire should be paired with a DC return wire and the two tightly (not loosely) twisted round and round together. This procedure will cause the magnetic field of one wire to be “canceled” by the field of the other.

The wiring installation should always be checked as a safety measure. You can do this by observing the compass while you switch the involved circuit first on, then off. If the wires have been properly twisted, the compass card will not react. However, if the wires have not been properly paired and twisted, the card will shift quite rapidly to a new heading each time the circuit is switched.

## ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES & EQUIPMENT

Clearly, electrical appliances are a boon for today’s boater. Indeed, the convenience they afford is one of the two major reasons for having electrical power on board—the other being the use of modern sophisticated electronic navigation and communications equipment. Electrical appliances can, however, also be a bane, for unless properly chosen and installed, they will deteriorate and break down quickly, as well as cause problems for critical electronics. The prudent skipper will, therefore, refer to the installation standards promulgated by such organizations as ABYC and NFPA and, in all cases, pay strict attention to the recommendations of the manufacturers of the equipment in question.

Just as for application ashore, choose electrical equipment that bears the listing mark of Underwriters Laboratories (UL) whenever possible. Underwriters Laboratories Marine lists certain devices, especially electrical equipment, intended specifically for installation on board vessels. These listed devices should be used whenever there is a choice of equipment.

### Microwave Ovens

For onboard use, microwave ovens offer some significant advantages over conventional electric ovens and ranges because they reduce cooking time, hence power consumption. They also reduce the amount of heat released into the surrounding cabin, which improves the comfort of the crew and, if the boat is simultaneously being air conditioned, further reduces overall power consumption.

Microwave ovens are available in different sizes and wattage ratings. The larger ovens are usually more powerful (faster cooking) and require more current, but not in all cases, so it is important to check wattage ratings carefully when comparing units of the same physical size. Beyond that, choice of preferred size and wattage is determined basically by the same cooking considerations pertinent to shoreside applications, although final selection is limited by a number of other considerations relating specifically to onboard use.

First, on all but the largest yachts, galley space is relatively limited in comparison to onshore applications—so it may not be possible to fit in a full- or apartment-size microwave; see Figure 19-17.

Figure 19-17 A properly selected and installed microwave oven, as shown here above the stove, reduces cooking time, lessens heat generated, and generally enhances life afloat.

Second, unless the craft is fitted with a genset, supplying AC for the microwave can be a problem when shorepower is not available—for example, at anchor. Yet such times are precisely when microwave cooking affords the greatest advantages. Consequently, it may be important to make sure that the unit can be powered by an existing inverter, and that there is sufficient storage battery capacity to supply current. For example, a 1,000-watt unit set on high power will draw about 8.33 amps at 120 volts. Assuming that the inverter has an efficiency of 85 percent (with 15 percent of the input energy lost to heat), the current draw on a 12-volt battery will be about 96 to 98 amps—a pretty heavy load that would deeply discharge the average deep-cycle battery in less than half an hour.

##### MAKING THE CONNECTION: TERMINAL FITTINGS

In marine applications, winding a bared, twisted end of a conductor around the terminal screw on an appliance, circuit breaker, or bus bar just won’t do. In fact, this practice is prohibited by industry standards. Such a connection is simply too prone to corrosion and to loosening due to vibration. Instead, some form of terminal fitting should be employed, one which provides a flanged fork (spade)—or even better, a ring—end that makes for a secure mechanical connection.

At one time, terminal fittings were soldered to the wire, but that procedure is both time-consuming and expensive; crimp fittings are now almost universally used. These are tinned copper fittings consisting of a tubular shank with a plastic sheathing at one end of which is a fork or a ring. The sheathing extends up over the wire insulation. The best-quality sheathing is nylon. Unlike the cheaper PVC, nylon will not crack or punch through when crimped, and resists the corrosive effects of ultraviolet (UV) light, oil, or fuel.

The stripped end of the wire is inserted into the tubular shank of the fitting, and a special tool is used to squeeze the shank tightly around the conductor. The fitting must be of the proper size for the wire used, and the plastic sheath must not be broken when squeezed.

If properly done, the connection, although mechanical, is excellent and long-lasting. And if pretinned copper wire is used, and the terminals are tinned, the potential for corrosion between the wire and the crimped shank of the fitting is minimal.

It is possible to solder a crimped fitting after it has been crimped. But this is not preferred practice, as the heat will usually destroy the insulation that protects the shank on the crimp fitting. Additionally, the solder will “wick” part of the way up past the crimped fitting and, effectively, destroy the flexibility of the stranded wire, tending to make it stiff and prone to breakage from the vibration that exists on all boats. And where enhanced resistance to corrosion is desired, it is beneficial to coat the terminal with one of the liquid vinyl compounds available for that purpose, or to employ modern vinyl heat-shrunk tubing.

Shrink tubing is applied by sliding a piece of appropriately sized material over the wire before crimping the terminal on. After crimping, the tubing is slipped into position so that it covers the shank of the crimp fitting and overlaps onto the wiring insulation. The assembly is then heated with a heat gun or a portable hair dryer, whereupon the tubing shrinks tightly to the contours of the wire and fitting, at the same time exuding a sealant/adhesive that seals the underlying connection from moisture intrusion. A more recent (and convenient) variation of this approach is a combination crimp and heat-shrink terminal fitting, which is first crimped in the normal manner, then heated.

Both standard crimp fittings and these combination crimp/heat-shrink fittings are also available in configurations for joining two, three, or four wire ends; these are commonly called butt connectors. There are also other specialized terminals, such as the male/female pairs termed “quick-disconnect.”

1 Strip the wire of its insulation and slip it into the crimp fitting—a ring or a fork. Then squeeze the crimp with a special tool until exactly the right dimension is achieved.

2 Slide a length of heat-shrink tubing (available in several sizes) over the crimp.

3 Shrink the protective tubing with gentle heating. A hair dryer is effective, as is the gentle flame of a lighter.

In contrast, if the microwave were a 700-watt unit used for appropriately light duty, the battery draw would be about 58 amps, and since microwave cooking is, happily, fast, the 10 or so minutes needed would probably only discharge the vessel’s batteries by about 7 to 8 amp-hours. And naturally, if the unit were in use on a powerboat underway, that amount of power would easily be supplied by the propulsion engine alternator(s) without a drain on the storage batteries.

Microwave ovens can be relatively heavy and need to be securely mounted. It’s also critical to make sure that they have sufficient ventilation, as lack of cooling ventilation is probably one of the most frequent causes of failure in onboard use. Therefore, if the unit is being built in or enclosed in a locker, ventilation holes of adequate size should be cut in its enclosure.

### Refrigeration & Air-Conditioning

Refrigerators and air-conditioning units that use sealed, electrically driven compressors are probably among the most, if not the most, reliable pieces of equipment to be found on board. One reason for this is that they incorporate shore-based technology that has reached a high level of refinement. In these units, the compressor motor is sealed inside the condenser casing with the compressor itself, and so is protected from the ravages of the marine environment. If a fresh desiccant cartridge is soldered into the refrigerant circuit when it’s first charged, and the system remains sealed, the basic unit will last for years without the need of attention, even if run continuously; see Figure 19-18.

Figure 19-18 Air conditioners, such as shown above, are usually found only on medium-size and large craft operating on 120-volt AC from shorepower or gensets. There are models for smaller boats that can be powered from 12-volt DC, but these place a heavy load on the batteries.

This is not necessarily true of certain peripheral components, such as the evaporator fans and the electric pumps that supply cooling water to the condenser unit in water-cooled systems. But again, in the better systems, even these components are rated for years of operational life, even under frequent use over extended periods of time.

The important thing to remember about refrigeration and air-conditioning units is that their compressor motors draw starting current (amperage) that is at least twice, and can be as much as three times, their rated current draw when running. This means, for example, that a 12,000 BTU air-conditioning system that is rated at 6.8 amps at 120 volts may momentarily draw 21 or more amps each time the compressor starts up. It’s critical to take this into account when matching gensets, inverters, wiring, and circuit breakers to such systems; it is also necessary to consider which other heavy-drain devices may be running when an air-conditioning system is switched on.

### Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters

There are occasions when, due to faulty wiring, terminals, or other defects in a circuit, current will escape its normal (safe) path and head directly to ground via some other conductor. The condition is called a “ground fault” in an AC circuit. If the external conductor happens to be your body, you can be in big trouble, especially if heavy current manages to pass through your heart. A ground fault circuit interrupter, or GFCI as it has come to be known, senses such a ground fault before any potentially injurious amount of current can be conducted, and in a fraction of a second breaks (interrupts) the power to the faulty circuit.

GFCIs are available in different sizes and capacities, some portable and some designed to be wired into the electrical distribution system; see Figure 19-19. No vessel with 120 or higher voltage on board should be without appropriate GFCIs in its distribution system. Standards call for GFCIs to be installed in all heads, galleys, machinery spaces, and on weather decks; any unit installed in the engine compartment of a gasoline-fueled boat must also be ignition protected (see below). Portable GFCIs should be employed as necessary on deck and on dock—indeed, anywhere near the water or where one might be showered upon—whenever electrical tools are employed. This caution simply cannot be overstated: Numerous fatalities have resulted from the failure to take these precautions and from electrical tools dropping in water or developing wiring faults while the operator was standing in a puddle or was otherwise well grounded.

Figure 19-19 A ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) is designed to protect people from line-to-ground electrical shock hazards that may develop from faulty appliances, tools, or cords.

Caution: Most GFCIs are not listed as “ignition protected” devices and, in order to avoid an explosion hazard, should not be installed in the engine room or fuel tank areas of gasoline-powered vessels. Additional information about the use and installation of GFCI’s is covered in ABYC Standard E-11, AC & DC Electrical Systems on Boats.

## PROTECTING YOUR BOAT & EQUIPMENT

Properly directed and controlled, electrical power can be a tremendous asset in the safe operation of a vessel. But stray or uncontrolled electrical currents can be destructive to both hull and gear, as well as potentially very dangerous to the crew and those who may be in proximity to the boat, whether in the water or out.

### Ignition Protection

By their very nature, many electrical devices spark or “arc” in their normal operation; switches, relays, engine starters, and many DC motors and alternators are all examples of such devices. In the presence of gasoline or propane vapors, this “arc” can produce sufficient energy to ignite the vapors and produce a violent explosion.

In order to prevent this, the USCG, the ABYC, and the NFPA all require that electrical devices be ignition protected if they are to be installed in engine compartments or fuel tank compartments on gasoline-powered vessels. In addition, NFPA and ABYC have extended these ignition protection requirements to boats equipped with propane under certain conditions. There are various equipment test standards for ignition protection, including the Society of Automotive Engineers Standard SAE J1171 and Underwriters Laboratories Standard UL 1500. When installing or replacing any electrical component in compartments where vapors may be present, it is imperative that the component has been tested under one of these standards and the product itself is marked “ignition protected” or bears one of these two standard numbers.

### Safe Battery Installation

Storage batteries must be installed in a ventilated area so that gases generated during charging will be dissipated safely. They should also be protected from extreme heat and cold and from spray. Starting batteries must be close to the engines in order to have short starter cables, thus reducing the voltage drop in the cables. Gasoline fumes are explosive, and any spark from a battery connection is dangerous. Gasoline fumes should be kept away from the battery installation.

Batteries must be secured against shifting as well as against vertical motion that would allow them to pound. They should be chocked on all sides and supported by a nonabsorbent material that will not be affected by contact with electrolyte. Air should circulate all around the battery. A tray of fiberglass or other electrolyte-proof material must protect aluminum and steel surfaces of the boat.

Batteries should be accessible for inspection, cleaning, testing, and adding water to maintain the level of the electrolyte (wet-cell batteries only). They should also be covered with a nonconductive material so that a dropped wrench or other tool will not short-circuit the terminals. These covers must have sufficient small holes to allow the escape of any gases from charging; see Figure 19-07.

Caution: Salt water reacts with battery acid to form chlorine gas, which can be deadly.

### Preventing Electrolytic Corrosion Damage

A boat owner must take precautions against electrical corrosion, also called “electrolysis.” There are three major forms of this—galvanic corrosion, onboard stray-current corrosion, and external stray-current corrosion. Although the electrochemical results are generally similar, these all have different causes and require different protective actions.

#### Galvanic Corrosion Principles

When two metals with widely differing electrical potential (voltage) are connected electrically and immersed in an electrolyte—that is, a current-carrying liquid such as salt water—a natural battery is formed. When that happens, direct current flows in the circuit comprised of the metal parts, the electrical connection, such as a bonding wire (see below) or a metal hull skin, and the electrolyte.

Different metals have different electric potentials as measured against a standard reference half-cell; the voltages for various metals in seawater are shown in Table 19-4. The difference in potential between any two metals determines the relative strength of the current flow and its direction. The metals with the lowest potential are variously termed the “most noble” or “most passive” and act as the cathode in a galvanic circuit. On the other end of the scale are metals that have higher potentials and are termed “least noble” or “most active”; these serve as the anode.

Table 19-4 In the galvanic series of metals in seawater, the metals with the lower potential are variously termed the “less active” or “more noble” and act as the cathode in a galvanic circuit. On the other end of the scale (the top of this table) are metals that have higher potentials, termed “more active” or “less noble”; these serve as the anode.

The direction of this current has important implications for the longevity of a vessel’s underwater and bilge-mounted metal parts (including the hull if it is metal). In the segment of the circuit that is formed by the electrolyte (seawater), current flows from the anode to the cathode. This causes an anode to progressively disintegrate through the process of electrolysis; this is known as galvanic corrosion.

If the natural current in this circuit is supplemented by the introduction of current from an external source—for example, from an electrical wire that is shorting directly to ground—the rate of the anode’s deterioration will be greatly accelerated. The natural galvanic corrosion is enhanced by the external current. The insulation on wiring should be protected from chafing and maintained in good general condition; wires should never be allowed to be in contact with bilge water. Each DC electrical device should have its own return wire of the same size as the “hot” wire returning directly to the negative bus at the distribution panel.

#### Protection Using Passive Anodes

The terms “anode” and “cathode” are relative. In any galvanic circuit, the metal with the higher electrical potential acts as the anode, while the metal with the lower potential acts as the cathode. Aluminum hull plating, for instance, will act as an anode relative to a copper radio grounding plate, which will be the cathode. However, a bar of pure zinc would be an anode relative to both the aluminum housing and the copper grounding plate. The traditional method for protecting critical underwater parts is to bond them all together in a single circuit that includes one or more special sacrificial anodes; see Figure 19-20. When a piece of zinc of adequate volume and surface area is included in a galvanic circuit, the higher voltage of the zinc overcomes the tendency of current to flow away from other metal parts in the circuit. Instead, current flows from the zinc to those parts that are more noble, thereby protecting them at the cost of the erosion of the zinc. (Aluminum anodes are becoming popular, but are often called zincs.) Magnesium anodes work well in fresh water (do not use in salt or brackish water); never mix anodes of different metals. Caution: Never paint an anode; doing so would isolate it from the water, preventing its protective action.

Figure 19-20 Sacrificial zinc anodes should be placed on shafts, rudders, and the hull. These will do much to prevent galvanic corrosion. They should be expected to progressively deteriorate; periodic inspection and replacement is required for full effectiveness.

A bonding system can be installed to connect all metal hull fittings exposed to bilge water or external water together, and to the external zinc electrode. Connections to the bonding system must be checked regularly; see Figure 19-21. Bonding is a controversial topic, and it may not be justified in a nonmetallic hull if the underwater metals are galvanically compatible.

Figure 19-21 A heavy copper strap run from one end of a boat to the other end will serve as a common bonding conductor. It is not to be used as a part of the return path of electrical power to DC equipment. Individual bonding conductors must be #8 AWG or larger. If copper strap is used, it must be at least 1/32″ (0.8 mm) thick and not less than ½″ (13 mm) wide. In the approach shown here—often recommended—through hulls are isolated from the bonding system, whereas the radio ground plate (also serving as lightning ground) is bonded. Engines are bonded, but prop shafts may be isolated via flexible couplings and individually protected as needed with zincs.

Since zincs are cheaper and easier to replace than critical metal parts such as propellers, shafts, hull plating, and the like, this preventative for galvanic corrosion has, through the years, been almost universally used. Unfortunately, the use of static sacrificial zinc anodes doesn’t always work as well as intended. The area of wetted surface of the zinc or zincs is critical: If too small, the desired effect of reversing destructive current flow will not be achieved.

Placement is also critical. If the zincs are too distant from the part or parts that require protection, the voltage of the zinc will not be able to overcome the resistance of the current path through the electrolyte; and therefore, the zinc(s) will fail to reverse potentially destructive galvanic currents in the region of the critical part or parts.

For both of these reasons, systems that provide more “active” corrosion protection have been developed in the last few years. These are impressed-current systems that sense and work actively to overcome potentially destructive voltage differentials. These systems divide into two types described below: anodic and cathodic.

#### Active Anodic Protection

Anodic impressed-current systems overcome the problems of size and anode-to-cathode distance, which frequently occur in a traditional arrangement of “static” sacrificial zincs. These anodic systems incorporate an electronic controller that senses voltage and/or current flow in a galvanic circuit. The controller then works to ensure that sufficiently high voltage is present on the system’s sacrificial anode(s) by supplying current from an external source (such as the boat’s battery) to the anode(s). And this in turn ensures that critical underwater metal parts are at all times in a cathodic (noncorroding) condition.

#### Active Cathodic Protection

Cathodic impressed-current systems also incorporate an electronic controller, which senses the voltages and/or currents present in any galvanic couples. However, in cathodic systems, the controller uses external power to boost the voltage of a dedicated cathode to the point where that voltage is equal to the voltage of the anodes in the circuit. Then, since all metal parts in the galvanic circuit are at the same electrical potential, there is no current flow. Cathodic systems thus block the passage of destructive galvanic currents.

One system, such as, for example, Mercury Marine’s Quicksilver MerCathode system, electronically measures the voltage of a boat’s submerged critical metal parts, in particular, the aluminum sterndrive housing found on many smaller craft. Utilizing current from the boat’s battery, it raises the voltage of a permanent, submerged titanium electrode (the cathode) so that it equals the voltage of the endangered part or parts (which become the anodes). With the titanium electrode and the otherwise endangered metal parts at the same electrical potential, there is no current flow, and thus no galvanic corrosion.

#### Avoid Dissimilar Metals

But whether a traditional system of sacrificial zincs is employed, or a more modern impressed-current system, the sensible boater still avoids, to the greatest extent practicable, mixing galvanically incompatible metals. Bronze through-hulls, for example, must not be used in direct contact with aluminum or steel hull plating. Instead, Type 316 stainless steel is often used, as it is much closer to aluminum and steel on the galvanic scale (thus there is less natural voltage differential between the two); refer to Table 19-4. Even better, nonconductive fiber-reinforced plastic fittings are sometimes used in smaller metal boats to completely eliminate the danger; such plastic fittings, however, are not generally available in sizes suitable for larger vessels.

#### Internal Stray Currents

Less common, but still possible, is corrosion caused by stray currents within a boat. If two pieces of metal in the bilge are at different potentials, possibly as a result of faulty wiring or poor connection to a bonding system (or lack of such a connection), current can flow from one to the other even if they are of the same metal. This action will result in metal being eaten away from the metal at the higher potential.

Zincs are of no use in such situations. The obvious prevention measures are careful initial wiring of all electrical equipment that might operate in or near bilge water (currents can flow across moist surfaces as well as in liquids), and the continued maintenance of both wire insulation and connections through regular checks.

#### External Stray Currents

If natural galvanic corrosion is an illness, electrolytic corrosion enhanced by an external current is a plague. The most common offenders are improperly wired shoreside electrical hookups and items of onboard equipment that are leaking current directly to the ground (the water) or to the boat’s bonding system through shorted or defectively insulated internal components and/or bad wiring.

Correct Polarity Many shorepower-related electrolytic problems can be avoided by making certain that there is correct “polarity” when plugging in—that is, that the black wire is hot, the white is the neutral (in a 120-volt system), and the green wire is connected to ground. Your boat’s 120- or 240-volt main distribution panel may incorporate a reverse-polarity indicator, but such a unit provides less information and, ultimately, less protection than a simple and inexpensive handheld indicator, of the type used by electricians; refer to Figure 19-14. What you really need to watch out for is a case in which improper shorepower wiring ends up with the current running to ground through the green wire, rather than through the white neutral wire.

Using an Isolation Transformer Additional protection can be had by incorporating, whenever possible, some form of “isolator” in any ship-to-shore electrical connection. In this respect, the best solution is an isolation transformer that will eliminate any direct conductive connection between the shorepower source and a vessel’s electrical system. As previously mentioned on this page, such transformers do not step the voltage up or down. Instead, they produce current for the boat’s distribution system via a magnetic connection (induction) with the shorepower input. Unfortunately, isolation transformers are relatively large and heavy; they are also expensive. For these practical reasons, they are used for the most part only on larger yachts.

Using a Galvanic Isolator Where an isolation transformer is not practical for reasons of space or cost, one useful alternative is to install a “galvanic isolator” in the shorepower connection ground (green) line. These relatively inexpensive units work to isolate the boat’s grounding system from the shorepower ground and, therefore, they help alleviate the potential for electrolytic corrosion. Since the galvanic isolator is connected in series with the AC system grounding conductor (green wire) to shore, it is imperative that the isolator meet certain minimum standards; otherwise the integrity of the grounding conductor will be compromised, if not lost completely. These requirements are reflected in ABYC Standard E-11, AC & DC Electrical Systems On Boats. The only way you can be sure that you are complying with these standards is by using only galvanic isolators that bear the Underwriters Laboratories Marine listing mark.

# CHAPTER20

Figure 20-01 A VHF/DSC marine radio should be the first item of electronic equipment for your boat—you will find many uses for it, but always use it in accordance with the FCC Rules. Smaller craft and dinghies can well use a handheld transceiver—less powerful, but with many features of an installed set.

COMMUNICATIONS

Basic Radio Terminology • The Marine Radio System • VHF Radio Service • MF-HF Single Sideband Radio Service • The Global Maritime Distress & Safety System (GMDSS) • Other Radio Communications • Other Means of Communications

The compact size, low power demand, and waterproof design of today’s marine electronics make it possible for any size boat to be equipped with a complete set of navigation and communication gear.

From a safety viewpoint, always essential in boating, the first priority of purchase and installation in almost all cases will be a VHF/DSC radio for communications; see Figure 20-01. Other types of radios are also installed and used sometimes for specialized purposes. These include medium-frequency (MF) and high-frequency (HF) single sideband (SSB) radios for longer range communications; amateur radio equipment, which can serve many purposes for boaters; citizens band (CB) sets for communications that are not allowed on the marine service; and newer systems, such as Family Radio Service (FRS), General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS), satellite phones, marine satellite communication systems, and cell phones, often using special marine range extending amplifiers.

## BASIC RADIO TERMINOLOGY

Unless you are interested in obtaining an advanced (marine or general) radiotelephone operator’s license, it’s not necessary to delve deeply into the physics of radio transmission. For most boat owners, it’s sufficient simply to understand a few very basic principles and distinctions, and to treat the rest in “black box” fashion—that is, to interface with marine radio as an intelligent user who is conversant with correct operating procedures, and without significant reference to what actually transpires inside the equipment. You will need to be familiar with certain characteristics of radio communications to understand the proper selection, installation, licensing, and use of radiotelephones.

These characteristics include frequency bands, types of modulation, power, antenna requirements, and operating range. Almost all radios for small craft combine the transmitter and receiver into a single unit, the proper but seldom used name of which is transceiver.

#### Frequency Bands

Radio energy is generated and transmitted as waves with specific physical characteristics. For our purposes, the two most important of these are amplitude (the height of the wave from trough to crest), a measure of power, and frequency (the rapidity with which the crests of the waves arrive at a given point). The unit of frequency equal to one cyle per second is a hertz (Hz). Frequency is today universally expressed in kilohertz (kHz), where 1 kHz = 1,000 Hz, and megahertz (MHz), where 1 MHz = 1,000 kHz; satellites and radars use frequencies measured in gigahertz (GHz), where 1 GHz = 1,000 MHz.

The total radio frequency spectrum is divided into various bands—from extremely low frequency (ELF) to extremely high frequency (EHF); see Figure 20-02. Various communications and navigation systems work in one or more of these bands, as indicated in the spectrum bands of Figure 20-02 and discussed below.

Figure 20-02 The radio frequency spectrum is divided into broad “bands” from extremely low frequency (ELF) to extremely high frequency (EHF). In boating, all bands from LF (differential GPS beacons) to SHF (radar) are used for various purposes. Marine radio communications are in the MF, HF, VHF, and SHF (satellite) bands.

Radio communications for boats are in the medium frequency (MF), high frequency (HF), and very high frequency (VHF) bands. The characteristics of each band are quite different, and the use of each is determined by its characteristics—primarily its operating range.

VHF The very high frequency portion of the spectrum extends from 30 to 300 MHz, but the portion of interest to boaters lies between 156 and 163 MHz. VHF radio signals are often described as “line of sight,” but actually the range is somewhat greater due to a slight degree of bending over the horizon. While the visual distance to the horizon is 1.17 , where H is the height of eye above the surface of the water in feet and distance is measured in nautical miles, an equation often used for VHF radio range calculations is 1.22 , where H is height of the antenna. (The equation for range would be 2.25  if the height were in meters, with the distance still in nautical miles.)

These equations do not yield an exact or precise determination of range, and variations can be expected. It can be seen, however, that the height of an antenna is a primary factor in determining the communications range of any particular VHF installation. The amount of power used has some effect, but it is relatively slight, much less than you might expect. Normal maximum range is usually stated as about 20 miles assuming typical antenna heights for boats, but signals may sometimes be heard at distances of 200 miles or more under unusual but not uncommon conditions. This usually occurs during temperature inversions, when a “duct” is formed between the earth’s surface and air layers at several thousand feet altitude that are warmer, rather than colder, than conditions at the surface.

MF and HF Medium frequencies (MF) lie between 300 and 3,000 kHz (3 MHz), and high frequencies (HF) between 3 and 30 MHz. Of interest to boaters is a section of MF between 2 and 3 MHz and HF frequencies in the 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 22 MHz bands. The transmission characteristics of these frequency bands vary from one to another, from day to night, and, in some cases, from summer to winter. Propagation is both by ground waves, whereby the signal follows around the surface of the earth, gradually diminishing in strength, and by sky waves, where the signal is radiated straight outward at an angle to the horizon, encounters an ionized layer in the upper atmosphere, the ionosphere, and is reflected back to earth; see Figure 20-03. These ionized layers (there are more than one) are at heights varying from 30 to 215 miles as determined by daylight/darkness conditions, season, and the status of the 11-year cycle of sunspots (radiation from the sun causes the ionization). Communications may be established over distances up to a few hundred miles by use of the ground waves, or out to thousands of miles using sky waves. There will normally be a skip zone—a dead zone between the most distant reception of ground waves and the nearest reception of sky waves.

Figure 20-03 MF and HF radio signals are transmitted both by ground waves and sky waves. Ground waves spread out along the earth’s surface for a few hundred miles. Sky waves start out at an angle above the earth’s surface, are reflected by the ionosphere, and return to earth farther out as shown above. Between the reception area for ground waves and sky waves is the “skip zone,” an area of no reception.

Selecting a frequency band for communications with a distant ship or shore station is a complex matter affected by the distance, time of day, and season. Specific instructions will be found in the operating manuals of radios used for high-seas HF communications; experience gained by use of such equipment is of great assistance in selecting the optimum frequencies. In general terms, the following guidance can be offered:

• The 2 MHz band is usable for shorter distances of 20 to 100 miles day or night, with somewhat greater distances being reached at night. FCC Rules, however, require that VHF must be used for shorter distances (about 20 miles or less), where its range is adequate.

• The 4 MHz band is a short-to-medium-distance band for 20 to 250 miles during the day but can open out to longer distances at night—150 to 1,500 miles.

• The 8 MHz band is a medium-distance (250 to 1,500 miles) band during the day and a long-distance (400 to 3,000 miles) band at night.

• The 12, 16, 22, and 25 MHz bands are for use over thousands of miles.

• The highest frequency band that can be used is normally the best choice, as signals will be stronger and atmospheric noise least.

An excellent way to determine which frequency band to use is to listen; if you can hear the distant station you want to communicate with, it will probably be able to hear you after the channel clears. If you don’t hear it on a specific frequency, try channels on higher and lower frequency bands.

Other Bands Very low frequency (VLF) and low frequency (LF) bands are used for electronic navigation systems. Frequencies in the ultrahigh frequency (UHF), super-high frequency (SHF), and extremely high frequency (EHF) bands are used for radars and satellite systems.

#### Types of Modulation

In order to be useful for voice communications, radio waves generated at a given frequency must be modulated. It is this modulation of the signal that ultimately produces audible voice emulation at the receiving end. Some radio sets modulate their transmitted signals by means of frequency modulation (FM) and some by amplitude modulation (AM).

AM Amplitude modulation, in double sideband (DSB) form, employs a carrier wave plus two sidebands, one either side of the carrier. AM is used by regular broadcast stations in the 550 to 1600 kHz band. For many years, DSB AM was also used in marine radiotelephone communications, but it has been replaced by single sideband (SSB) AM, which employs a reduced or suppressed carrier wave and only one sideband (which is all that is needed), for long-range communications.

An advantage of SSB transmission is that its “narrower” signals take up less space in a crowded spectrum and so allow more channels to be used within a given band. Another plus is that this type of modulation provides more “talk power” by concentrating all of the voice information in a single sideband (a carrier wave bears no intelligence, and the second sideband merely duplicates the first one). There is also less interference between two adjacent SSB signals than there would be with DSB transmissions.

While single sideband transceiver circuitry is necessarily more complex than AM double sideband equipment, the marine band units are outstandingly easy to operate.

FM Frequency modulation conveys information by varying the frequency of a carrier wave. The strength or amplitude of the information signal (voice) determines the amount by which the carrier frequency is altered. The frequency content of the information determines the rate at which the carrier frequency deviates from its nominal frequency.

FM radio signals have the advantage that they are not significantly affected by atmospheric noise (static) or noise from shipboard electrical equipment. FM signals are normally of excellent intelligibility and clarity with properly functioning transmitters and receivers. They also exhibit what is known as “capture effect”: When AM signals from two different stations are transmitted simultaneously on the same frequency, they interfere with one another and often render both unreadable. However, when FM signals from two transmitting stations are competing on the same channel, the stronger signal “captures” the receiver and will be heard clearly, with no interference from the weaker signal. While a VHF radio’s transmitter power will not necessarily determine communication range, a stronger signal is more likely to be heard when more than one station is transmitting on the same channel.

FM transmission displaces the transmitter signal from its nominal frequency, therefore occupying additional radio frequency “space.” Marine VHF radios use “narrow-band FM” modulation to limit the frequency deviation of the transmitter and allow for the maximum number of channels in the marine band.

#### Power

The power of a radio transmitter can be described and measured in a number of ways. VHF/FM transmitters are rated in output power, the power delivered to the point where the antenna cable is connected; this is roughly 35 to 40 percent of the DC input power from the boat’s electrical system. (The DC power consumed while receiving is very slight.) VHF sets on boats are limited by regulations to 25 watts and must have a front-panel control to reduce this to 1 watt or less. FCC rules require the use of the minimum transmitter power necessary to establish reliable communication. Use of low power reduces interference with other stations using the same frequency.

The power of single sideband radio transmitters is defined as the peak level or strength of the modulated signal (usually voice), including both the energy in the sideband that conveys the information and any residual carrier signal that may be present. The MF/HF SSB transmitters used on ships may emit signals with peak envelope power (pep) up to 1,150 watts. The transceivers sold for use on most recreational vessels deliver 100 to 150 watts PEP.

#### Antennas

While almost any piece of wire can be used to receive radio signals, the transmitting antenna must act as a precise and efficient go-between, matching the electrical characteristics (impedance) of the transmitter to the impedance of the atmosphere. The better the match, the more effective the communication link.

VHF A VHF/FM radiotelephone is virtually useless without an appropriate antenna. It can sometimes receive signals, but only relatively strong ones, and it cannot transmit. (Indeed, a radiotelephone’s circuitry can be damaged if the transmitter is triggered without an antenna being attached.)

Virtually all VHF/FM radiotelephone antennas today are of the “whip” variety—that is, they’re supported at their bottom end only. In shorter lengths (30 to about 42 inches), the whips are sometimes made of a self-supporting stainless-steel rod, but in longer lengths, they are almost always constructed of a thin wire surrounded and supported by a flexible, wrapped fiberglass-reinforced plastic casing, the casing being “transparent” to radio waves.

The basic antenna for a marine VHF radio is a vertical ½-wavelength whip, a wire about 36 inches long. Such an antenna will radiate the transmitter’s signal toward the horizon in all directions. Little or no energy is radiated upward or downward, and the energy that might have been sent in those directions is added to the strength of the signal aimed at the horizon, creating a signal at the receiving antenna that would have resulted from a transmitter having twice the power, expressed as an antenna “gain” of 3 decibels (dB). Making the antenna longer than a half wavelength redistributes the radiated energy, directing more toward the horizon at the expense of making the radiated “beam” increasingly narrow. Increased length = increased gain; a 6- to 8-foot antenna = a 6 dB gain (twice that of the 3-foot antenna); a 14- to 19-foot antenna = an 8–9 dB gain (twice as much as the 6 dB antenna, 16 times the gain of the 3 dB antenna). But is more gain better?

There are a number of reasons why installing the highest gain antenna available will produce undesirable results. First, increased gain usually requires increased length, and physical limitations may prevent installation of a very high-gain antenna. In addition, as previously noted, radiated power does not have a major effect on range; only antenna height does. Therefore, it is sometimes more effective to use a lower-gain antenna mounted high up—for instance, at the top of a sailboat mast or on a powerboat antenna extension mast.

Secondly, gain antennas work by concentrating the radiated signal: They “squeeze” increasing amounts of the radiated energy into a progressively narrowing horizontal beam and, in doing so, lose less energy to useless skyward radiation. (Remember VHF signals are not, to any useful extent, reflected back to earth by the ionosphere.) See Figure 20-04. But that horizontally concentrated pattern is an advantage only as long as the transmitting vessel remains relatively level. If the transmitting vessel heels or rolls to any great extent (for example, a sailboat under a press of sail or a powerboat running in a heavy beam sea), this horizontally concentrated pattern results in the transmitted waves being, at one moment, directed into the sea (leeward heeled side) and at the next moment beamed uselessly skyward (windward heeled side). For that reason, it is usual practice not to choose an antenna gain greater than 3 dB for sailing vessels and to limit gain to 6 to 9 dB on powerboats, depending on their size and stability.

Figure 20-04 Higher-gain antennas achieve greater range by “squeezing down” the radiation pattern (left), increasing signals at lower, desirable angles and decreasing the power that is wasted in upward, unproductive angles. An antenna with too much gain—too flat a radiation pattern—may be disadvantageous in rough water. As the boat rolls and pitches (right), the radiated signal may go above the receiving boat or down into the water. Either will cause fading and intermittent reception.

The effective radiated power of the VHF radio depends in large measure on the distance between the radio and the antenna and the energy that is absorbed in the connecting coaxial cable. Half (3 dB) of the transmitter’s power will be lost in a 49-foot length of the small-diameter (0.195-inch) RG-58U cable (6.1 dB/100 feet) used in many installations. Using ¼-inch-diameter RG-8X extends the 3 dB loss distance to 66 feet (4.5 dB/100 feet). If you use RG-213 (0.410-inch diameter) cable (2.7 dB/100 feet), the 3 dB loss occurs when the cable is 111 feet long. It is also important to use only marine-grade coaxial connectors and to use as few connectors as possible between the radio and the antenna.

If a vessel operates in open waters in rough conditions (when distress calling is most likely needed), there is always the risk of losing or seriously damaging a whip antenna. The prudent skipper carries a spare or an emergency antenna. The best is one that can be readily mounted on deck and is fitted with a cable of sufficient length and the correct coaxial connector for attachment to the vessel’s VHF radiotelephone. (This is true for sailboats, as well as powerboats, since a sailboat is most likely to have lost its mast-mounted antenna during a partial or complete dismasting.)

MF and HF Providing an efficient transmitting antenna for MF and HF transmitters poses a challenge on any boat. Unlike VHF, where a half-wavelength antenna is about 3 feet in length, a half-wavelength at 2182 KHz is 225 feet, and even the “shorter” half-wavelength at 25 MHz is more than 19 feet. Fortunately, microprocessor-controlled automatic antenna tuners (or couplers) make it possible to install an effective MF/HF antenna with little difficulty. A 17- to 23-foot vertical whip antenna connected to the antenna tuner will provide efficient and effective signal radiation over the 2–25 MHz range. Sailboats often substitute an insulated section of standing rigging for the whip antenna. The automatic antenna tuner is usually housed in a weatherproof enclosure and is mounted adjacent to the base of the antenna. A coaxial cable and a multi-wire control cable connect the tuner to the SSB radio. Each time a new operating frequency is selected, the antenna tuner automatically selects the combination of reactors (coils) and capacitors necessary to provide optimum transfer of energy to the atmosphere.

Proper operation of the MF/HF transmitter’s vertical antenna requires a radio frequency ground made by connecting the antenna tuner to seawater using a 3-inch-wide, thin copper strap (normal electrical wire will not suffice). Connecting the copper ground strap to a metal hull will create the necessary connection to the sea. In nonconductive hulls, the ground can be created by connecting the ground strap to copper screen (at least 100 square feet or 9.3 m2) adhered to the inside of the hull beneath the waterline. The copper screen, electrically insulated from the sea by the hull, will act as if it were on the exterior of the hull at the radio frequencies used for MF and HF communication.

#### Modes of Operation

Two different modes of operation are used in marine radio communications. Most marine communications are simplex—both stations transmit and receive on the same frequency. Thus the person on the receiving end cannot interrupt and communicate to the person transmitting until the latter stops transmitting and provides the opportunity. This technique is sometimes difficult for a beginner to grasp in practice—but this is the reason why you must pause after transmitting and release the microphone button. In fact, this is the only way that you will be able to hear the reply from the party at the other end.

In semi-duplex (or half-duplex) operation, two frequencies are used, each station alternately transmitting on one and receiving on the other. Full-duplex allows a station to transmit and receive simultaneously, as you would with a conventional telephone on land—this is not possible on boats, except for some satellite circuits.

### Radiotelephones

The radio communication equipment authorized for use on boats, and by persons holding no personal license or the rudimentary, easy-to-obtain Restricted Radiotelephone Operators Permit, is constructed to ensure that only certain designated frequencies are used and that it is impossible to transmit inadvertently on unauthorized frequencies. This is accomplished by eliminating the need for operator tuning, incorporating “switch-selectable” channels instead. Because the simplified operation of such units, and their primary devotion to voice communication, are reminiscent of shoreside telecommunications, the units have come to be known as radiotelephones. Such equipment must be “type accepted” by the FCC, and by regulation these are the only sets that can be used.

## THE MARINE RADIO SYSTEM

In the very early days of electronic ship-to-shore and ship-to-ship communications, the use of Morse code predominated. This continued to be the case in military and commercial marine contexts for quite some time, but no longer. Today, the vast majority of marine electronic communications, especially for recreational boats, are conducted with voice transmissions.

Marine voice transmissions are, for the most part, much like conversations between two persons over shoreside telephones. However, there are at least two important differences between ordinary onshore telephone conversations and marine communications.

Except for some VHF use, there are very specific federal licensing requirements and more stringent procedural regulations for marine communications. It should be noted that communications regulations and certain procedures vary from one country to another. Unless otherwise stated, the material in this chapter should be understood as pertaining exclusively to the United States. The rules and regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) uniformly refer to “ship stations”—boaters must understand that this applies to vessels of all sizes, even the smallest of boats.

### Safety Communications

Perhaps the most important point for skippers of recreational craft to understand is that, by law, the primary function of regulated electronic communications at sea is safety, and that marine radio communications related to safety have absolute priority over all other communications. Certain other specified uses of marine radios are allowed, but the overriding rule is that if you’re talking to another vessel or to a shore station about matters other than immediate safety—for example, the weather, or whether a destination marina has a slip available for your arrival—you must without exception cease transmitting if there is a safety-related communication competing for the airwaves. In fact, even among safety-related communications there is a specific hierarchy of priority that must, again under law, be observed. These points will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

### Operational Communications

In addition to safety, electronic voice communications are also allowed for “operational” purposes, which, strictly speaking, are those having to do with the navigation, movement, and management of vessels at sea. In the recreational sector, these categories of operational uses are, for the most part, interpreted liberally. For example, ship-to-ship communications between two boats about where to stay for the night would be considered as having to do with “movement.” And ship-to-shore communications between a yacht skipper and the attendant at a fuel dock would be considered as having to do with “management.” However, a call to a marina to make dinner reservations at that facility’s restaurant would not fall within this category and so would not be permissible.

### Personal & Social Communications

It’s important to keep in mind that, however liberally the concepts of “safety” and “operational” are interpreted, the laws governing marine communications strictly prohibit superfluous personal or social chitchat between boats on most channels (frequencies).

Communications of a strictly personal or social nature are allowed, but only in certain contexts and on certain channels specifically designed for that purpose. These circumstances and channels have primarily to do with ship-to-shore communications, in which a radio connection is made with a land-based telephone system via a marine operator (if one is available). In such cases, the boat’s radiotelephone becomes part of the land-based telephone system; calls may be placed to, or received from, shoreside telephones for any purpose allowed under the laws governing land-based telecommunications. Keep in mind, however, that calls placed through a marine operator are subject to “linkage” and other charges.

Marine VHF radio rules do not apply to cellular telephone communications from vessels or to such services as citizen band (CB) and the Family Radio Service (FRS).

##### “RESCUE 21”

The Coast Guard’s legacy National Distress and Response System has been replaced by RESCUE 21, an entirely new and vastly more capable communication network. Based on the use of Digital Selective Calling (DSC), the new system provides VHF radio communication out to at least 20 nautical miles from shore along the entire coastline of the continental U.S. and extensive coverage elsewhere. As of 2017 the system covers 41,871 miles of coastline including the Great Lakes, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, with Alaska due by the end of 2017.

Rescue 21 uses the latest communication technology, including DSC and computer-enhanced direction finding (±2° line of bearing) to take much of the “search” out of search and rescue. DSC calls that include the vessel’s GPS position instantly provide the Coast Guard with a wealth of life-saving information. The precise position of the calling vessel is immediately plotted on the system’s computer screen chart. Relevant information about the calling vessel is immediately available through reference to the vessel’s MMSI (see this page), as is the “nature of distress” information that can be included in the distress call from some sets. The Coast Guard’s DSC distress signal acknowledgment call automatically terminates the calling radio’s continuing transmission of the DSC distress call and switches the calling radio to Channel 16 to ensure that the operator of the radio will hear the ensuing voice calls from the Rescue 21 site that is managing the distress call.

Multiple communication channels at each Rescue 21 antenna site enable the Coast Guard to manage communications with multiple stations: Coast Guard vessels and aircraft and components of local emergency services and law enforcement. Encryption is available to provide communication security for sensitive traffic.

The use of DSC hailing in which a digital signal transmitted on Channel 70 (which is reserved exclusively for the brief, one-third-of-a-second signal) for distress signaling benefits everyone. The digital hailing signal can be received and accurately decoded even when conditions make it difficult or impossible to establish clear voice communication. The DSC hailing call cannot be blocked by traffic on Channel 16 that all too often interferes with voice calls for assistance. The DSC hailing call provides the Coast Guard with a great deal of very useful information.

The Rescue 21 System’s instantaneous radio direction-finding system protects against the serious, potentially fatal result of hoax distress calls that can divert search-and-rescue assets at times when they are needed to respond to an actual emergency. All received calls are automatically logged, including their position as determined by the intersecting lines of bearing from all of the sites at which the signal was received. A hoax caller is very likely to be responding to a visit from the Coast Guard or from local law enforcement within minutes of making the illegal call.

### Licensing

The regulations of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) do not require individual station licenses for VHF/FM radios on “voluntarily equipped” boats that do not travel to foreign ports or engage in international communications; included in this exemption are radars and all types of EPIRBs (emergency position-indicating radiobeacons; see this page). Cruising or fishing in international waters—beyond the 12-mile U.S. territorial limit—does not invoke the requirement for a station license provided that you not enter waters under the jurisdiction of another country. This action benefits a large majority of U.S. boaters in that a fee no longer must be paid. Even though an individual license is not required, such a station must still be used in full compliance with all applicable operating regulations as before; the only exception is that now call signs will not be used, as they will no longer be assigned.

Note carefully that this change in FCC rules does not exempt any craft required by law or regulation to be equipped with a radio. Also not exempted are HF-MF single-sideband (SSB) installations and radio-equipped boats that do travel to foreign waters or communicate across national boundaries; these must have licenses as before. No station license is required for U.S. recreational craft in Canadian waters.

Before applying for any FCC license or permit, a person must obtain an FCC registration number (FRN). This can be done electronically at http://www.fcc.gov (click on button for “Licensing and Databases” and then click on “CORES”) or by submitting a paper Form 160 to FCC Attn: CORES Administrator, 445 12th Street SW, Washington, DC 20554-0001. There is no fee. Changes are made by filing Form 161 online or by mail. If you forget your FRN, go to the search function on the FCC home page. Your business name and FRN should appear in the search results. If you need more help, call the FRN help desk at 877-480-3201, option 4.

#### Applying for a Station License

A station license may be issued to a U.S. citizen, corporation, or an alien individual, but not to the government of a foreign nation or its representative. This license can be applied for by mail using FCC Form 605—provided you have your state registration numbers or a U.S. Coast Guard documentation number. (Note: The FCC will accept only the current form; forms packed with radios by the manufacturer may be obsolete. Forms may be requested by calling 888-225-5322, or they may be downloaded from the Internet at www.fcc.gov/forms.) Form 605 is a multipart form; detailed instructions for completion of the application appear on the first nine pages. Read and heed these carefully to avoid having your application returned for correction or additional information. The next two pages are the application that will be mailed to the FCC. Be sure that you ask for all the frequency bands you need now or can anticipate needing in the future.

Fees for the ship station and operator permit total $220 as of 2017 and must accompany the application together with FCC Form 159 marked with payment code “PASR.” Payment may be made by check or money order, payable to “FCC,” or by credit card (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, or Discover Card). Send all required papers to Federal Communications Commission, P.O. Box 979097, St. Louis, MO, 63197-9000. Fees are reviewed annually and may be changed. Application can be made electronically with payment by credit card. If the application is returned as defective, the returned papers may require a second application fee payment. Questions regarding fees can be directed to 202-418-3676, 800-418-3676, or 877-480-3201, option 2.

If you need immediate use of the radio, Schedule F at the end of Form 605 becomes a temporary license valid for 90 days, within which time you should receive the formal papers. It gives information on generating a temporary call sign (based on your registration or documentation numbers) that can be used for interim operation. Use of such a temporary call sign must cease on receipt of the regular license and call sign, even if the 90-day period has not expired.

Radio station licenses in the U.S. are issued in the name of the owner and the vessel. A station license is not automatically transferred to another person upon sale of the boat, nor may a license be moved with the radio set to a new boat owned by the same person; a new license must be applied for using Forms 605 and 159 marked with fee payment code “PASR,” plus payment in the same amount as for a new license. A change in the licensee’s legal name, mailing address, vessel name, official documentation number, or state registration number (but not a change in ownership) does not require license modification, just send Form 605 for an “Administrative Update”—no fee required—to the FCC at 1270 Fairfield Rd., Gettysburg, PA 17325-7245, advising of the change. A copy of this form must be posted on board along with the license. A simple change in equipment requires no action at all. The only instance of a modification of a license during its term would be to add an FCC-issued Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) number; see this page. The FCC does not charge a fee for this. (An MMSI may be obtained without charge from BoatU.S., Sea Tow, and several other authorized sources.) The license expiration date is not changed. A license may be modified at the time of renewal without additional cost beyond the normal renewal fee. If a station license is lost, a duplicate must be obtained; send Forms 605 and 159 and the fee of $70 using fee payment code “PADM.”

FCC regulations require that a station license be conspicuously posted on board the vessel at the principal control point of the station. The license term is 10 years. Approximately 120 days before the expiration date, the FCC will send a renewal reminder. If this is not received by 30 days before expiration, renewal should be Form 605 and Form 159 marked with the fee payment code “PASR,” together with the same fee as for a new license, to the FCC Wireless Bureau Applications, P.O. Box 979097, St. Louis, MO, 63197-9000. Licenses can also be renewed on the Internet with payment by credit card. If you did make timely application for renewal, operation may continue even if you have not received the renewed license before the expiration date. If the boat is sold or use of the radio station is ever permanently discontinued, you should send Form 605 requesting cancellation of the license to the FCC at the Gettysburg address; this will preclude your being held responsible for any future misuse of the call sign concerned.

#### Applying for an Operator Permit

A personal license, a radio operator permit, is not required for the operation of a VHF set on a boat exempt from having to have a station license as described above. An exception applies if a boat goes into Canadian waters: an operator permit is required (Canada has a station license exemption similar to the United States, but requires an operator permit for its boaters). If such license is required, a Restricted Radiotelephone Operator Permit or higher grade of license is required.

For vessels carrying more than six passengers for hire, and for vessels over 65 feet in length on the Great Lakes, whether commercial or noncommercial, the operator must have a higher-grade Marine Radio Operator Permit. At least a restricted permit is required on board vessels that must comply with the Bridge-to-Bridge Radiotelephone Act (see Chapter 5)—vessels over 65 feet in length, tugs over 26 feet, and dredges in channels. A higher-class license is available for trained individuals making tuning adjustments and repairs. In situations where a licensed operator is required, an unlicensed person may talk into the microphone, but a licensed operator must be present and responsible for the proper use of the station.

An applicant for any grade of U.S. operator’s license must be a U.S. citizen or a foreign national eligible for work in the U.S. (there are some exceptions for special cases). For a Restricted Radiotelephone Operator Permit, you do not have to appear in person at any FCC office. It is obtained by filling out FCC Form 605 and mailing it to the Federal Communications Commission, Wireless Bureau Applications, P.O. Box 979097, St. Louis, MO, 63197-9000. A fee of $70 must accompany the application and Form 159 marked with payment type code “PARR.” The permit is issued, without test or examination, by declaration. The applicant must “certify” that he can speak and hear, keep at least a rough written log, and is familiar with the treaties, laws, and regulations governing the station he will operate. He must also certify that he had need for a permit because he intends to engage in international voyages and is eligible for employment in the United States. The restricted permit is valid for the lifetime of the person to whom it is issued, unless it is suspended or revoked. Follow the instructions carefully to avoid having the application returned to you for correction. A portion of Form 605 may be retained as a temporary operator permit, valid for 60 days; this allows you to get on the air immediately if your operations require a permit.

An examination is required for the higher-grade Marine Radio Operator Permit, necessitating a visit to an authorized examination office; these are listed on the Internet at http://wireless.fcc.gov/commoperators/index.htm. This test is nontechnical, in a multiple-choice format, and consists of the basic radio law and operating practice questions with which a radio operator should be familiar. To pass, the examinee must correctly answer at least 18 of the 24 questions. You will find the examination not at all difficult if you prepare for it properly; study pamphlets are available. The examination centers charge a fee, which varies, for conducting the examination. The FCC does not charge a fee for this permit, which is issued for the holder’s lifetime.

If your radio operator permit is lost or becomes illegible, apply immediately for a duplicate. Use the same form as for an original and a fee of $70 with Form 159 marked PADM. State the circumstances fully and, if the license has been lost, you must certify that a reasonable search has been made. Continued operation is authorized if a signed copy of the application for a duplicate is posted. If a lost license is found later, send either that license or the duplicate to the FCC for cancellation.

• Canadian licensing Canadian boats are subject to similar station and operator licensing; the only significant difference is that the Canadian Restricted Operator Certificate (Maritime) requires passing a brief exam on correct operating procedures. This exam is only given by units of the Canadian Power & Sail Squadrons. The certificate is available without charge, but must be obtained before applying for a Noncompulsory Station License. Such a station license is required only for those vessels sailing to waters other than those of Canada; since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, such station license is required for Canadian craft in U.S. waters.

Information on current licensing procedures and the appropriate forms can be obtained from Canadian Power & Sail Squadrons, (CPS-ECP), 26 Golden Gate Court, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M1P 3A5; telephone 888-277-2628; www.cps-ecp.ca.

## VHF/FM RADIO SERVICE

For small craft, the maritime communications system is divided into two parts—short range and long range. Each of these portions involves different equipment—VHF/FM for short range, and MF-HF/SSB for long range.

Most marine electronic voice communications, especially in the recreational sector, use a VHF/FM radiotelephone. In fact, by law, a VHF/FM radio must be installed on board as a precondition to the licensing and installation of any other form of marine radiotelephone. The reason for this is that VHF/FM is, by domestic law and international treaty, the prescribed vehicle for local communications, both ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore.

### Channels

The marine VHF communications band stretches from 156 to 162.5 MHz. Within this band, there are numbered channels spaced 25 kHz apart. Actual frequencies are rarely mentioned in marine communications; the general procedure is to speak of channel numbers. Channels, or groups of channels, are assigned specific uses and may not be used for other purposes; see Table 20-1. Most are simplex channels; others are semiduplex. In the United States, some channels internationally assigned for duplex use are employed for simplex communications on the lower frequency of the pair; these have the letter “A” as a suffix, such as 22A. VHF transceivers have a USA/International switch to select the appropriate channels. Remember “A” (“Alfa”) in “USA” when communicating with the U.S. Coast Guard.

Table 20-1 This table lists selected VHF channels, their operating frequencies, and their general purposes, focusing primarily on the interests of recreational (noncommercial) boaters. Some additional commercial and noncommercial channels are available in specific limited areas. The FCC has numerous additional conditions and limitations on certain channels too complex to be shown here. The “A” suffix indicates a channel used only in U.S. waters and is different from its frequencies and purpose in international usage. Wx1, Wx2, and Wx3 are widely used as the primary channels for continuous weather reports and forecasts. Additional Channels Wx4 – Wx7 are used in specific areas, as necessary, to avoid possible interference with a primary channel. Channels 87B & 88B are AIS channels (see this page).

VHF/FM transmissions are basically line of sight—that is, the signals are not reflected by the ionosphere under normal conditions, nor do they significantly bend around the curvature of the earth. Consequently, VHF/FM transmission is fairly well restricted to a limited geographical area, on average 10 to 15 nautical miles in ship-to-ship situations and 25 to 30 miles ship-to-shore, depending on the heights of both the transmitting and receiving antennas. That means a boat transmitting in, say, Jacksonville, Florida, on 156.3 MHz will not interfere with one transmitting on the same frequency at the exact same time in St. Augustine, Florida, 45 miles away. And the potential for interference is further decreased in VHF/FM radiotelephones by the legal limitation of their maximum output power to 25 watts, the requirement for a switch-selectable, 1-watt output for close-in communications, and by the capture effect previously mentioned.

### Equipment Selection

There are many manufacturers of VHF radio equipment for boats and ships—and each manufacturer has many models. The selection of a VHF set for your boat should be undertaken with study and care. As with most electronic devices, a higher price brings better construction and more features, but you may not need the very top-of-the-line transceiver. Compare models and ask other boaters what has been their experience with different manufacturers and models; see Figure 20-05.

Figure 20-05 A VHF transceiver must be “type accepted” by the FCC. Power is switch-selectable between 25 watts and 1 watt. Low power should be used for short distances to reduce interference to other stations and is mandatory (automatic) for Channel 13.

#### Power & Channels

VHF/FM radiotelephones are limited by law to 25 watts output power and required to have a 1-watt switchable low-power setting. Output power does not directly determine operating range, which can be considered as line-of-sight between the transmitting and receiving antennas regardless of transmitting or radiating power. However, output power does have a bearing on capture effect, namely, the ability of the signal to be received clearly in spite of potential interference from simultaneous signals from other transmitters. As a practical matter, every VHF/FM set now manufactured, except handheld models, is built with the maximum allowable 25 watts output power. Handheld units will usually have an output power of 5 watts, sometimes less.

VHF radios—full-size and handheld—have the legally required channels and many more.

#### Receiver Specifications

The performance of the receiver is as important as that of the radio’s transmitter and accounts for about 75% of the cost of the radio. The most significant measure of receiver performance is its ability to ensure that you hear what you need to hear and reject the interfering signals. It’s easy to build a sufficiently sensitive receiver (typically 0.25µV); it is more difficult and costly to provide the levels of selectivity, intermodulation rejection ratio, and spurious response rejection ratio that are required to deal with today’s noisy signal conditions, especially in the major metropolitan areas. A radio that achieves a rating of at least 60 dB for each of these measures will be satisfactory when used in relatively unpopulated and therefore “quiet” areas. Radios used in major ports and near large cities should measure at least 70 dB for these parameters. To obtain the best performance, choose a set whose receiver measures 80 dB for intermodulation rejection ratio.

#### Other Considerations & Features

Beyond channel capability, sensitivity, and selectivity, there are other features of potential interest, the inclusion of which directly affect a unit’s price. One factor is water-resistance. Some units are more “splash-proof” than others, and thus more suitable for exposed locations; some are even rated as waterproof—submersible to a limited depth for a limited time.

Nearly all sets are capable of scanning in various modes: all channels or only selected channels. Also common is a button that allows instant, direct access to Channel 16, or 16 and 9.

Most units incorporate an automatic “dual watch” and/or scanning feature that allows you to monitor Channel 16 (as required whenever your boat is underway) plus one or more other channels on which you might be expecting to receive a call. Some sets also have “tri-watch” so that Channels 16 and 9 plus a selected channel can be concurrently monitored.

Backlit, adjustable-brightness LCDs display the radio’s operational status: U.S. or International (and sometimes also Canadian) Channel selection; high/low power; channel in use. If connected to a GPS receiver, the LCD may display latitude and longitude and may provide additional navigation information, including SOG, COG, date, and time. Some sets are available with wired or wireless microphones that include channel selection controls; others provide full remote control of all functions.

Most installed VHF receivers have the capability of feeding a remotely located auxiliary speaker so that a watch can be kept below decks; some can be used as a loud hailer and automatic foghorn.

All VHF radios can monitor NOAA VHF Weather Radio broadcasts. A weather alert function in some sets will sound a distinctive audio alert tone on receipt of a hazardous weather alert. Some can be programmed to respond only to those alerts that apply to the vessel’s position.

#### Digital Selective Calling

Digital selective calling (DSC) is a hailing system designed to improve the way in which communication is established between stations communicating in the MF, HF, and VHF marine bands. DSC is an important component of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS); see this page. The use of DSC hailing eliminates the need to hail another station by voice call and includes the ability to transmit certain messages, including Mayday calls, automatically. The mandatory listening watch on the voice-hailing channels such as VHF 16 is unchanged.

DSC uses a digital transmission to send a specific set of data, including the caller’s MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity), a nine-digit number that identifies the vessel; the requested working frequency; priority of the call; and other data. DSC calls can be made to an individual ship or shore station; a group of stations, such as a fleet of boats cruising together; a specific set of stations, such as all USCG units; or all receivers within range, such as for distress calls or if the called station’s MMSI is not known. The called station automatically responds with a DSC signal, after which voice contact is made on Channel 16 if it is a distress situation, or on a designated working channel if it is not. A DSC-equipped vessel or shore station can make a hailing call on Channel 70 to establish contact with automatic switching to a working channel without calling on Channel 16. The MMSI is assigned by FCC on the station license. Boats not required to have a license can get one from BoatU.S., Sea Tow, the U.S. Power Squadrons, or Shine Micro. It is very important that the registration data be kept up to date—report all changes immediately as they occur.

DSC distress calls can include the vessel’s location, either directly transferred from a GPS receiver or entered manually. Calls can indicate the specific nature of the distress, such as “sinking,” “on fire,” etc.

DSC Types There are various classes of DSC radios. In the U.S., boats may use a VHF radio with SC-101 capabilities; such sets are capable of sending and receiving distress, safety, and routine calls using DSC. SC-101 radios have only one receiver and cannot monitor Channel 70 when the set is transmitting or receiving on another channel. The better, Class D radios have a second receiver that continuously monitors Channel 70 for DSC calls even when the primary radio is receiving (not transmitting) on another channel; see Figure 20-06. Class A DSC radios include a second receiver for Channel 70 that is active even when the set is transmitting on another frequency. Additional features include calling number memory and a keypad similar to that found on conventional telephones; this simplifies the entry of the MMSI number of a station that you wish to call.

Figure 20-06 VHF transceivers must now have at least a minimal capability of Digital Selective Calling (DSC). Sets with a numeric keypad are advantageous for entering the nine-digit MMSI (Maritime Mobile Service Identity) number for the station or stations you wish to call. Many sets will have memory storage for frequently used MMSIs. This one has AIS, too.

VHF radios that do not have DSC capability may continue to be used; however, the very significant safety and routine communication advantages provided by the DSC system are more than sufficient to warrant consideration of installing a DSC-capable set. Both the Class D, dual-receiver models and the less-capable single-receiver (SC-101) radios will provide full interaction with the Coast Guard’s Rescue 21 system.

In any event, a wise skipper will compare the latest specifications and features of a number of units in a given price range before making a final selection of VHF/FM radiotelephone equipment.

#### Handheld Units

In recent years, small portable (as opposed to full-size installed) VHF/FM radios have gained significantly in popularity. Generally referred to as handheld units, this type is fitted with an integral microphone, speaker, and antenna, as well as a rechargeable battery; see Figure 20-07. Advances in rechargeable battery technology, including the universal use of nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) and lithium-ion (Li-on) have greatly benefited handheld radios, extending operating time before recharging to as much as 20 hours (5% transmitting, 5% receiving audio, 90% receiver standby). Maximum transmit power output ranges from 3 to 6 watts, plus the mandatory 1-watt low power setting. Most radios are supplied complete with both 120-volt AC and 12-volt DC battery chargers. AA or AAA alkaline cells can be used in many radios if the rechargeable battery is depleted.

Figure 20-07 Small handheld VHF transceivers now have essentially all the features of a full-size installed set, except for output power. These include coverage of all channels, dual-watch, scanning in one or more modes, one-button switching to Channel 16 (and on some sets to 16 and 9), and other features such as Weather Alert, DSC, and integrated GPS.

Most handheld radios provide a means for connecting an external microphone/earphone. Bluetooth wireless headsets can be used with some models. The radio’s short “rubber duck” antenna is attached using a coaxial connector and can be removed to allow an adapter to be used, allowing the radio to connect to a fixed-mount antenna that will significantly increase the strength of the radiated signal. The degree to which a radio will withstand exposure to the marine environment ranges from JIS4, splashproof, to JIS7, submersible to a depth of 1 meter for 30 minutes, or IPX8, continuous immersion.

Many of the operating modes and features available in fixed-mount VHF radios, such as multichannel scanning and weather alert, are included in handheld radios. A few models have a digital selective calling capability with the SC-101 specification (one receiver only). Some DSC handheld radios obtain GPS position information via a connection in the radio’s charging cradle; others have an integral GPS receiver. Some models can operate on FRS (see this page) channels and receive AM and FM broadcasts.

A handheld unit can be valuable as follows:

• For communication between a dinghy or tender and the vessel that it accompanies.

• As a backup for the regular radiotelephone.

• On larger vessels, where it is sometimes useful to have a radio capability when away from the regular installation.

• For two-way emergency communication in the event of having to abandon ship.

Remember that it is not legal to use a VHF handheld radio to communicate with the vessel’s main radio from a position on board that vessel. In other words, you cannot legally use a marine radio for intercom purposes. There are, however, FRS radios (see this page) with headsets that can be used to talk between two locations on board. These are full-duplex units without push-to-talk buttons.

Handhelds also have other limitations. They have limited output power. Their integral antennas are much shorter and less efficient, and are, naturally, situated no higher than the hand that holds the unit. These factors combine to make handhelds unsuitable for anything more than relatively close-in communications. And so, while they definitely have their place, they are rarely, if ever, an adequate substitute for full-power, fully featured installed sets.

Contrary to all-too-common practice, handheld VHF/FM marine radiotelephones are not authorized as walk-around, portable units. Except for licensed stationary shore stations, mobile marine radio is authorized only for shipboard use (which includes yachts and tenders). Using a handheld from an onshore location—for example, to call your vessel from a shoreside shop—is a violation of the marine radiotelephone regulations.

### Installation & Maintenance

Most of today’s fixed-mount VHF/FM radiotelephones come from the factory fully tested and ready to operate, requiring only connection to a power source and an appropriate antenna. Installation does not necessarily require the services of a trained technician.

If you choose to install one of these units yourself, it’s important to keep a few points in mind. When hooking the radio up to the vessel’s DC electrical system, be certain that correct polarity is observed and that an appropriate in-line fuse is used. (Refer to Chapter 19 and the radiotelephone manufacturer’s installation instructions.) Mount the unit in as protected a location as possible, consistent with convenient use for both receiving and transmitting; because the speaker contains a powerful magnet, it should not be placed close to a compass. As some heat is generated from the operation of the set, allow for adequate ventilation around the case. When mounting the unit, remember that it’s necessary to run not only power to it, but the antenna cable as well. Never attempt to splice coaxial cable, but instead employ, when necessary, appropriate cable connectors (PL-259 with appropriate reducer for smaller cables, see this page), which are available at any marine electronics dealer. And avoid sharp bends in the antenna cable by employing, if necessary, a right-angle cable connector like the Shakespeare 259-239-G. Make sure that all coaxial cable connections are correctly made; use properly soldered connectors, which are much more reliable in a marine environment than so-called solderless connectors. Finally, be sure to ground the radio case according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Although a radio frequency (RF) ground is not necessary for the operation of a VHF/FM radiotelephone, it will help eliminate interference from adjacent electronic equipment.

Once a VHF/FM radiotelephone is installed, there is very little maintenance that can be performed by any operator who is not also a trained radio technician; fortunately, very little is needed. It’s wise to inspect the antenna and power line connections periodically for signs of resistance-inducing corrosion. And the same is true for the ferrules of in-line fuses. Any corrosion should be removed, and any soldered connections redone if broken or deteriorated.

FCC regulations (47CFR Ch. 1 [10-1-03 Edition §80.310]) require that any vessel equipped with a marine VHF radio maintain a listening watch on Channel 16 and, if DSC-equipped, on Channel 70 whenever the vessel is underway and the radio is not being used to communicate. The receive-mode power drain of the radio is minimal—typically less than 1 ampere. Recreational vessels may alternatively maintain a watch on Channel 9 for call and reply purposes. The loudspeaker need not be on when maintaining a DSC watch.

A fixed-mount VHF radio that is used regularly requires no special maintenance other than occasional cleaning with fresh water and inspection for deterioration of the microphone cable and for signs of corrosion on the antenna and power connections.

Be sure to follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding initial charging of the battery in a handheld radio. Many handhelds have removable antennas with BNC connectors; these can be connected to an installed antenna by use of an adapter (e.g., Radio Shack No. 278-120).

### Operating Rules & Procedures

A vessel equipped with a marine VHF radio may use any means at its disposal to attract attention, make known its position, and obtain help. A distress call and message, however, must be transmitted only on the authority of the master or person responsible for the mobile station. No person shall knowingly transmit or cause to be transmitted any false or fraudulent signal of distress or related communication. If the person responsible for the station is incapacitated and a life-threatening situation exists, anyone may make a distress call. A distress call has absolute priority over all other transmissions.

#### Establishing Contact

Calls not related to distress or safety may be initiated on Channel 16, but such transmissions must be limited to establishing contact and determining a working channel (see below) to be used. Any single calling transmission must not exceed 30 seconds’ duration, and if no reply is received, a 2-minute pause must be observed before repeating the call. A maximum of three call attempts, separated by 2-minute silences, may be made before a 15-minute silence must be observed (this silence may be reduced to 3 minutes if the call transmissions will not interfere with traffic from other stations). No transmissions on Channel 16 may exceed 1 minute. These limitations do not apply to emergency situations. Nonemergency transmissions on Channel 16 are absolutely limited to reaching agreement on the working channel to be used; not even the briefest messages are to be transmitted.

In order to lessen congestion on Channel 16, which has been steadily increasing, the FCC has authorized the voluntary use of Channel 9 by noncommercial vessels for initial calls. You are cautioned, however, that maintaining a watch for calls on Channel 9 does not relieve you of the legal requirement for maintaining a watch on Channel 16. Listening on that channel is necessary to hear warnings and announcements from the Coast Guard as well as distress calls from other vessels. Remember, Channel 16 is the only channel to be used for distress traffic. If you have a set with the dual-watch or tri-watch feature, it will be possible for you to simultaneously monitor both Channels 16 and 9.

Use of digital selective calling to initiate communication with another vessel is highly recommended.

#### After Contact Has Been Made

Once contact is established on an appropriate working channel (see below), the ensuing exchange of transmission must be:

• Of a legally permissible nature

• Of the minimum possible duration

The phonetic alphabet (see this page) should be used to spell call signs, names, places, etc., only when absolutely necessary to ensure clarity. In most circumstances, when reception is clear, use of phonetics, while it sounds “professional” to some, only prolongs exchanges unnecessarily.

Further, superfluous words and phrases, such as “Do you read me?” and “Come in, Bluejay” should be avoided as much as possible in order to shorten transmission times. And to avoid unnecessary interference with other transmissions on the same frequency, the minimum practical transmitting power setting must, by law, be used—1 watt will suffice more often than you might think.

#### Station Identification

Licensed stations with call signs must identify themselves at the start and end of an exchange of transmissions; it is not necessary to again state the call sign upon shifting to a working channel. Boats now without call signs must also identify themselves, but do so routinely by stating the vessel’s name.

#### The Privacy of Communications

The Communications Act of 1934 as subsequently amended and the radio operating rules issued by the FCC forbid any person from divulging, except to the intended addressee or his authorized agent, any information gained from receiving or intercepting any radio transmissions not addressed to him, and from using to his own benefit any such information. This does not apply to distress communications or to public broadcasts, but it does apply to all other conversations.

### Priority Channels

The most important frequency on the VHF radiotelephone band is Channel 16 (156.8 MHz), the international distress, safety, and calling frequency. It is on Channel 16 that all Mayday, Pan-Pan (pronounced “pahn-pahn”) and Securite (pronounced “saycuritay”) calls are made (refer to Chapter 12).

Mayday calls are absolute first-priority distress calls involving imminent danger of loss of life or vessel. Pan-Pan calls are second-priority urgent communications concerning the safety of a ship, aircraft, other vessel, or person in sight or on board. Securite calls are third-priority safety messages concerning navigation or weather. When a transmission is preceded by one of these priority call identifiers, other operators must stay clear of the channel (even if that means cutting short a communication in progress) until it is clear that the priority call has been concluded.

It’s important to understand and use these priority signal identifiers correctly, as misuse, especially of the Mayday signal, can cause dangerous confusion and expensive false alarms. For example, while running aground on a falling tide in a calm sea a short distance from shore may be inconvenient, it does not generally warrant a Mayday call. If, in such a case, your stranded vessel would be a hazard to navigation, say in a heavy fog, such a situation might warrant a Securite call, but probably just a normal call to the Coast Guard to ask them to switch to their working channel, then advising them of your situation and location, would be more in order. The same is true if you have simply run out of fuel, or if your engine has died or won’t start.

Channel 16, the international hailing channel, may be used to establish initial contact with another vessel in international and US waters. Calls for a “radio check” to an undesignated vessel or shore station are prohibited on Channel 16. However, DSC hailing to a known MMSI totally eliminates congestion on Channel 16 (the digital hailing signal is sent on Channel 70) and provides greater assurance that the hailed vessel will recognize the arrival of the incoming call, since an alert tone will be heard even if the speaker volume is at a low or off setting. A DSC “All Ships” hailing call is a very effective method for establishing communication with ships on the high seas.

#### Mayday Calls

Transmit a DSC Mayday call if so equipped, followed immediately by a voice Mayday call on Channel 16 (refer to this page). The DSC call will repeat automatically until acknowledged by the Coast Guard. If there is no response to your voice calls, make a Mayday call on any channel on which you have heard other traffic.

If your DSC Mayday call is received by the Coast Guard, their acknowledgement signal will terminate the ongoing automatic repetition of your radio’s DSC Mayday call and switch your radio to Channel 16 in preparation for Coast Guard–initiated voice communication. Your DSC call will have provided the Coast Guard with your vessel’s MMSI and, assuming the radio is properly connected to a GPS receiver, your precise position; however, they may ask you to verify the position and for additional information useful in their effort to provide the assistance you require. Respond clearly and as calmly as possible to all questions, and follow their directions.

If it becomes necessary to abandon ship, inform the Coast Guard of your planned action and take your handheld radio with you, turned on and tuned to Channel 16. The Rescue 21 system is designed to be able to communicate with a handheld radio transmitting on the 1-watt power setting at distances up to 20 nautical miles.

##### IN THE BEGINNING…

When VHF radios first became available for recreational boats, a pair of crystals—one for each receiving and one for each transmitting frequency—were required (except a single crystal for simplex channels). Space was limited, so most sets had provisions for only 12 channels, and some were limited to just six. Crystals were relatively expensive, and to keep the cost of the sets down, not all channels were activated (even so, the costs were several times what they are today). For boat-to-boat communications, there were all the present channels, plus Channel 70—few if any craft were sold set up to talk on all 12 channels. To make contacts between skippers more practical, manufacturers decided that all sets would have at least one common channel for intership contacts, and that this would be Channel 68. The habit of saying “Switch to 68” persists today—even among many boaters, recreational and commercial, who don’t know how it started. There’s nothing magic about 68; there is much to be gained by using 69, 71, 72, or 78A—clearer, less busy channels. So the next time you need to shift off of 16, try using one of the other channels.

### Working Channels

VHF/FM radio operations are much facilitated by having enough channels to assign separate ones for the different types of communications, and even for various types of vessels. The success of the VHF marine radio service depends upon the use of the correct channel for the specific type of communications and vessels involved.

Features of the VHF service are the assignment of different channels to commercial and noncommercial vessels for operational communication, and the limited range of VHF, which excludes interference from stations 30 to 50 miles or more away. Noncommercial craft are assigned five exclusive channels for intership traffic (plus additional ones in specific limited geographic areas); commercial vessels have 12 other channels of their own. The most used intership noncommercial channel is 68; it is greatly overused in preference to other available channels; see the sidebar, “In the Beginning…” and refer to Table 20-1. Channel 9 (also called 09) can be used by both noncommercial and commercial vessels. Channel 13, Navigation Safety (also known as the bridge-to-bridge channel) is available for all ships.

Ship-shore communications to a marine operator (in FCC terms, a public coast station) are possible on a number of channels. Each station is assigned one or more of the channels shown on this page. (There are very few of these stations left in service as a result of the wide popularity of cell phones.)

Ship-to-shore radio contacts are also possible on VHF with yacht clubs, marinas, and similar private coast stations, as they are designated in the FCC Rules; these use other channels such as 9, 68, 69, 71, or 78A.

Channel 22 (properly called 22 Alpha and designated 22A) is the Coast Guard Liaison and Maritime Safety channel and is used by them to announce urgent marine information and storm warnings and for non-emergency communication with the Coast Guard.

Channel 13 (67 in some areas) is restricted to “bridge-to-bridge” communications. The term “bridge” originally meant only the control station of a vessel, and the channel was used for directing the safe passage of vessels past one another. More recently, this channel has been authorized for use for communications with the operating personnel of drawbridges to request and acknowledge openings (see Chapter 5, this page). Large vessels, tugs, and dredges in channels must guard (maintain a listening watch on) this in addition to Channel 16. It is used with abbreviated operating procedures to ensure navigational safety while maneuvering in close quarters. It must not be used for any other purpose, and power is limited to 1 watt. It is not required for recreational craft, but may often be of use, especially where drawbridges are radio equipped.

Under limited conditions, aircraft are authorized to use Channels 6 and 16; 9, 68, and 72; and 8, 18, and 67 for communications with ships and boats.

Channel 70 is reserved for transmission of Digital Selective Calling (DSC) distress and hailing calls. The brief digital hailing message identifies the type of call being made, the station making the call, and—for individual or group calls—the Maritime Mobile Service Identity (MMSI) of the station being called. Distress calls and “All Station” calls will be received by, and alert, the operators of all DSC radios in range of the transmitting radio. The digital, error-corrected DSC signal is more likely to be received in adverse reception conditions than a voice call. A DSC hailing to an individual station or group of stations will sound an alert on the station(s) called, is more efficient and effective than voice hailing, and removes traffic from Channel 16, the primary voice channel for distress communication. DSC hailing channels are also assigned in the MF and HF bands.

Channel assignments in Canada are generally the same as those used in the U.S., with the exception of channels normally reserved for use only by commercial vessels. Weather broadcast channel assignments are identical, although use varies by region. Most radios provide three channel assignment menus: U/C/I for U.S., Canadian, and International. Be sure to select the correct menu.

Modern VHF sets are capable of transmitting on many more channels than are authorized for any particular type of craft. All boat skippers—commercial and noncommercial—should learn just which channels they are authorized to communicate on, and use only them, to avoid receiving violation citations from the FCC.

##### OPERATING PROCEDURES

Ship-to-ship communications are usually initiated on Channel 16. Immediately after contact is established, both are required to shift to a “working” channel. A typical contact and shift would proceed roughly as follows:

“Bluejay…Bluejay, this is Desolate, over.” (Boat names can be repeated up to three times each, but this is not normally necessary, and is undesirable as it lengthens transmissions.)

“Desolate” (repeated only if necessary because of poor conditions) “this is Bluejay, over.”

“Bluejay, this is Desolate. Switch six-nine, over.”

“This is Bluejay. Roger, six-nine, out.”

(It is desirable to acknowledge the number of the working channel to avoid possible loss of contact when switching due to misunderstanding.)

(Both stations retune to Channel 69.)

“Bluejay, this is Desolate, over.”

“Desolate, this is Bluejay, over.”

(After the necessary exchange of information, either party terminates the call as follows):

“Desolate [or Bluejay], out.”

The procedure words “over” and “out” should never be used together as they have contrary meanings. “Over” (meaning “I require a reply”) should be used at the end of each transmission. “Out” (meaning “I do not require a reply”) should be used by only one station at the end of the communication, and lets other stations know that they can use the channel. The procedure word “roger” (meaning “received and understood”) should never be said more than once.

When the MMSI of another vessel or shore station is known, DSC hailing should be used in place of a voice-hailing call on Channel 16. Reception of the call at the called vessel’s radio will be clearly announced regardless of the setting of the radio’s volume control. If the called radio is set to receive incoming DSC calls, it can automatically switch to the working channel selected by the caller. Communication can begin at once, with no need to use Channel 16.

“Radio check” calls are prohibited on Channel 16. Hailing calls intended to verify the operational status of the radio are permitted if they are made to a specific vessel or a local towing service or other shore station. Many towing service companies will respond to hailing calls made to their MMSIs. The numbers are available from the service companies that have DSC radio equipment.

### Radio Information Services

In the U.S., marine weather information and forecasts are broadcast continuously from many locations by the National Weather Service. In Canada and many other countries, similar continuous weather broadcasts are made by equivalent government agencies.

VHF marine radios have a switch-selectable capability for receiving such broadcasts. There are seven U.S. continuous weather broadcast channels in current use, but nearly all stations use one of the first three. The location, channel number, and coverage area of NWS continuous VHF broadcasts are indicated on Marine Weather Service Charts published by NOAA (see this page). On the Internet, go to www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr to access information on these stations state by state, including location, frequency (but not channel number such as WX-1), and probable coverage area. The Canadian weather service uses the same frequencies; go to http://www.msc.ec.gc.ca/msb/weatheradio/index_e.cfm for station location, frequency, and other information. For a table to be used in converting frequencies to WX channel numbers, go to www.navcen.uscg.gov; other useful frequency information will also be found at this website.

The U.S. Coast Guard may broadcast special safety information, including weather summaries and forecasts, on Channel 22A, the Coast Guard’s assigned working channel. Such special broadcasts are preceded by an alerting announcement (and possible warning tone) transmitted on Channel 16.

## MF-HF SINGLE SIDEBAND (SSB) RADIO SERVICE

VHF radio is intended mainly for short-range communications. Reliable direct voice communication over distances greater than about 25 miles (depending on antenna heights) requires the use either of medium-frequency (MF) and/or high-frequency (HF) radiotelephones, or equipment that sends signals to relaying communications satellites. Satellite communications are discussed in a later section.

Marine radiotelephone equipment that operates in the MF and HF bands is today universally, and by international treaty, of the single sideband (SSB) variety; see Figure 20-08. SSB is amplitude modulated, though it utilizes only a single sideband adjacent to, rather than double sidebands on either side of, a carrier wave. MF and HF marine radio is sometimes referred to as AM radio, but this is a holdover from the days when marine MF and HF sets were of the double sideband (DSB) type—it’s currently more accurate and usual to use the term “SSB” when referring to them.

Figure 20-08 MF-HF single sideband (SSB) transceivers are sold and installed with pretuned channels for many frequencies. A general knowledge of the propagation characteristics of the different frequency bands, and a bit of experience, is needed for the selection of the best band to use at a particular time of day to communicate over a given distance.

### Licensing MF-HF Radios

A vessel cannot be licensed for SSB radiotelephone unless it is already equipped with a VHF/FM set. Moreover, in order to help ease the crowding on the MF and HF bands, an SSB operator is required by law to attempt communication on VHF before using the 2–3 MHz band or higher frequencies—unless the transmitting station is clearly beyond normal VHF range. (MF and HF transmissions carry for very great distances because of signal “bounce,” and SSB signals tend to interfere with one another.)

In most cases, a Restricted Radiotelephone Operator permit is sufficient licensing for SSB operation. That permit is good for equipment up to and including 100-watts carrier wave power or 400-watts peak envelope power (PEP). Higher-level licenses, such as the Marine Radio Operator permit and various commercial radio operator licenses, are valid for SSB operation.

### Selection of SSB Sets

SSB transceivers are commonly available with peak envelope output power from 50 to 150 watts. Unlike the range of VHF transmissions, which is essentially line-of-sight and remains relatively unaffected by output power, the range of SSB transmissions is affected by, among other things, the strength of the radiated signal.

By regulation, all marine SSB radiotelephone stations in the 2-3 MHz band must be able to operate on 2182 kHz, the international distress and calling frequency (the DSC equivalent is 2187.5 kHz). They must also be able to operate on at least two other frequencies. However, in order to achieve maximum utility from an SSB installation, the savvy skipper will usually pick a set with a much wider frequency capability, as frequency selection affects range. Most sets will have the desirable feature of one-button selection of 2182 kHz distress frequency, and some systems will automatically generate the radiotelephone alarm signal on this channel. The frequencies 4125, 6215, 8291, and 12290 kHz may be used for distress and initial calling only. These are all monitored continuously or for various periods of the day by Coast Guard shore communications stations.

The maximum reliable range of SSB transmission in the 2-3 MHz (MF) band during the day is 50 to 150 miles. Transmission in the HF bands can reach for thousands of miles, depending on a number of factors such as the frequency used, atmospheric noise and other interference, the time of day, even the level of sunspot activity. The likely range of signals in the HF bands is discussed on this page.

There are working frequencies in the MF band and each of the HF bands—two, three, or more, some simplex and some half-duplex (often listed as simply “duplex”) in each band. Operating frequencies are usually referred to by a channel number rather than a value in megahertz. These designations consist of three or four digits in which the first one or two are derived from the frequency band in megahertz and the final two digits are assigned sequentially.

Not all HF/SSB radiotelephones are capable of operating on all eight available bands. Less expensive equipment will typically operate on the lower bands—these are fully adequate for skippers who do not need to communicate over the vast distances requiring the higher-frequency bands. Current models use a frequency synthesizer and can operate on any frequency within their overall range, but are factory set to transmit and receive only on authorized channels that can be accessed by simple push-button keypad operation.

Digital Selective Calling (DSC) is also available on SSB sets. DSC-equipped SSB radiotelephones can automatically alert an operator to a call incoming on any of a number of bands without the need to maintain an audio watch. Information on the incoming call will be shown on the radio’s display screen, and all of the information in a distress call will be recorded; in the case of a distress call being received, the set will be automatically switched to 2.182 MHz or an appropriate higher distress frequency.

Skippers who plan to cruise to areas where VHF and MF radio does not afford adequate communications should consider MF-HF sets that can transmit and receive on the working channels used by the Coast Guard for high-seas emergency, voice-weather, navigation information, and medical communications. For information on these channels, go to www.navcen.uscg.gov.

Some models of marine MF-HF equipment are capable of operating on amateur radio bands (see this page) if properly licensed for such use. However, the reverse is not true—sets sold for amateur radio use may be capable of operating on marine frequencies, but should not be used for this purpose as they are not “type accepted” by the FCC for marine communications.

#### Other MF & HF Channels

There are many simplex frequencies and half-duplex frequency pairs in the 2–3 MHz band and in each HF band—too many to list here. Normally, when a marine SSB set is purchased, a list of frequencies or channels is included in or with the operator’s manual. The transceiver will have been factory-tuned to these channels, and all the operator has to do is to know which ones can be used to meet his or her particular communications needs. SSB sets normally have extensive memory capabilities for storing the settings for frequencies and channels commonly used; many of these will have been preprogrammed by the manufacturer.

Information on MF and HF channels and their specific uses can be obtained from the U.S. Coast Guard Navigation Information Center at www.navcen.uscg.gov/marcomms.

Figure 20-09 Single sideband (SSB) radios are desirable, even necessary, for boats that are going to cruise beyond reliable VHF range. Many sets are e-mail capable; some are equipped with DSC. Installation will normally benefit from the services of a properly trained and licensed technician.

### Installation of MF-HF Radios

Installation of MF-HF equipment usually benefits from the services of a trained and licensed technician. Most SSB sets today come pretested and adjusted. Unlike VHF/FM radio, a SSB set requires a large ground plane in order to radiate its signals—which, except on metal hulls, needs to be installed in the form of a large copper mesh panel installed in contact with the interior surface of the below-water part of a fiberglass hull. As well, SSB is much more subject to interference from shipboard electrical equipment, and so often requires the installation of special isolators and noise-suppression filters in the vessel’s electrical system. Sets equipped for DSC should be connected to a GPS receiver so that geographic position information will be transmitted in distress calls and can optionally be sent in routine communications. SSB radios are larger than VHF sets and often come in two units, a “control head” and a “black box” with the remainder of the circuitry.

With MF-HF sets, antenna selection and installation is also more complicated, since SSB generally requires a physically much longer antenna than VHF, and different antenna “tuning” for different bands. Antennas are employed in both “long wire” and whip form, and most SSB systems currently incorporate automatic antenna-tuning couplers. The final choice of one or more antennas should be made in consultation with a qualified technician and in view of the physical limitations imposed by one’s vessel and rigging. Sets equipped with Class D DSC have a second receiver for continuously monitoring DSC frequencies, and this will require a second antenna, which can be a simple whip or short length of wire; no tuner is required.

## THE GLOBAL MARITIME DISTRESS & SAFETY SYSTEM (GMDSS)

After the invention of radio at the end of the 19th century, ships at sea relied on Morse code, invented by Samuel Morse and first used in 1844, for distress and safety telecommunications; refer to Figure 20-16. The need for ship and coast radio stations to have and use radiotelegraph equipment and to listen to a common radio frequency for Morse-encoded distress calls was recognized after the sinking of the liner Titanic in the North Atlantic in 1912. The U.S. Congress enacted legislation soon afterward requiring U.S. ships to use Morse code radiotelegraph equipment for distress calls. The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), now a United Nations agency, followed suit for ships of all nations. Morse-code distress calling saved thousands of lives since its inception almost a century ago, but its use requires skilled radio operators spending many hours listening to the radio distress frequency. Its range on the medium-frequency (MF) distress band (500 kHz) was limited, and the amount of traffic Morse signals could carry was also limited.

### The Development of GMDSS

The International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations agency specializing in safety of shipping and preventing ships from polluting the seas, began looking at ways of improving maritime distress and safety communications in the mid-1970s. In 1979, a group of experts drafted the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, which called for development of a global search and rescue plan. This group also passed a resolution calling for development by IMO of a Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) to provide the communication support needed to implement the search and rescue plan. This new system, which the world’s maritime nations, including the United States, have implemented, is based upon a combination of satellite and terrestrial radio services, and has changed international distress communications from being primarily ship-to-ship based to ship-to-shore (Rescue Coordination Center) based. It ended the mandatory requirement for Morse code communication by commercial vessels. The GMDSS provides for automatic distress alerting and locating in cases where a radio operator doesn’t have time to send an SOS or Mayday call, and, for the first time, requires ships to receive broadcasts of maritime safety information that could prevent a distress from happening in the first place. In 1988, IMO amended the Safety of Life at Sea Convention (SOLAS), requiring ships subject to it to fit GMDSS equipment. Such ships were required to carry NAVTEX (see this page) and satellite EPIRBs (see next page) by 1993, and had to fit all other GMDSS equipment by 1999. U.S. ships were allowed to fit GMDSS in lieu of Morse telegraphy equipment by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.

The GMDSS consists of several systems, some of which are new but many of which have been in operation for years. The system is able to reliably perform the following functions: alerting (including position determination of the unit in distress), search and rescue coordination, locating (homing), maritime safety information broadcasts, general communications, and bridge-to-bridge communications. Specific radio carriage requirements depend upon the ship’s area of operation (see next page) rather than its tonnage. The system also provides redundant means of distress alerting and emergency sources of power.

### Features of GMDSS

The Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) is an automated ship-to-shore system using satellites and digital selective calling (DSC) technology. Significant advantages are provided over the former system. GMDSS:

• Provides worldwide ship-to-shore alerting; it is not dependent upon passing ships.

• Simplifies radio operations; alerts may be sent by two simple actions.

• Ensures redundancy of communications; it requires two separate systems for alerting.

• Enhances search and rescue; operations are coordinated from shore centers.

• Minimizes unanticipated emergencies at sea; maritime safety broadcasts are included.

• Eliminates reliance on a single person for communications; it requires at least two licensed GMDSS radio operators and typically two maintenance methods to ensure distress communications capability at all times.

#### Sea Areas

GMDSS uses four coverage areas: A1, A2, A3, and A4 to cover the sea areas of the world for distress watchkeeping.

• Sea Area A1 is within radiotelephone range of at least one VHF/DSC coast station (about 20–30 NM).

• Sea Area A2 is an area within MF range of a coast station fitted with DSC (about 150 miles).

• Sea Area A3 is an area covered by the Inmarsat Satellite System (excluding Al and A2 areas).

• Sea Area A4 is basically the polar regions, which are not covered by the above.

### GMDSS Components

The GMDSS consists of a number of components that are being implemented in a coordinated and agreed-upon manner. These include:

#### The COSPAS-SARSAT System

COSPAS-SARSAT is an international satellite-based search-and-rescue (SAR) system established by Canada, France, the U.S., and Russia. Operational use of COSPAS-SARSAT began with the rescue response to an airplane crash in Canada in 1982; since then, some 24,000 lives have been saved through COSPAS-SARSAT from aircraft and vessels in distress. The operational core of the system is provided by two groups of satellites, one in low-earth orbit (LEOSAR satellites) and the other in geostationary orbit at higher altitude (GEOSAR satellites). Together, these satellites provide worldwide reception of distress signals at all times, relaying those signals to ground receiving stations known as local user terminals (LUTs). These process the signals and forward them to mission control centers (MCCs), which in turn forward them to rescue coordination centers (RCCs) for response.

### Emergency Position-Indicating RadioBeacon (EPIRB)

Every boat that goes offshore beyond reliable VHF radio range—roughly 20 miles (37 km)—should carry an EPIRB (emergency position-indicating radiobeacon). The original models, which should no longer be used, operated on two frequencies: 121.5 MHz, the emergency channel for civilian planes, and 243.0 MHz, the “guard” channel for military aircraft. First-generation EPIRBs suffered from interference on their working frequencies, and the units had a high incidence of false alarms—as many as 95-plus percent of such EPIRB alerts were determined to be nonemergency situations. Because of this, the processing of signals from Class A and B units by the COSPAS-SARSAT system was discontinued on 1 February 2009. Only 406 MHz signals are now monitored.

#### The Second Generation

Advances in technology have led to the development of a new type, referred to as a “406” EPIRB—the name derived from its operating frequency of 406.0 MHz. This is a dedicated frequency free of interference from other communications. Beacon signals are picked up by orbiting satellites of COSPAS-SARSAT. The distress signals are transmitted to a ground station and passed on to rescue authorities. If a ground station is not in view when the distress signals are received, they are stored by the satellite for retransmission when one comes within range. The distress signals can also be received and relayed by GEOS weather satellites and other geostationary satellites of the GEOSAR system.

When COSPAS-SARSAT satellites are used, position is determined by the Doppler effect of the signals and may take 1 to 2 hours. Location is determined within 1 to 3 miles (2 to 5 km). If the signals are detected by a GEOSAR satellite, the distress alert is immediate but no position information is provided.

A major advantage of second-generation equipment is that each 406 EPIRB (see Figure 20-10) transmits a unique registration number for identification. Each unit is entered into a database that provides vital information on the vessel’s name and characteristics, its owner, a point of contact, etc. The purchaser of a 406 EPIRB is legally required to register it immediately; there are penalties for failing to comply. For information, call 888-212-7283 within the U.S. or 1-301-817-4515. The beacon may be registered online, or a registration form obtained, at www.sarsat.noaa.gov. A confirmation letter will be sent, plus a proof-of-registration decal that must be affixed to the EPIRB. In order to keep the database current, registration is for two years only, and re-registration is required. Any change in EPIRB registration data must be reported online or in writing without delay—it is essential for your safety that the information on file is correct and current. There are no fees, and registration may save your life. Once activated, EPIRBs must transmit at least 48 hours even in the most adverse circumstances.

Figure 20-10 A position-indicating radiobeacon (EPIRB) of the newer type operating on 406 MHz is an essential safety item for a boat cruising farther from shore than reliable VHF radio range. When activated, a distress signal is picked up by an orbiting or geostationary satellite and relayed to rescue authorities ashore. All “406” EPIRBs transmit an identification number that has been registered with government authorities after purchase. Advanced models can be interfaced with a GPS receiver to include the position of the vessel; some units even have an internal GPS receiver that can continue to send location data even after being carried off from an abandoned vessel.

The 406 EPIRBs are available in Category l (float-free, automatic activation, now required on SOLAS ships and commercial fishing vessels) and Category II (manual activation). Both models have a 121.5 MHz beacon for final search and a strobe light for final location. These EPIRBs are considerably more expensive, but their far greater effectiveness makes them worthwhile. Prices range from $500 to $650 for Category II units; Category I models are $50 to $100 more expensive. For occasional needs, 406 EPIRBs can be rented from the BoatU.S. Foundation for Boating Safety; 888-663-7472, or www.boatus.com/foundation/EPIRB.

##### PERSONAL LOCATOR BEACON (PLB)

A personal locator beacon (plb) can serve much the same needs of a boater as an EPIRB. A PLB is intended to be associated with an individual—a hiker, hunter, mountain climber, and of course, a boater—rather than with a vessel. It is smaller and lighter, and transmits the same 406 and 121.5 MHz signals. It transmits a distress message with identification that is specific to that unit. Some models may have an input for GPS position data, while newer models have internal GPS included. Newer models also have a strobe light, are waterproof, and will float. A crew overboard in poor visibility has a much greater chance of being rescued if equipped with a PLB.

For several years PLBs have been in wide use in Europe and other parts of the world. The sale and use of PLBs in the U.S. is authorized by the FCC. These units must be registered.

#### And Now We Have…

A further development is a model of a 406 EPIRB with a connection for position data from an onboard GPS receiver being used for navigation. The vessel’s position is continually updated and stored in the EPIRB every 20 minutes. Such a beacon not only alerts for a distress situation and identifies itself, it also transmits its location. Reports from GEOSAR satellites, as well as COSPAS-SARSAT, will carry position information.

And yet another development is a 406 EPIRB with an internal GPS receiver (sometimes called a “GPIRB”). Upon being activated, the GPS will determine its position within about 2 minutes and add that data to the transmitted signal. The GPS then shuts down to conserve battery power, but every 20 minutes it reactivates and provides a new position. Rescue authorities can use successive positions to determine drift should the EPIRB cease functioning.

The cost of an EPIRB with GPS interconnect capability is little more than that of a standard 406 EPIRB: $400 to $600. A GPIRB, with integral GPS receiver, is about $750 to $800. But with both such units, the distress location is clearly established to less than a half mile (0.8 km).

What might be seen by boaters as a “weakness” in the use of EPIRBs is the fact that they have no way of knowing if/when the signals have been received and rescue action initiated.

#### Use & Maintenance

Once any EPIRB is activated, it must be left on. To turn it off “to save the battery” severely disrupts rescue operations. Testing must be strictly limited to conditions stated in the unit’s manual.

The only maintenance required is the replacement of the battery at the intervals specified by the unit’s manual.

## NAVTEX

Navtex is an international, automated system for instantly distributing maritime navigational warnings, weather forecasts and warnings, search-and-rescue notices, and similar safety information to ships; see Figure 20-11.

Figure 20-11 A NAVTEX receiver is a small unit that receives navigation information, weather warning, search-and-rescue information, and related safety data from a series of shore stations all transmitting on the same frequency at different scheduled times. Some models print out the information on paper tape; other units display the information on an LCD screen. All received data are stored for later review.

A small, low-cost, and self-contained “smart” printing radio receiver installed in the pilot house of a ship or boat checks each incoming message to see if it has been received during an earlier transmission, or if it is of a category of no interest to the ship’s master. The original NAVTEX receivers printed messages on a roll of adding-machine-size paper. Certain types of messages could be set to “non-print.” More recent models show the information on a LCD screen, with printing possible through a connection to a personal computer’s printer.

A new ship coming into the area will receive many previously broadcast messages for the first time; ships already in the area that had already received the message won’t receive it again. No person needs to be present during a broadcast to receive vital information.

There is a large number of transmitting stations, all operating at scheduled times on 518 kHz. NAVTEX reception extends out to a range of 200 to 400 nautical miles.

#### Inmarsat

Some satellite systems operated by the International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), are also important elements of the GMDSS. The Inmarsat A, B, M, and Fleet 77, Fleet 55, and Fleet 33 systems provide ship-shore, ship-ship, and shore-ship telephone, telex, and high-speed data services, including a distress priority telephone and telex service to and from rescue coordination centers. Inmarsat M and Mini-M equipment is small and lighter, and costs much less.

The voiceless Inmarsat C and Mini-C provide ship-shore, shore-ship, and ship-ship store-and-forward data and telex messaging, the capability for sending preformatted distress messages to a rescue coordination center, and the SafetyNET service, a satellite-based worldwide maritime safety information broadcast service of high-seas weather warnings, NAVAREA navigational warnings, radionavigation warnings, ice reports and warnings, and other information not provided by NAVTEX. SafetyNET works similarly to NAVTEX in areas outside NAVTEX coverage. Inmarsat C and Mini-C equipment is small and lighter, and costs much less than an Inmarsat A, B, or Fleet F77.

Inmarsat A, B, and Fleet F77 and F55 ship earth stations require relatively large gyrostabilized antennas; the antenna size of the Fleet 33, Inmarsat C, and Mini-C is much smaller.

Fleet F33 provides voice, fax, and data for smaller vessels.

Under a cooperative agreement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), combined meteorological observations and AMVER reports can now be sent to both the USCG AMVER Center and NOAA, using an Inmarsat C ship-earth station, at no charge. There is also no charge to register for this service and to receive the necessary Inmarsat C software. For more information, see the NOAA SEAS (Shipboard Environmental [data] Acquisition System). It is strongly urged that Inmarsat C equipment have an integral satellite navigation receiver or be externally connected to a satellite navigation receiver.

#### High-Frequency Communications

The GMDSS includes HF radiotelephone and radiotelex (narrow-band direct-printing) equipment, with calls initiated by digital selective calling. Worldwide broadcasts of maritime safety information are also made on HF narrow-band direct printing channels.

To meet these GMDSS requirements, the Coast Guard has improved high-frequency (HF) ship-shore radio safety services from its Communication Stations to the maritime community, as well as narrow-band direct-printing broadcasts.

#### SART (Search-And-Rescue Radar Transponder)

The GMDSS installation on ships includes one or more search-and-rescue radar transponders, devices that are used to locate survival craft or distressed vessels by creating a series of dots on a rescuing ship’s X-band (3 cm) radar display. The detection range between these devices and ships, dependent upon the height of the ship’s radar mast and the height of the SART, is normally about eight nautical miles. Note that a marine radar may not detect a SART even within this distance if the radar settings are not optimized for SART detection.

#### Digital Selective Calling

The IMO also introduced digital selective calling (DSC) on VHF, MF, and HF maritime radios as part of the GMDSS system. DSC distress alerts, which consist of a preformatted distress message, are used to initiate emergency communications with ships and rescue coordination centers. The VHF, MF, and HF DSC systems can automatically respond to an incoming distress, “All Ships,” or routine hailing call and will alert a watchstander regardless of the setting of the receiving radio’s volume control. As a result, the requirement for an audio listening watch on 2182 kHz was discontinued in 1999. All vessels and shore stations must continue to maintain a listening watch on VHF Channel 16, however.

It is urged that DSC-equipped VHF and MF/HF radios be externally connected to a satellite navigation receiver. That connection will ensure that accurate location information is sent to a rescue coordination center if a distress alert is ever transmitted. FCC regulations require that an updated position be manually entered into the radio every four hours on any ship required to carry GMDSS equipment.

Since most SOLAS ships have discontinued watchkeeping on MF radiotelephone channels, other vessels will have to use DSC-equipped radios to contact these ships, particularly in passing situations, and especially when outside U.S. waters. It is considered essential that VHF, MF, and HF radiotelephone equipment carried on ships should include a DSC capability as a matter of safety. To achieve this, the FCC has required that all VHF and MF/HF maritime radiotelephones type-accepted after June 1999 have at least a basic DSC capability.

VHF digital selective calling also has other capabilities beyond those required for the GMDSS. The Coast Guard uses this system to track vessels in Prince William Sound, Alaska, Vessel Traffic Service. IMO and the USCG also require ships carry a Universal Automatic Identification System (AIS), which will be DSC-compatible. Countries having a GMDSS A1 Area will be able to identify and track AIS-equipped vessels in its waters without any additional radio equipment.

A DSC radio may, at the option of the operator, be set to respond to a position request signal by transmitting latitude and longitude information from a connected GPS receiver.

##### AUTOMATIC IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM (AIS)

Most small-craft skippers may not be participating actively in the automatic identification system (AIS) for ships, but they should have general knowledge of what it is and how it works.

AIS is a major advance in safety at sea. It allows ships to exchange identity (MMSI number), position, course and speed over ground, and rate of turn. Information is broadcast every 2 to 10 seconds as determined by a vessel’s speed and whether or not turning—more frequently for faster speeds and vessels changing course; every 3 minutes if anchored. Other data transmitted every 6 minutes include vessel name, radio call sign, type of ship and cargo, size, draft, destination, and time of arrival.

This high-technology system uses data links on VHF Channels 87B and 88B to exchange information. AIS transponders continuously transmit whether near shore or on the high seas. Using very precise timing, the system provides for automatic sharing of the channels used so that a vessel does not interfere with others; several thousand vessels could be in the same area without a problem. There are two classes of AIS installations: Class A includes all features; Class B has more limited capabilities, but sufficient to adequately participate in the system.

AIS coast stations may merely monitor ship transmissions, or may actively interrogate vessels to get destination, ETA, type of cargo, and other data. AIS can be integrated into Vessel Traffic Systems at entrances to ports. Shore stations can transmit warnings, port data, pilotage and berth assignment, and other information.

Vessels not required to participate in AIS can install less expensive ($200–$600) receive-only units that will greatly aid in identifying radar targets in waters used by commercial shipping. Knowing the name and MMSI of an approaching ship can ease the anxiety of a boater.

More information on AIS can be found at www.navcen.uscg.gov.

#### Use of GMDSS for Routine Communications

GMDSS telecommunications equipment should not be reserved for emergency use only. The International Maritime Organization in COMSAR Circular 17 encourages mariners to use that equipment for routine as well as safety telecommunications.

### Boaters & the GMDSS

Small craft are not directly concerned with the mandatory equipment requirements of GMDSS, but boaters who will be operating in waters used by compulsorily equipped vessels may benefit generally with the several forms of communications services provided by GMDSS.

VHF/DSC radios automatically monitor Channel 70 for incoming DSC hailing calls and will alert the user of all distress, distress relay, “All Ships” hailing calls, and any hailing call addressed to the MMSI programmed in the radio. If a distress call is received, the calling vessel’s MMSI and lat/long (if included in the distress call message) will be displayed on the LCD, and the radio will switch to Channel 16. Regulations require that a continuous listening watch be maintained on Channel 16 regardless of the availability of the DSC monitoring function.

International Class D VHF/DSC radios maintain a continuous listening watch for hailing calls on Channel 70 except when the radio is transmitting. When underway, an audio listening watch must be maintained on Channel 16 except when the radio is being used to receive weather information or for communication on a working channel. When operating in the vicinity of commercial traffic, a radio equipped with a dual-watch facility should be set to monitor Channel 13, the bridge-to-bridge channel, in addition to Channel 16. If operating in a vessel traffic service area, maintain a watch on their working channel in place of, or in addition to, Channel 13.

## OTHER RADIO COMMUNICATIONS

Other forms of “two-way” radio found on board recreational vessels include citizens band (CB) radio, amateur (“ham”) radio, Family Radio System (FRS), General Mobile Radio System (GMRS), cellular and satellite telephones, and other forms of satellite systems. However, none can be considered a substitute for true marine radio, since only the designated marine frequencies are monitored continuously for distress calls by the USCG and the search and rescue bodies of other countries.

Access to the Internet is desired by just about all cruising skippers. A variety of means is available: cell phone networks, HF/SSB radio channels, satellite links, and others.

### Citizens Band Radio Service

As its name implies, the Citizens Band Radio Service is intended to give the general public economical access to two-way radio communications. CB sets are relatively inexpensive, easy to install, and simple to operate; see Figure 20-12. The CB service has its own particular functions, and these do not overlap or conflict with other established services. It is not a substitute for the safety features of the regular VHF marine radio service, nor for ship-to-shore connections into the public telephone service, nor is it a type of hobby or amateur service for casual contacts at great distances. While CB use is not now as widespread as it was three decades ago, it still is available and can meet particular communications needs of some boaters.

Figure 20-12 Citizens band (CB) radios can serve a useful purpose on recreational boats as they do not have the restriction of marine radios against personal and social conversations. Models for both fixed installation and handheld use are available at relatively inexpensive prices.

#### CB Channels & Equipment

CB is allocated 40 specific frequencies between 29.965 and 27.405 MHz, commonly referred to as channels 1 through 40. Any channel may be used with single or double sideband amplitude modulation (although older 23-channel sets are compatible with newer 40-channel sets only on channels 1 to 23). Except for Channel 9, reserved for “emergency communications involving the immediate safety of life or the immediate protection of property, or for traveler assistance,” no channel is assigned to a particular use or user group.

Sets are available as full-size units or handhelds. More expensive models have features such as dual watch, one-touch access for Channels 9 and 19, weather radio access and continuous monitoring, and others. All CB sets must be unmodified FCC-certified units. If not manufactured for marine use, a CB set must be well protected from the relatively harsh environmental conditions found on boats.

CB stations are limited to 4 watts carrier wave output power on DSB AM, and 12 watts PEP on SSB AM. The usual reliable range of CB is 5 miles, but may, in favorable conditions, extend to 15 or more. These are ranges for ground waves; sky waves can sometimes reach and be received thousands of miles away. For this reason, external power amplifiers are strictly prohibited by regulation—although some CB “outlaws” illegally boost the output power of their sets many times over. Such illegal power amplification crowds the airwaves and interferes with the intended purpose as a medium for local communications. FCC rules strictly prohibit CB communication between stations more than 155.3 miles (250 km) apart.

#### CB Operation

CB radio operation does not require a license, and there are no specific operating procedures. But the FCC does require:

• That all communications be restricted to the minimum practical transmission time.

• That exchanges between stations be limited to a maximum 5-minute duration.

• That when exchanges have reached the 5-minute limit, both stations remain off the air for a minimum of 1 minute.

• These rules do not apply in any case involving emergency communications.

CB communications may be in any language, but use of any code other than the “ten code” is prohibited. Station identification is encouraged, though not required; and its form is only “suggested.” Common practice is to use a CB “handle” or nickname, though the FCC encourages this only in conjunction with a call sign composed of the letter K followed by the operator’s initials and residence ZIP code or an organization name and unit number. “Handles” alone are preferred by many operators because they are untraceable.

A CB station may not be used for any illegal activity, to transmit music or sound effects, to advertise the sale or solicit the sale of goods and services, to intentionally interfere with another CB station, or any of several other actions set forth in the FCC Rules. Profane, obscene, or indecent language is specifically prohibited.

CB radios can be used wherever the FCC has jurisdiction on land and on vessels and aircraft (with permission of the captain); they may be used in international waters. They are not authorized for use on land or waters under the jurisdiction of a foreign nation (except Canada), but that country might have its own equivalent service.

If you want to install a CB set on your boat, be sure the unit chosen is designed or adapted for conditions at sea. You should use an antenna specifically intended for marine applications; the standard automotive-type will not function satisfactorily.

### Family Radio Service

The Family Radio Service (FRS) is a direct outgrowth of the CB Service. It is the result of advances in technology and the availability of additional frequencies. It carries the same general types of communications, but at lesser ranges—no more than two miles, and often much less.

FRS units are small, not much larger than cell phones, and quite inexpensive; see Figure 20-13. They must be FCC-certified units, but no license is required; there are no age or citizenship restrictions. Power is limited to not more than 0.5 watt; the antenna must be nondetachable; no external amplifier may be attached to increase the range. Some units are water-resistant; some include a receiver for VHF continuous weather broadcasts. Although usually handheld, models are available that can be worn as a headset. Some models have an integrated GPS receiver and some are part of a marine VHF handheld.

Figure 20-13 Inexpensive handheld radios of the Family Radio Service (FRS) can be very useful in boating. Although their range is quite limited, they can be used for onboard communications, to a dinghy, or to a person on shore. Multiple channels with subgroup codes are available; no license is required. They can interconnect with radios of the higher-powered licensed General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS).

#### Using the FRS

The FRS operates on 14 channels in the 462 MHz portion of the spectrum; the least expensive models may operate on only one or several of these channels. There are 38 “quiet codes” (tones), one of which can be transmitted to activate a specific station with whom you wish to communicate—this lessens the annoyance of others using the same channel. You may use the FRS unit to transmit one-way communications only to establish communications with another person, send an emergency message, provide traveler assistance, make a voice page, or to conduct a brief test. There is no specific assigned use for any channel. You must share any channel with other users; no channel is available for the exclusive use for any person or group. Emergency communications take precedence over other traffic. FRS radios may not be connected to the public landline telephone service.

FRS radios have the same geographic authorizations and restrictions as CB stations as noted earlier. On larger boats some skippers use FRS radios to communicate with crew on the boat while anchoring. Others use it instead of VHF handhelds to maintain contact on shore or from dock to dinghy or primary vessel.

The Multi-Use Radio Service (MURS) is a generally similar unlicensed service with four channels near 150 MHz. There are marine VHF handhelds that can receive MURS channels.

### General Mobile Radio Service

The General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS) is a personal radio service available to an individual person. It is a two-way voice communication service to facilitate the activities of that individual’s immediate family members. Before any station transmits on any channel authorized in the GMRS from any point within or over the territorial limits of any area where radio services are regulated by the FCC, the responsible party must obtain a license for a GMRS system. An individual 18 years of age or older, who is not a representative of a foreign government, is eligible to apply for a GMRS system license. Application for a GMRS system license is made on FCC Form 605. The fee for a GMRS license is $85, and the license is good for five years.

#### GMRS Systems

Each GMRS system consists of station operators, a mobile station (often comprised of several mobile units) and sometimes one or more land stations. A small base station is one that has an antenna no more than 20 feet above the ground or above the tree on which it is mounted.

Normally, you and your family members would communicate between yourselves over the general area of your residence, such as an urban or rural area. This area must be within the territorial limits of the fifty United States, the District of Columbia, and the Caribbean and Pacific Insular areas. In transient use, mobile station units from one GMRS system may communicate with mobile station units from other GMRS systems with certain restrictions.

There are twenty-three GMRS channels in the 462 and 467 MHz portions of the spectrum. The GMRS is a higher-powered, licensed extension of the Family Radio Service—seven of the GMRS channels match channels of the FRS, and intercommunication is allowed. In addition there are eight other GMRS channels for simplex use. None of the GMRS channels are assigned for the exclusive use of any individual or organization. Licensees must cooperate in the selection and use of the channels in order to make the most effective use of them and to reduce the possibility of interference. Other channels are for duplex systems and for relay stations.

Every GMRS system station operator must cooperate in sharing the assigned channel with station operators in other GMRS systems by monitoring the channel before initiating transmissions, waiting until communications in progress are completed before initiating transmissions, engaging in only permissible communications and limiting transmissions to the minimum practical transmission time.

GMRS stations may use up to 5 watts effective radiated power. Expect a communications range of 5 to 25 miles. You cannot make a telephone call with a GMRS unit.

### Amateur Radio

Amateur (“ham”) radio is used worldwide, with capabilities for both short- and long-range communications. It is authorized for personal, but not business, communications; it is useful to boaters who cruise to faraway ports, and who want to communicate economically over very long distances.

Ham radio is assigned a multiplicity of frequency bands from 1.8 to 450 MHz, with additional specialized bands up to 250,000 MHz, in fact more frequencies than marine VHF/FM or SSB. One of the major workhorse ham frequencies is 14.300 MHz, where members of relay “nets” meet to handle permissible traffic and arrange landline telephone patches for mobile marine stations. Because of this network, ham radio can be useful to communicate across great distances with people who may or may not have access to marine radiotelephone equipment. A ham station at the National Hurricane Center, WX4NHC, operates the Hurricane Watch Net on 14.325 MHz, Waterway Net on 7.268 MHz.

Radiotelegraph (Morse code), radiotelephone (SSB or FM), radioteletype, data, and television signals are all transmitted by properly licensed ham operators on specified subbands. Indeed, some hams even “moon-bounce” signals.

#### Regulations & Licensing

The rules governing ham operations do not provide for a specific emergency channel, but several frequencies—such as 7.268 MHz and 14.325 MHz—have historically been used as emergency channels and are regularly monitored by hams worldwide.

Amateur radio operation requires both a station and an operator license. Ham operator’s licenses are issued in different grades—in ascending order, Technician, General, and Amateur Extra. (The former grades of Novice, Technician Plus, and Advanced have been “grandfathered” into the new system; new licenses of these grades are no longer being issued.) Each grade up grants the operator wider access to assigned bands and different modes. The holder of a General class license can operate on portions of all ham bands; an Amateur Extra license grants access to otherwise restricted sub-bands within the regular band limits.

A ham operator license is not overly easy to obtain, but neither is it impossible for anyone who seriously desires it and will devote time to study for the exam, which covers operating procedures and technical topics – study guides are available. The deletion of Morse code ability has opened up ham radio to a much wider field of boaters.

Equipment for amateur radio stations on boats is generally the same as on shore, requiring 12 volts DC, available from the craft’s normal power system. However, such gear is not manufactured for the marine environment and must be installed in a well-protected location. Marine transceivers can be used for ham communications if they can operate those frequencies, but ham sets cannot be used on marine channels as they are not “type accepted” for such use. Antennas face the same problems as covered on this page.

Additional information can be obtained from stores that sell ham radio equipment, by mail from the American Radio Relay League, Newington, CT 06111, or on the Internet at www.arrl.org.

### Cellular Telephones

Cellular telephone systems use a large number of transceiving antennas/stations. Each one serves a limited geographic area, called a cell, and is linked together through relay and controlling stations into a network. That network is further connected to the landline telephone system. Although the range of both a cellular telephone and a cell antenna/station is relatively short, the ultimate calling range of the system is very great because of the ability to connect a cell call to the world-wide land-based telephone network.

Each cellular telephone (actually a radiotelephone) has its own identifier code. When a call is placed to a cellular phone, the network tries to contact it by broadcasting its code.

#### Advantages & Disadvantages of Cellular Phones for Boaters

The major advantages of the system are:

• Its user interface is much the same as with the standard telephone network, so operator licensing is not required.

• It affords mobile users full access to land-based telephone systems, and vice versa.

• It employs relatively short-range radio technology (that avoids overcongestion of the air-waves), while overall affording users the capabilities for long-range communications.

The maximum range of a cellular phone to and from a cell station varies but is basically line-of-sight. In some circumstances, coverage range can be only a few miles; in others, it can be a near equivalent of VHF radio. Range for boaters is further complicated by the fact that most cell stations are placed with land-based use in mind, so the distance offshore that a vessel can stay in contact with a cell station is often short. The limited range of a cell phone on a boat can be significantly increased if its small on-unit antenna is replaced by a fixed marine-type antenna mounted as high as practical on the craft. The range can be increased if its fraction-of-a-watt output is increased to two or three watts by an external amplifier or onboard repeater before being sent to the antenna.

A cellular phone can be useful and extremely convenient, but it is no substitute for proper marine radiotelephony when it comes to safety. The call for help will not be heard by other vessels that may be nearby, and Coast Guard and other assistance towing vessels do not have the capability of radio direction finding on cell phone transmissions. In some assistance cases, Coast Guard units have been known to ask if the vessel concerned has a cellular phone, with the objective of shifting communications to that mode with more positive contact and no interference from other stations. If phone service is available, check local telephone information service for Coast Guard phone numbers.

Cellular telephone service is continually improving because of expanding service areas and advancing technology. Mergers of major cellular phone service providers have resulted in improved networks.

Boaters should seek the latest available information from both equipment manufacturers and network service providers before making decisions regarding equipment selection or the purchase of cellular telephone service.

### Satellite Telephones

Satellite telephone systems send and receive their voice and data messages using numerous satellites orbiting about 500 miles in space. The two major satphone systems are Iridium and Globalstar. Iridium, with its 66 low-earth-orbiting (LEO) satellites, has worldwide coverage for handheld units and installed data terminals. Globalstar has less than worldwide coverage, but it does include all of North and South America and the Caribbean out to about 200 miles offshore.

The advantages of these systems are instantaneous voice and data connections on land and sea; large coverage areas (especially Iridium), and easy-to-use hardware. New or rebuilt handsets can be purchased for between $500 and $1,800. A wide variety of calling plans is available and offers per-minute pricing that can be less than $1.00 per minute. Data messages, including e-mail, can be exchanged, with compression techniques used to speed transmission.

### Other Satellite Communications

Satellite communications systems (SATCOM) beam signals via earth-based and orbiting space relay stations. SATCOM affords users full access to voice, telex, facsimile, television and data networks. It is now practical for vessels down to 40 feet in length; see Figure 20-14.

Figure 20-14 Craft of roughly 20 feet length or more can be fitted for satellite service—voice, data, television, or a combination of these. Antennas within a “dome” are stabilized to keep them pointed in the correct direction regardless of motions of the vessel. Domes will vary in size depending upon the service used.

Ship-to-shore, ship-to-ship, and shore-to-ship communications are made via Coast Earth Stations (CES), the links into the network’s space segment for onshore subscribers. In the U.S., the CES are operated by Telenor Satellite Services (formerly COMSAT), which provides access to the worldwide satellite communications space segments supplied by the International Maritime Satellite Organization (Inmarsat).

Procedures for placing and receiving calls via Inmarsat are highly automated. CES Maritime Services operators give directory, calling and related assistance on a 24-hour, 7-day-per-week basis. The operators also provide distress assistance in concert with governmental rescue coordination centers.

The shipboard unit used for linking into the Inmarsat system is designated a Ship Earth Station (SES). There are a number of distinct types of SES, each providing a different array of access capabilities to the Inmarsat satellites and thereby to worldwide public telex and telephone networks.

There are many different Inmarsat services. Fleet Broadband, primarily used by large vessels, provides high speed data and voice with speeds up to 432kbps. Its shipboard terminal uses a large, stabilized, tracking dish antenna that is suitable only for large vessels.

Fleet 77, 55, and 33 provide a combination of global voice and fax communications, mobile ISDN data at 64 and 128kbps, and IP-based mobile packet data service for e-mail and web browsing.

Inmarsat C and Mini C provide low cost store-and-forward message and distress calling services and are a part of GMDSS.

Inmarsat D+ provides 2-way data communication for data transfer, remote monitoring, and tracking.

Inmarsat-M and Mini-M have a small digital voice terminal with a simplified tracking dish antenna. M has global coverage; Mini-M has coverage only in areas served by “spot beams” from the satellite antenna.

IsatPhone, a lightweight pocket-size dual mode satellite and GSM (cellular) phone has been introduced with service in most of Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia as of 2012.

## VIOLATIONS & PENALTIES

You should never be in violation of the FCC Rules and you should have no need for the knowledge of the procedures and penalties involved. Yet things do not always work out that way, so it is just as well to be informed.

If you receive a citation of violation from the FCC, you must reply in duplicate within ten days, to the office that issued the citation. If a complete reply cannot be given in that time, send an interim reply and supplement it as soon as possible. If for reasons beyond your control you cannot reply at all within ten days, do so at the earliest date practicable, and fully support your reasons for the delay. Each letter to the FCC must be complete and contain all the facts without cross-reference to other correspondence.

The answer must contain a full explanation of the incident and describe the actions taken to prevent a recurrence of it. If personnel errors are involved, your reply must state the name and license number of the operator concerned.

You may be lucky, however, and receive a warning notice rather than a citation. Generally in this instance, no reply is required. The FCC form that you receive will indicate whether or not an answer is necessary. If one is required, don’t get yourself into further trouble by failing to answer within ten days.

#### Revocation & Suspension of License

A station license may be revoked for any one of a number of specified violations of the Communications Act or the FCC Rules. Operator licenses and permits normally are not revoked but are suspended for varying periods of time, up to the balance of the license term. Notice of suspension must be given in writing and is not effective until 15 days after receipt. Within this period, you can apply for a hearing, and this automatically defers the suspension until after the hearing has been held and the FCC has ruled.

#### Fines Imposed

In addition to the revocation or suspension of licenses, the FCC can prosecute violators in the Federal District Courts. Any violation of the Communications Act may be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. A second offense, not necessarily a repeat of the first, increases the minimum limit on the prison term to two years. For a violation of any FCC rule, regulation, restriction, or condition, or of any treaty provision, a court may additionally impose a fine of not more than $500 for each and every day during which the violation occurred.

#### Administrative Forfeitures

To avoid the delays, costs, and cumbersome procedures of formal court prosecutions, the FCC has the authority to levy its own administrative forfeitures—actually small fines—for 12 specific violations. These are in addition to any other penalties that may be imposed by law.

Among these twelve, the violations of principal concern to the operators of radio stations on boats are:

• Transmission of any unauthorized communications on a distress or calling frequency.

• Failure to identify the station at the times and in the manner prescribed by the FCC rules.

• Interference with a distress call or distress communications.

• Operation of a station without a valid permit or license of the proper grade.

• Transmission of any false call contrary to the FCC rules.

• Failure to respond to official communications from the FCC.

The maximum forfeiture for a single violation, or a series of violations all falling within a single category as listed above, is $100. If more than one category is involved, however, the maximum liability is raised to $500 for a station licensee, or $400 for an individual operator. Note that the term “operator” may be applied to any person using the equipment, whether or not licensed by the FCC. In some cases, if two different persons are involved in an incident involving one station, forfeitures may be assessed against both station licensee and the person who was operating the station.

The procedures for the imposition of these administrative fines have been kept simple, yet ample protection is afforded to the rights of individuals. Upon receipt of a notice of apparent liability for forfeiture, the addressed person has three possible courses of action. He can pay the fine and so close the incident; or he may, within 30 days, submit a written statement to the FCC giving the reasons why he should be allowed to pay a lesser fine, or none at all; or he may request an interview with an FCC official. These last two courses of action can be combined, submitting both an explanation and a request for an interview. If either or both of these actions are taken, the FCC will review all information relating to the case, and make a final determination.

There is no judicial appeal from the FCC’s ruling, and it is best to pay up, as there are established procedures for turning over cases of nonpayment to a U.S. District Attorney’s office for prosecution.

## OTHER MEANS OF COMMUNICATIONS

There is often a need for communications at very short distances—a few yards to perhaps a quarter or half mile from the boat, or on board the boat itself.

### Hailers

For voice communications boat-to-boat or boat-to-shore over distances up to a hundred yards or so, a loud hailer is very useful. This may be either an installed item of equipment or a portable power megaphone; an installed unit will have the most power and greatest range, but a handheld model will be more convenient on smaller motorboats and on sailboats and will allow sounds to be focused in a particular direction.

Various models of installed hailers offer additional useful features such as auxiliary use as a foghorn, perhaps sounding automatically at selected intervals. A valuable feature is a listening capability whereby the speaker can also act as a microphone to pick up distant sounds, aiding in two-way voice communications, or the early detection of sound-producing aids to navigation.

In selecting equipment, be sure to get a unit with adequate power, 25 to as much as 80 watts is desirable. The “P.A.” output from CB sets is only 2 to 4 watts; however, the “hailer” function on some VHF radios can be between 20 and 30 watts.

Proper installation is essential. A hailer requires adequate primary power wiring (a powerful hailer will draw 10 amps or more; check the voltage at the unit while using it). Adequate wiring from the unit to the speaker is also important. And perhaps most important is the proper location and mounting of the speaker (to disperse the sound in the desired direction and prevent feedback into the microphone). Note that despite what is seen on many craft, the proper mounting is with the longer axis of a rectangular speaker opening vertical, not horizontal; see Figure 3-27. An excellent feature of some installations is the mounting of the speaker either on the searchlight or on a similar mount that can be both trained in direction and elevated in a vertical plane. This permits the efficient use of the hailer to persons off to one side or a bridgetender high above the boat. The combination of a hailer that can pick up and amplify distant sounds with a trainable mount will permit “audio direction-finding” on fog signals to a surprising degree of precision—a real help in zero-visibility piloting situations.

Figure 20-15 An installed loud hailer is excellent for direct-voice communications over distances from tens of yards to a half mile or more. Some models will pick up incoming sounds to make two-way communications possible. When installed on a boat, the longer axis of the speaker’s horn, shown here horizontally, should be vertical.

### Intercom Systems

While most people think of a boat as being too small and too compact to have internal communications problems, there are numerous applications for simple intercom systems. The interior of many larger cruisers, particularly those of the double-cabin type, are so divided that voices do not carry well from one compartment to another. A simple three-station intercom system connecting the bridge, after cabin, and forward cabin or galley can facilitate conversation between these locations and save many steps. On a boat with a small crew, such as a couple living on board by themselves, a quick and reliable communications system is truly a safety item, and the helmsman need not leave his position or divert his attention to carry on a conversation or summon assistance.

Many VHF radios can provide intercom functions with two or more remote stations and may allow full control of the radio from the remote unit. Some are available as wireless microphone/intercoms. Wireless telephone systems that can connect to cell phones can be used as intercoms. Wireless headsets with VOX (voice-operated transmit) are a popular option, especially when used by the foredeck crew while anchoring.

### Morse Code Communications

Contrary to what many contemporary skippers believe, Morse code and other forms of signaling have not been totally replaced by electronic voice and data communications. Although radiotelephony and radiotext transmissions predominate, especially in the recreational sector, there remains a place for radio communications (other than in ham radio) that employ Morse code, and for visual forms of signaling, such as the use of hoisted flags.

#### The International Morse Code

The use of Morse code offers a number of significant advantages in radio communications. Because an interrupted continuous wave (CW) signal does not require microphone or modulation circuits, the equipment necessary for successfully sending Morse code messages is simple, low-cost, and easy to build and maintain. Moreover, exceptionally low output power—as little as 2 or 3 watts—is often sufficient to transmit CW signals across open ocean to a range in the thousands of miles. And because an experienced radio operator can usually distinguish even a weak Morse code CW signal amid static and interfering transmissions, these signals can often get through in circumstances where both VHF/FM and SSB would likely fail.

Memorizing Morse code characters, shown in Figure 20-16, takes time, but it can be done by anyone. Once learned, if occasionally used, they will not be forgotten.

Figure 20-16 Morse code signaling is not frequently used, but it can be of great help in some situations. It can be used by sound and flashing light. Learning is not difficult if studied and practiced occasionally.

### Flag Signaling

There is an established international code of flag signals. One or more flags are hoisted aloft on a halyard where they can be seen by another vessel. The set of code flags—shown on this page—consists of one each of 26 alphabet flags, 10 numeral pennants, 3 substitutes (or repeaters), and an answering pennant (the Navy and Coast Guard use a fourth repeater). The substitutes are used when a given flag or pennant has already been used once in a hoist; flags and pennants are mixed in a hoist as required.

NGA Publication No 102, International Code of Signals provides sets of one- and two character signals for commonly used messages, plus signals of more characters for more complex communications (a revised edition in digital format is available in its entirety online). These are used with flag hoists and other methods of visual and sound signaling. For example, hoisting the alphabet flag ‘H’ means “I have a pilot on board.” The alphabet flags ‘N’ plus ‘C’ means, “I am in distress and require immediate assistance.”

Today, few yachts carry a full set of international code flags, but many carry one or more that have special uses; for instance, the yellow ‘Q’ flag that must be hoisted when entering, and requesting permission to use, a foreign port. Racing sailboats (and judging committee boats), however, regularly have recourse to flag signaling, and the sailing skipper who engages in racing needs to be fully familiar with the specialized signals involved; refer to this page for “International Flags & Pennants” and to this page for “Signaling Using Flags.”

### Flashing Light Signaling

Signaling by short and long flashes of light is much faster than flag signaling, and more information can be communicated. Moreover, because light signals can be narrowly aimed, they are less likely to be intercepted by other than the communicating vessels. Consequently, light signals are still used by naval vessels in some situations.

On board ships, light signaling is often accomplished by means of an Aldis light, a very bright, highly aimable light with a convenient trigger switch. However, light signaling can be accomplished with any form of light that is readily turned on and off, even a flashlight. If it is not feasible to turn the light off and on fast enough for signaling, a shutter can be operated close in front of the light to form short and long flashes. Therefore, there are circumstances in which light signaling can be advantageous to a small craft skipper.

Unfortunately, light signaling requires the ability to send and read Morse code—a rarity among recreational boaters. So it is unlikely to have application for most boat operators—unless perhaps one night he or she is aground, with a general failure of electrical power for radio communication and an urgent need to communicate with a Coast Guard rescue vessel or helicopter, in which case the ability to send light signals with a battery-powered flashlight could prove critical.

MARINE ENGINES

Gasoline and Diesel Inboard Engines • Pod Drives Inboard and Outboard Engine Maintenance

For optimal performance, utility, and safety, a boat’s propulsion package should match its type, size, and intended purpose. Small trailerable boats, for example, are typically powered by outboards or sterndrives, also called inboard-outboards and IOs. Center-console fishing boats are generally driven by outboards, while fishing boats with cabins use outboards or twin gasoline inboards up to roughly 40 feet and diesel inboards beyond that. Most ski boats use gasoline inboards, while trawlers and large motoryachts are almost always propelled by diesel inboards. Daysailers and small cruising sailboats of less than about 25 feet typically rely on an outboard with a long shaft, either affixed to a transom-mounted bracket or mounted in a cockpit well, while larger sailboats usually have a small inboard diesel.

As both fuel and boats have gotten more expensive, diesel engines have become more competitive with gasoline engines. New electronically controlled diesels are lighter, quieter, more powerful and fuel-efficient, and less polluting than engines of just a decade ago. At the same time, mandated pollution-control equipment such as electronic fuel injection and catalytic converters have made gasoline engines more expensive, reducing (but not eliminating) their cost advantage over diesels.

There are three main drive-system options for gasoline and diesel inboards, the most familiar of which employs a conventional straight drive shaft that runs aft from the engine and exits through the bottom of the hull at a descending angle. Outside the hull it is usually supported by an exterior strut mounted to the hull bottom. A propeller is fixed to the shaft end via two large locking nuts. Steering is accomplished by a rudder mounted behind the prop; the drive shaft itself, being fixed, can provide no steering ability. Reverse propulsion is accomplished by means of a marine transmission, which reverses the direction of drive shaft and propeller rotation.

A waterjet uses a powerful pump inside the boat that is connected to the engine by a short drive shaft. The pump impeller generates a stream of high-pressure water that exits the back of the boat through a steerable nozzle, providing steering ability as well as propulsion and thus eliminating the need for a rudder or rudders. When the operator calls for reverse propulsion power, an articulated diverter, commonly called a “bucket,” deploys into the high-pressure stream, essentially reversing its direction. Without rudders and external struts, shafts, and propellers, jet-drive boats experience much less drag than boats with conventional drives, and they can have shallower draft. They will not foul lobster pots and other fishing gear, and they are safer to operate around swimmers. Jet-drive boats are discussed in Chapter 7, this page.

A sterndrive has the engine inside the boat and the outdrive, a steerable component containing the propeller, mounted on the outside of the transom. In a conventional twin-sterndrive application—as discussed in Chapter 7—both outdrives move in unison, but new microprocessor-controlled systems allow each drive to operate independently; a helm-mounted joystick sends inputs to the microprocessor, giving the helmsman what is basically “point-and-shoot” operation.

Joystick operation is available for larger boats, too, thanks to pod drives—Volvo Penta’s IPS and Cummins’s Zeus—which feature independently controlled propeller pods mounted aft on the bottom of the hull and a microprocessor that reacts to movement of the wheel or joystick. For more information on pod drives, see this page. Joystick controls for conventional straight drive systems with electric thrusters are available from Cummins, ZF Marine, and Twin Disc.

Outboard and sterndrive engine selection and operation are discussed in Chapter 7, beginning on this page. Among other topics, Chapter 7 considers outboard versus sterndrive engines for small boats, two-stroke versus four-stroke outboards, and the uses of small electric trolling motors. Also discussed there are propeller design and materials, outboard-engine fuels and fueling, and outboard engine controls and adjustments.

In this chapter we discuss gasoline and diesel inboard engines for boats roughly 25 feet and larger, and then present common troubleshooting and maintenance procedures for all engines.

Figure 21-03 Outboard-driven boats are commonly smaller than inboard-engine boats, but not always. Three 350-hp outboards can get this big center-console boat out to the best fishing grounds in a hurry.

Right: MerCruiser’s Axius system joystick operates two sterndrives independently via computer control. The system responds both to the direction you move the joystick and the pressure you apply. For comparisons of outboard and sterndrive engines, and for information on handling outboard- and sterndrive-powered boats, see Chapter 7.

Figure 21-06 A two-shaft marine transmission. In forward gear, the input shaft (from the engine crankshaft) engages directly with the output shaft. In reverse gear, however, the input torque is transferred to the output shaft indirectly via an intermediate gear, which reverses the output shaft rotation.

A good crew, calm day, and open dock make docking a pleasure. An auxiliary sailboat of this size might be powered by a 30- to 50-hp diesel. The powerboat at the dock is a Sabre 42 flybridge cruiser with twin diesel engines (Cummins QSB 425 hp) powering Zeus pod drives (see sidebar, this page).

## GASOLINE & DIESEL INBOARD ENGINES

Gasoline inboard engines are typically automotive engines that have been “marinized”; that is, they have been equipped with cooling systems and water-jacketed exhaust manifolds that use the water surrounding the boat to remove heat. Operationally they are basically identical to car engines, but instead of being connected to a multi-speed transmission, they mount to a marine transmission, or marine gear, which has only forward, neutral, and reverse and a fixed reduction ratio. A marine gear has an internal oil pump powered off the engine that uses hydraulic pressure to compress a series of internal clutches that in turn provide engagement (forward or reverse) and disengagement (neutral). A marine gear’s forward end typically mounts directly to the engine, and its aft end has an output flange that bolts to the propeller shaft, sterndrive, pod, or waterjet pump. The location of the engine or engines depends largely on the type of drive system.

Modern marine diesels may be either marinizations of industrial (usually truck) engines or engines designed from the start for boats, usually commercial vessels. Marine diesels use marine gears that are identical in design to those for gasoline engines but of much heavier construction.

One variation of the inboard is the V-drive, in which the engine is mounted backwards. A short drive shaft (“jackshaft”) leads from the marine gear on the front of the engine to the input end of the V-drive; the V-drive’s output end is pointed 180 degrees in the opposite direction so that the propeller shaft connecting to it passes under the engine. While the V-drive gear creates some frictional loss, this setup allows the engine to be mounted as much as four feet farther aft, saving space, and with the weight of the engine and running gear farther aft, the boat usually gets on plane easier. V-drives are most often used in cruising boats because of the extra interior space they produce. They are usually unsuitable for fishing boats, as the engines and gears occupy space that would normally be taken up by bait wells and fish boxes.

In a typical inboard installation—whether straight-shaft or V-drive—the shaft and prop are fixed; they can’t be turned to steer the boat. These inboard boats need rudders for steerage, and they, along with shafts and struts, produce considerable underwater drag. Such drag is reduced in sterndrives, waterjets, and pod drives.

Figure 21-08 Two views of a Twin Disc V-drive marine transmission.

Figure 21-09 This Sabre 38 Salon Express, a 2017 model with a modified-V planing hull (17 degrees of deadrise at the transom), is powered by twin 300-horsepower Volvo Penta D4 diesels linked to IPS pod drives that require no struts or exposed shaft. The boat’s top speed is 30 knots (3,500 rpm; 30 gallons of fuel per hour), and it cruises at 23 knots (3,000 rpm; 20 gallons of fuel per hour).

## GASOLINE OR DIESEL?

Gasoline inboard engines are lighter and less expensive to purchase and maintain than diesels of comparable power, and while they burn about a third more fuel per horsepower, they typically produce faster acceleration. However, diesels can be safely run continuously at 80 to 90 percent of full throttle, while gasoline engines should be run at around 65 percent. Consequently, diesels usually produce equivalent or higher cruising speeds. Diesels also produce more torque—the twisting force that drives the propeller—at lower speeds, so they are better for heavy boats.

For a variety of reasons—including the use of heavier materials, the fact that their fuel is actually oil and so lubricates as it provides power, and that they run at slower speeds than gasoline engines—diesels typically have a longer life—three or four times as long—between rebuilds. Still, the life of a well-maintained gasoline inboard engine is measured in thousands of hours of operation, and the costs of standard annual maintenance are less than for a diesel because, for a typical oil change, the diesel requires three or four times as much oil and has more, and more expensive, filters. Traditionally, diesel engines enjoyed the advantage of not requiring tune-ups as gasoline engines did, but modern electronic gasoline engines no longer require frequent tune-ups. Diesels are typically more reliable than gasoline engines (although new gasoline models are closing the gap), mainly because they do not have the electrical system necessary to produce a spark to initiate ignition. Finally, since gasoline is highly volatile, it produces fumes that can explode. Under normal circumstances diesel fuel produces no explosive vapors and will burn only if exposed to a flame or, when atomized, to a spark; it is highly unlikely to explode. That’s why it’s so important to run the bilge blower of a gasoline-powered boat before starting the engines. (Not a bad idea for diesels too, just to be safe.)

### Inboard-Engine Cooling Systems

In gasoline and diesel engines—as in car and truck engines—the cylinders are surrounded by spaces in which coolant—in most cases a 50/50 mix of fresh water (distilled is better) and antifreeze—is circulated in a closed loop by an engine-mounted pump. In a car or truck, heat is removed from coolant by passing it through a water-to-air heat exchanger—a radiator. Basically the coolant passes through small tubes over which air passes as the vehicle moves. In boats, heat is removed from coolant by a water-to-water heat exchanger; this can be in the form of an internal heat exchanger through which raw water is circulated or a keel cooler, which is basically piping mounted to the outside of the hull underbody. Keel coolers are often preferred by long-range cruising boats because of their simplicity and reduced likelihood of corrosion, but they add underwater drag (not an important factor in a slow displacement boat) and can snag lines or debris.

In the case of an internal heat exchanger, the coolant circulates through small tubes, as in an automobile, but is exposed to water drawn in from outside the boat rather than to flowing air. To do this, a marine engine requires a second pump—a raw-water pump—to pull water from outside the boat and force it through the heat exchanger and back out of the boat. This pump contains a flexible multi-vaned rubber impeller that is susceptible to damage from water-borne debris and wear, so before the water reaches the pump, it passes through a strainer mounted either inside or outside the boat that removes foreign material that could not only damage the impeller but also clog tiny heat-exchanger passages.

Once the water leaves the internal heat exchanger, it is injected into the exhaust manifold, usually at its highest point, where it combines with exhaust gases, cooling them to a safe temperature, and then is pushed through the muffler and out the exhaust outlet. (A boat equipped with a keel cooler will have a separate raw-water system to do this.) When you start your inboard engine, you should look at the exhaust outlet to make sure water is coming out; if it’s not, your raw-water pump is faulty, and if the engine continues to run, it will overheat. Similarly, if your engine temperature gauge begins to rise during operation, you should again check the water flow out of the exhaust(s) before doing anything else. If it is a mere trickle or has stopped altogether, look for an obstruction at the raw-water intake—a plastic bag or grass or seaweed—clogging the internal strainer. (Most strainers are made of clear glass, so you can check this visually.)

A few inboards and most outboards are “raw-water-cooled,” meaning they do not have a heat exchanger or recirculating fresh water. In inboards this can lead to internal corrosion if the boat is operated in salt water. This is not typically a problem with outboards because they are made of aluminum alloy, although many outboard manufacturers recommend freshwater flushing after use.

Figure 21-10 This 27-foot Ranger Tug has above-the-water styling reminiscent of a tugboat, but the resemblance ends at the waterline. The boat will reach 20-knot speeds with its single 180-hp Yanmar diesel and can cruise at 15 knots, and its 8½-foot beam and 6,200-pound unloaded displacement enable it to be trailered.

Figure 21-11 The Grand Banks 36 is meant for comfortable running at displacement speeds, so power can be modest. This boat’s twin 135-hp Ford Lehman diesels identify it as an older model, since Ford Lehmans have not been available for some years, although parts are readily available. Some Grand Banks 36’s are powered by single engines.

Figure 21-12 A sea strainer like this internal one, mounted between the raw-water intake and the raw-water pump, removes detritus that might otherwise damage the pump impeller or clog the heat-exchanger passages.

##### GASOLINE FUEL AND ETHANOL

Beginning around 2000, many states, and eventually the federal government, mandated that ethanol be mixed with gasoline to reduce emissions, boost octane, protect the environment, and help farmers. (Most ethanol is made from corn.) The federal government specified a mixture of 10 percent ethanol to 90 percent gasoline called E10. Since then most boat owners have used E10 without significant problems, though some say it has damaged their fuel tanks and fuel-system components (particularly those made of synthetic rubber) and even caused inboards and outboards to misfire, overheat, or shut down.

Besides being a fuel, ethanol is also a solvent that can loosen varnish and gum, and even rust, that has accumulated in fuel tanks, sending contaminants through the fuel system where they clog filters and carburetors or fuel injectors. Ethanol also degrades the epoxy and polyester resins that were used in many fiberglass tanks up until the early 1990s, causing them to soften and, at worst, leak fuel into the bilge. Tanks made with vinylester resins are not affected.

To make matters worse, ethanol is hygroscopic, meaning that it attracts water. The higher the humidity, the more water ethanol will pull put of the air. The resulting gasoline-water mixture forms layers in a process called phase separation—gasoline on top, water and ethanol on the bottom, which is where the fuel pickup is. Once water is drawn into the engine, it can reduce the lubrication efficiency of oil, causing increased wear and reducing engine life. Because it dilutes gasoline, water also results in poor performance.

Most boaters, even those with older boats, can mitigate or negate these effects by using a fuel stabilizer recommended by the engine manufacturer and by installing a fuel-water separator in the fuel line to remove water. If you suspect your boat is susceptible to ethanol-related contamination, change your fuel filter(s) often—every 50 to 100 hours—and keep spares on board in case one clogs while you’re underway. (You may need a 10-micron filter to trap all the sludge.) Periodically check all fuel system components that are susceptible—the rubber primer bulb, rubber fuel lines, fuel filter, fuel pump, hoses, gaskets, and tanks. Finally, keep your fuel tank full as much as possible and make sure the filler cap seals tightly to prevent condensation from forming inside the tank. When you store the boat for the off-season, either remove all fuel from the tank or fill it and add a fuel stabilizer.

E10 is not usually a problem for engines built after 1991, and today most engine manufacturers regard it as an acceptable fuel. In 2008, however, ethanol manufacturers asked the federal government to replace E10 with E15—15 percent ethanol and 85 percent gasoline. After some tests, engine manufacturers and the National Marine Manufacturers Association objected to the 50-percent increase, saying it would lead to overheating, piston deterioration, and even catastrophic failures. Test results released in late 2011 by the U.S. Department of Energy supported these claims. In 2009 the Environmental Protection Agency issued a waiver for E15, effectively allowing it into the fuel supply, but did not mandate E15 use. In August 2012, a U.S. Court of Appeals rejected a boating industry challenge to the EPA waiver. The NMMA has distributed warning labels to boat manufacturers across the U.S. in the hope that these would be placed on all new boats. The labels alert boaters to the potential dangers of E15 and warn against use of the fuel.

## DIESEL ENGINES

Diesel engines have been gaining popularity in recreational marine use over the past two or three decades as fuel and boat prices have increased. But they’ve been around since 1892, when Rudolph Diesel, a German engineer, patented an engine that used hot compressed air to ignite fine coal dust. (His previous attempt had blown up.) Today diesels are considered safer than gasoline engines because gasoline is much more volatile and flammable and because a diesel engine does not have a high-voltage electrical system that can create sparks.

The operation of a diesel engine is surprisingly simple. Fuel is injected into each cylinder via a nozzle, or injector, which turns it into a fine mist. Because a diesel engine has a much higher compression ratio than a gasoline engine, sufficient heat is generated by the piston compressing the air on its upstroke to ignite the fuel-air mixture without the aid of a spark plug. When the fuel injector sprays a very fine mist into the cylinder, the mixture ignites, expands, and drives the piston downward, turning the crankshaft. (The combustion process for a gasoline engine is similar except that in some older engines, a carburetor mixes the air and fuel, and since its compression ratio is only about 60 percent that of a diesel, a spark plug is required to ignite the mixture.)

#### Diesel Air & Fuel

Diesels need two things: large amounts of clean air and, because fuel injector passages are so tiny (in order to create that fine mist), very clean fuel. A typical mid-size diesel needs about 1,500 cubic feet of air per gallon of fuel. To make sure it’s free of contaminants, most modern diesels have a combination air filter/intake silencer with an element that must be periodically cleaned or replaced. As for fuel, all diesels are equipped with at least one engine-mounted fuel filter designed to remove particulate matter and small amounts of water. It should be replaced when the engine is serviced. (See your owner’s manual for specifics.) In addition, most diesel-powered boats today have a separate auxiliary fuel filter called a fuel-water separator that is mounted off the engine. It contains a fine-particulate filter element—typically one that can trap particles down to 10 microns—that also needs to be periodically replaced and internal vanes that spin the fuel like a centrifuge to separate heavier water from fuel. Water accumulates in a settling bowl (usually made of a clear material so you can see it) on the bottom of the separator. When it’s visible (it is a lighter color than fuel), it must be drained via a petcock on the bottom of the bowl. The principal advantage of a fuel-water separator is that it can handle much larger amounts of water than the engine-mounted filter before requiring servicing.

To help prevent water from getting into the diesel fuel in your boat’s tanks, make sure the fuel fill cap is snug and tight so that rain and wash-down water can’t drip into the tank. Check the cap’s gasket periodically, and replace it if it’s worn or cracked. If you see droplets of water on the underside of the cap, condensation may be forming inside the tank. Keeping your tank(s) as full as possible at all times will help minimize condensation. Whenever possible, buy your fuel from a reliable, reputable source so that it doesn’t already have moisture and contaminants in it when it comes aboard.

Water in diesel fuel—whether from poor-quality fuel or condensation—can cause misfiring in small amounts and outright stoppage in larger ones; it can also cause corrosion and the growth of an algae-like substance in fuel tanks, which can be very difficult (and costly) to remove. This material typically accumulates on the bottom of the tank and is stirred up when the fuel is agitated—as in rough seas. Even a top-quality fuel-water separator can handle only a small amount of this sludge before it becomes clogged and your engine stops. When that happens, you’ll need to replace the element in the fuel-water separator, which has prevented the sludge from reaching the engine-mounted filter(s). Unfortunately, replacing the element can be very difficult and messy in a seaway, and if there is a sizable accumulation of sludge in the tank, the new element will quickly clog and your engine will stop again.

One option worth considering is dual separators. The engine runs off one until it becomes contaminated, at which point, by throwing a lever, you can switch the engine to the other one without missing a beat. You can then change the dirty element on the off-line separator without stopping the engine. A second option, a vacuum gauge, can show at a glance when the filter element is getting clogged, so you won’t have to wait for the engine to lose power, surge, or miss before changing elements.

One problem you’ll face whenever you service your diesel’s fuel system is air being introduced into the fuel system. Any air will stop a diesel engine. It is most often introduced when someone changes a fuel filter and fails to top off the filter fully with clean fuel. Bleeding air out of a diesel’s fuel system is a complex, time-consuming process that often requires loosening a fitting so the air can escape. Procedures vary from engine to engine (check your engine manual), but regardless, this is not something you want to learn on the spot. Spending a few minutes reviewing the procedure at dockside will save you a lot of time and frustration when things go awry.

#### Common Diesel Engine Terms

Naturally aspirated A diesel engine that is not turbocharged. The amount of air entering the engine depends solely on the vacuum created by the downward-traveling pistons.

Turbocharged A diesel engine fitted with an air pump powered by exhaust gases that forces more air into the cylinders than natural aspiration would provide. This allows more fuel to be added, creating more horsepower.

Intercooler or aftercooler A radiator-like device between the turbocharger outlet and the engine air intake. Turbocharging compresses air, raising its temperature and making it less dense and thus reducing the benefits of turbo charging. An aftercooler or intercooler (they are basically identical) uses engine coolant to lower the intake air temperature, allowing more air into the engine and thus more fuel to be added, creating more horsepower.

Common-rail diesel A diesel in which all of the fuel injectors are connected via a single tube containing diesel fuel under extremely high pressure—around 30,000 pounds per square inch. This allows the use of electronically controlled fuel injectors with extremely small holes that create an ultra-fine mist of fuel, which burns faster and more completely.

With a traditional (non-common-rail) injector, there is often a lag time between when the pump generates injection pressure and the actual injection; in addition, the volume of fuel in the injection line at any given time is relatively small, particularly at lower loads. The common-rail system minimizes lag, leading to faster acceleration and better throttle response. It also is more efficient over the entire power range and produces less smoke, noise, and vibration. The downside is that it depends on very sophisticated electronics and, because of the high pressure involved, can be serviced only by trained mechanics.

##### POD DRIVES

Azipod drives have been used in commercial vessels such as cruise ships and tugboats—and even a few megayachts—for a long time, but have been installed in smaller pleasure craft only since 2004, when Volvo Penta introduced its IPS (Inboard Performance System). They quickly became popular for a variety of reasons. Each drive operates independently and can change propeller thrust through a wide arc (though less than 180 degrees), yielding much faster response to helm input than with a conventional inboard. Since the drives are controlled by a microprocessor, the system always positions the pods in the optimum position. If equipped with an optional joystick control, a helmsman need only point the boat where he wants it to go, and the boat will go there—even moving directly sideways—without the aid of bow and stern thrusters. IPS and Zeus, a competing system from Cummins that followed in short order, both use counterrotating propellers, which improve efficiency. The Zeus drive is now offered with Caterpillar engines, and the ZF drive with Yanmar engines.

An azipod drive system eliminates much of the running gear—the prop shafts, struts, and rudders—of a conventional drive system, thus reducing drag. Azipod propellers are mounted roughly parallel to the keel, not inclined as in an inboard. Thus, no thrust is wasted.

Finally, because the azipod relies on two 90-degree gear sets to transmit power to the propeller, it’s much more compact than an inboard using an angled drive shaft. An azipod system typically places the engines three feet farther aft, which frees up interior space and enhances planing. Azipods are also much easier for a manufacturer to install. There are no hydraulics or cabling; everything for the control system is contained in a wiring harness. Moreover, the exhaust system is typically internal to the drive and doesn’t require a separate installation, and there is no need for aligning a prop shaft.

An underwater look at aft-facing Zeus pod drives mounted in shallow tunnels to reduce draft. Note the seal next to the hull so that the drive leg will break away in case of a catastrophic grounding.

The Volvo Penta IPS drive is notable for its forward-facing, counter-rotating twin prop sets, as well as for its large seals to keep water from entering the engine room if the drive is damaged or torn away.

Pods are usually used in multiple-engine installations, principally in boats 35 feet long and longer. Most pods are driven by diesel engines, though Volvo Penta also offers gasoline-driven pods.

The lower portion of an azipod is designed to shear off when striking an object, leaving most of the upper unit intact so that watertight integrity is not compromised.

IPS uses two forward-facing counter-rotating propellers, a design Volvo claims exposes the propellers to clean, undisturbed water. Thus IPS is a tractor drive, pulling the boat through the water. Zeus also uses counter-rotating propellers, but they face aft and push the boat in a more conventional fashion.

In addition to joystick handling around docks, pods also offer greater maneuverability at speed because they change the direction of thrust instead of sending it directly aft to be deflected off a rudder blade. Because the control system is electronic, steering ratios and helm feedback can be adjusted to suit a particular installation. Azipod props are typically smaller than the props in an equivalent straight-shaft drive because there are twice as many props and blades; a smaller prop usually means less drag and often a shallower draft.

Though initially designed mainly for twin-engine installations, pods have been used in triple- or even quadruple-engine applications on large yachts. ZF Marine has developed a single-engine pod drive for use on smaller boats. Azipod systems can also be integrated with a separate GPS to allow automated station holding, something that is particularly valuable when waiting for a bridge to open or for a berth at a busy fuel dock.

But for all their sophistication, azipod systems do have drawbacks. They are significantly more costly and more complex than a conventional straight-shaft inboard drive system, which is simple, durable, and about as foolproof as anything on a boat can be.

## ENGINE MAINTENANCE

Marine engines of all types manufactured in the last decade require much less maintenance than older engines. This is due mainly to electronic engine controls that have been mandated as part of pollution-control regulations. In gasoline engines, such troublesome components as the carburetor, ignition points, and condenser are gone, and even spark plugs now last much longer. And because all marine engines—gasoline and diesel—enjoy much more complete combustion than in the past, engine oil life has been extended.

All this is good news, but it’s wise to remember that marine engines operate under much heavier loads than automotive engines, and this added strain makes even the reduced maintenance requirements of the newest engines critical. Also, the possibility of encountering contaminated fuel—especially water in diesel—adds to the importance of timely maintenance.

There are only three main types of marine engines—gasoline inboard, gasoline outboard, and diesel inboard—but there are many recommended maintenance routines. This is because the age of an engine (among other factors) influences its particular maintenance regimen. That’s why it’s always wise to rely on the documentation that came with your engine and/or the engine manufacturer’s recommendations.

### Inboard Engine Maintenance

Most of the following procedures are common to all inboard engines, gasoline and diesel. Steps that are specific to either gas or diesel are noted as they apply.

#### Daily Checks

Proper maintenance of any inboard engine starts each time you step aboard and before you head out. Performing a few daily checks will allow you to catch any minor problems before they become major ones. Key procedures include:

• Open the engine compartment or engine room and check for the odor of fuel. If you smell it, don’t do anything else until you find its source.

• Make sure the raw-water intake seacock is open. (Closing it each time you leave the boat will prevent problems associated with a leaking hose or broken hose clamp.)

• Check the engine oil level.

• Check the coolant level. Don’t just look at the plastic expansion bottle on the bulkhead; remove the pressure cap on the engine and dip your finger into the tank. If it comes up dry, add a 50-50 mixture of coolant and water until you can just wet the end of your finger. (Never remove the pressure cap when the engine is heated.)

• Inspect all belts for looseness or wear. If you can deflect a belt more than a half-inch, it probably needs tightening.

• Check the bilges for water or oil. If you see either, find the source.

• Check hoses for leaks or cracks. Squeeze them; they should be firm. If they’re soft, they should be replaced.

• Check hose clamps for rust and for looseness with a screwdriver. (All hose connections below the waterline should be double-clamped.)

• If you have a diesel engine with a fuel-water separator, check the clear bowl on the bottom for water. (It will be lighter than the amber diesel fuel.)

• Check your battery connection. Cable connections should be tight and free of corrosion.

#### Operation

Modern marine engines do not need to be warmed up. Start your engines and let them idle as you remove lines. (Do not gun the engines when you start them.) Unless you have a very short passage to open water, normal slow-speed harbor operation will be enough to sufficiently warm the engines. When you are ready to increase speed, advance the throttles slowly until you reach cruising speed. When you return, there is no need to cool down your engines. Normal idle speed back to the dock will be sufficient. Idling your boat for an extended period at dockside not only wastes fuel and produces pollution, it’s bad for the engines. All internal combustion engines operate most efficiently when under load.

#### Basic Maintenance

Again, the best source of service information is your engine manual. That said, here are some general guidelines:

• Replace spark plugs annually (gasoline only).

• Change the oil and oil filter every 100 hours (or as recommended in your engine manual) and prior to winter layup.

• Change the fuel filter annually (gasoline only). Diesel fuel filters should be changed at the same time as oil filters.

• Change the transmission oil annually.

• Clean the air intake filter/silencer annually.

• Replace the coolant every three years or 300 hours.

• Check all sacrificial anodes (zincs) every six months, and replace any that are more than half gone. Don’t forget the ones on the transmission oil cooler.

• If your gasoline engine is equipped with a distributor rotor and cap, ignition points, and condenser, replace these annually.

• Check the engine mounts for loose bolts and corrosion.

• For sterndrives, check the lower-unit oil. Make sure the level is correct, and look for cloudiness, a sign of water intrusion.

• For inboards, check the stuffing box/shaft log. On older boats, it should drip about once every minute; on newer boats with dripless shaft logs, it should be dry.

• When the boat is out of the water, shake the prop shaft at the strut to make sure it’s tight. Inspect the prop at the same time. If it’s dinged, remove it and have a prop shop refurbish it.

• Check the operation of all bilge pumps and float switches periodically.

• There are two schools of thought regarding raw-water impellers. One points to the fact that impellers are difficult to install correctly and that many water-pump failures stem from improper installations. This school’s conclusion is that if no problem is apparent, you should leave the water pump alone. The other school advocates preventive maintenance, urging annual replacement of impellers as a prophylactic. In truth, impellers often last many years if the raw-water strainer is properly serviced.

#### Troubleshooting

Every make of engine requires specific troubleshooting methods, but here again some general guidelines can be helpful. The most likely problem with a gasoline engine is with the ignition system, followed by overheating. With a diesel, dirty fuel or fuel starvation is typically the culprit, following by overheating. If you have twin engines—gas or diesel—and both quit at the same time, contaminated fuel (assuming you have not simply run out of fuel!) is the likely cause.

Regardless of what kind of engine you have, the number-one rule of troubleshooting is to do the simplest thing first. When your engine suddenly dies, it’s human nature to think in catastrophic terms, but before you haul out that set of wrenches you’ve never used, look at a few basics. Is the ignition key all the way on? Are the breakers on and untripped? Are the fuel valves and seacocks open? Do you have fuel? Are the fuel valves open? A few minutes examining the basics will often solve the problem, costing you little more than embarrassment.

Another cardinal rule is never to try more than one fix at a time. Your objective is not only to restore normal operation but also to learn the cause of the problem so that it can be avoided in the future. If you try two or more fixes before successfully starting the engine, you will not know which fix made the difference and therefore what the exact nature of the problem was.

Overheating If an engine overheats, check first to see if water is coming out of the exhaust. If it is, your problem is likely internal to the engine—a faulty thermostat perhaps—and you’re unlikely to be able to fix it immediately. If little or no water is coming out of the exhaust (and the raw-water seacock is all the way open), check the strainer. On some inboard boats the strainer is external, but on most it’s internal and probably has a clear housing, so you can see if there is debris inside. (Outboard and sterndrive engines pull their raw water from the lower unit; just tilt it up and examine the intake port on the sides of the drive.) If the strainer is clear, the likely culprit is a faulty raw-water pump—specifically the impeller, which is hard to change underway.

Misfiring This is the most maddening symptom for a boater because there are so many potential causes. In a gasoline engine, it’s often related to the ignition system, and any of the system components may be at fault. Fuel contaminated by water or (more likely) particulates is another possibility for gasoline engines. Generally speaking, newer electronic gasoline engines are more likely to misfire in response to bad fuel, whereas older, non-electronic engines are more likely to misfire due to faulty ignition components.

In diesels, misfiring is usually caused by one or more faulty injectors. (Fuel contamination usually results in surging, at least initially.) Determining which injector is the culprit and changing it is a job for a trained mechanic. Unfortunately, there’s not much the average boater can do other than limp home.

Sudden loss of power and/or engine speed The cause here can be internal or external. Your propeller may have picked up a line. If you have an outboard or sterndrive engine, stop the engine and trim the drive up and out of the water for inspection. If you have an inboard, you may have to don a mask and fins (necessary items aboard, along with a sharp knife) and take a look.

Surging Generally, this means fuel starvation due to a clogged fuel filter. If you have an auxiliary filter like a Racor, it’s relatively easy to stop the engine and check it. (Note that particulates will not show up in the clear bowl; you’ll have to remove and examine the filter cartridge on top.) If you don’t have an auxiliary filter, your only option is to remove the fuel filter and try to examine it visually, or just replace it, remembering to prime it correctly. Clear bowls are not allowed in gasoline fuel systems, but you can remove the filter element for examination.

Outright stoppage A sudden stoppage not preceded by misfiring or other symptoms is a bad sign. In a gasoline engine, it can be related to an ignition problem. Electronically controlled gas engines have a “limp home” feature designed to preclude outright stoppage. If your electronic engine quits suddenly, it’s probably serious, and there’s little you can do other than look for loose wires—including battery cables. If your engine is not electronic, your search will likely focus on the distributor and its internal parts: the rotor, points, and condenser.

Diesels very rarely quit suddenly; stoppage is almost always preceded by misfiring or surging. If your diesel does quit suddenly, it’s often because an electrical malfunction has closed the fuel solenoid, thus preventing fuel from flowing to the engine. The most likely cause is a tripped circuit breaker or broken connection.

#### Winterizing an Engine

The following steps apply to all inboard engines unless otherwise noted:

• Drain the water from the raw-water system, including the strainer, pump, and all hoses.

• Make sure the engine coolant offers proper antifreeze protection. Coolant does degrade over time. If you’re unsure, drain the system and refill with new coolant.

• Drain the water heater of fresh water.

• Lubricate all seacocks if possible.

• Fill the fuel tanks to ⅞ths full to reduce condensation, and add an appropriate fuel stabilizer. Run the engine long enough to fully circulate the treated fuel.

• Start the engine and let it warm. Then shut it down and drain the oil. Fill with fresh oil, replace the oil filters, and run the engine briefly to circulate the oil.

• Change the transmission oil when it’s warm.

• Seal all openings into the engine compartment—the air intakes, exhaust, and fuel-tank vent.

• Remove the batteries if practical and store them in a warm, dry place. Charge them regularly.

• Change the oil in the lower unit of a sterndrive engine and grease any fittings.

• Check the prop(s) for dings. Remove and send it out for refurbishing if necessary.

#### Recommisioning after Winter Layup

• Do a thorough check for signs of leakage or seepage at engine joints. Check for fluid in the bilges, and if any is found, determine the source.

• If you’ve removed the battery, bring it up to a full charge and brighten both terminals and both cable ends. Reinstall.

• Reconnect any hoses you disconnected at layup, such as those to the water heater. (If you made a checklist at layup, you can simply reverse the steps at spring launch.)

• Check all fluids, noting the levels and looking for discoloration due to the presence of moisture.

• Check the condition of the engine coolant using an inexpensive coolant tester, available at any auto parts store for under $10.

• Start the engine and let it idle for two minutes. Do not rev the engine.

• With the boat still tied to the dock, put the engine in gear for another two minutes, listening for any unusual sounds.

• After your first trip of the season, check all fluid levels and the bilges for signs of leakage.

#### How to Change Engine Oil

1. Make sure the oil is warm; it need not be hot. Run the engine if necessary.

2. Remove the drain plug if possible. Most engines require the attachment of a manual or electric pump to vacuum out the oil, as the drain plug is on the bottom of the oil pan and inaccessible.

3. While the oil is draining, remove the oil filter. You will probably need a filter wrench, and you may want to put a plastic bag around the filter to prevent oil from dripping into the bilge. In any case, it’s a good idea to always keep an absorbent pad under each engine to catch any fluid drips and keep them out of the surrounding water. Empty the oil from the filter into the same container that receives your used crankcase oil. Dispose of both properly.

4. Place a light coat of clean oil onto the new filter’s rubber gasket and screw it into place. Hand-tighten firmly, but do not use a filter wrench.

5. Refill the crankcase with fresh oil to the full mark on the dipstick.

6. Start the engine, run until the oil is warm, and check for leaks. After you shut down the engine and let it sit for a few minutes, check the oil level on the dipstick to make sure it is still at the full mark. Add more oil if necessary.

### Outboard Engine Maintenance

There are three main types of outboards, and which one you have will determine what maintenance you should perform:

• Most four-stroke cycle (or more commonly just “four-stroke”) outboards require basically the same maintenance as gasoline inboards, including an annual oil and filter change and a periodic (usually every three years) change of spark plugs. You may also need to change a fuel filter. All four-stroke outboards are electronically fuel injected, so they have no distributor. However, some sophisticated models such as Mercury’s Verado require specialized maintenance more often, which can be performed only by a trained technician. Most four-stroke outboards have at least two lubrication points and one to three sacrificial zinc anodes that need to be monitored and occasionally changed.

• Conventional two-stroke cycle (or just “two-stroke”) outboards have not been manufactured for at least 10 years due to more stringent federal and state emissions regulations. Because they burn a combination of oil and gasoline, they have no separate lubrication system and thus do not require periodic oil changes. Burning this mixture makes their spark plugs more susceptible to fouling than four-stroke engines, so periodic—sometimes more than just once a year—spark plug replacement is important. So is lubrication of key pivot points and zinc maintenance. Finally, older outboards lack the durable paint of today’s engines, so touching up scratches and abrasions is important to prevent corrosion.

• The third outboard engine type is the direct-injection outboard, notably the Evinrude E-Tec. It too uses a two-stroke combustion cycle and burns a combination of oil and gasoline, albeit via a much more sophisticated system. Sophisticated electronics and high-pressure direct injection allow it to meet all current emissions regulations. According to Evinrude, these engines need spark plug replacement only every three years or 300 hours. As with other outboards, however, there are other maintenance items that must be performed by the dealer.

When in doubt which procedures you should perform and when, consult your owner’s manual. But regardless of which kind of outboard you own, here are some tasks you can do yourself:

• Flush the engine’s internal passages with fresh water after use in salt water. All modern outboards have sophisticated internal corrosion technologies, but flushing out salty water can’t hurt. Many newer motors have easily accessible flush ports to make this job easier. If you don’t have a port, buy a set of “rabbit ear” muffler-type flexible rubber seals that fit over the water pick-ups on the lower unit. Attach them, connect a hose to a source of fresh water, and turn it on. Start the engine and let it run for two to three minutes.

• Like inboard engines, outboards have raw-water pumps in their lower units. The same divergence of opinion regarding inboard pumps noted above applies: either replace them annually and risk the chance of failure due to improper installation or wait until you see signs of deterioration (reduced water flow) before servicing them.

• Replace spark plugs as recommended by the manufacturer.

• Change the filter element in the auxiliary water/fuel separator once a year, if so equipped.

• Periodically remove the engine cowling and inspect the engine for leakage or corrosion. Check the integrity of the wiring, especially the spark plug wiring.

• Remove any dirt or salt residue with a damp rag and then wipe down the engine with another rag sprayed with a lightweight oil such as WD-40.

• Check the clamps on the fuel lines.

• Check the fuel primer bulb if so equipped. It should be free of cracks and firm when you squeeze it.

• Drain the oil from the lower unit and refill it. Observe its color; if it’s cloudy, that’s a sign of water intrusion and a failed propeller shaft seal.

• Install new sacrificial anodes on the lower unit once a year or as needed.

• Inspect the seals at the prop shaft, especially looking for monofilament line wrapped around the shaft. Look for signs of leaking oil.

• Look for bent or damaged propeller blades. If you see any, send the prop out for refurbishing.

• For winter layover, change the oil in the lower unit and grease any fittings.

• For winter layover, remove spark plugs and spray fogging oil into each cylinder of a two-stroke outboard. Replace the spark plugs.

• If you have a removable gas tank, remove it from the boat and store it in a warm, well-ventilated place for the winter, or drain it.

# CHAPTER22

INLAND BOATING

Piloting & Seamanship on Inland Waters—Rivers, Canals & Lakes The Proper Procedures for Using Locks

Boating on inland rivers, canals, and lakes is different in some respects from boating in coastal rivers, bays, and sounds. The differences are not total; many aspects of safe recreational boating are the same on all waters. But where differences do exist, they should be carefully considered.

#### The Pleasures of Inland Boating

Some of the finest cruising is found on the network of rivers and lakes giving access to areas far removed from tidal waters. Throughout the United States there are more than 30,000 miles (48,000 km) of waterways navigable by small boats. Using the Mississippi, the Great Lakes, the N.Y. State Canal System, and other waterways linking these with the Atlantic and Gulf Intracoastal Waterways, a boater can circumnavigate the entire eastern portion of the United States, a cruise of more than 5,000 miles (8,000 km). Only a small portion of this would be in the open sea, although the Great Lakes are, of course, sizable bodies of water, comparable to the ocean insofar as small craft cruising is concerned; see Figure 22-01.

Figure 22-01 The eastern part of the United States has an extensive network of inland waterways, including those that are natural, improved, or entirely man-made. On the Pacific Coast, there are the Sacramento and Colorado rivers, and throughout the nation there are many lakes and reservoirs that provide boating opportunities.

To these vast networks of interconnected waterways must be added the many navigable but isolated stretches of rivers and the thousands of lakes large enough for recreational boating. Many of these lakes have been formed behind dams in regions far removed from what is normally thought of as boating areas. Today, there are few places where one would be surprised to see a sign reading “Marina” or “Boating Supplies.”

#### Limitations

All cruising areas have their disadvantages and limitations. Some rivers and lakes may have shoals and rocks. Other rivers may have problems with overhead clearance; a fixed bridge might arbitrarily determine your “head of navigation.” It is imperative that you know your boat’s air draft—the height of the tallest item above the water surface—in various configurations, such as antenna(s) up and down, and especially the minimum you can achieve.

On some of the principal inland waterways, the overhead clearance is severely limited—on some sections of the N.Y. State Canal System it is only 15.5 feet (4.7 m). Boaters must unstep masts or fold down signal masts, radio antennas, and outriggers. Fixed overhead power cables are usually high enough to cause no problems to masted vessels, however, and their clearance is noted on charts. Unusually high water stages on rivers reduce overhead clearance by the amount of the rise over the “normal levels”; use extra caution at such times. Look for notes that explain what the clearances are based on; for instance, charts for the Ohio River give vertical clearance for high water based on 1936–67 levels.

Figure 22-02 Each waterway has at least a few of its own variations on the basic U.S. system of aids to navigation. Careful reading of chart notes, Light Lists, and Local Notices to Mariners is just as important for inland skippers as for coastal navigators. Visiting boaters should make a practice of seeking out local knowledge.

## RIVER BOATING

While rivers seldom offer vast open expanses where you will need the usual techniques of coastline piloting, they do require special piloting skills. Local lore often outweighs certain piloting principles that are the coastal skipper’s law, because a river’s ever-changing conditions put a premium on local knowledge; see Figure 22-03. River navigation is thus often more an art than a science.

Figure 22-03 The most often encountered hazards in river boating are shoals, sand bars, and submerged rocks. In man-made lakes, decaying trees and stumps may be present.

### River Piloting

The fundamental difference is, of course, the closeness of the shore, usually with easily identifiable landmarks or aids to navigation. Knowing where you are, therefore, is not a problem. The skill of piloting here lies in directing your boat to avoid hazards—on many rivers, this is not a simple matter; see Figure 22-04.

Figure 22-04 River piloting differs from that in coastal waters as one usually knows at all times exactly where he is. Navigation consists mainly of avoiding underwater hazards such as shoals, sand bars, and snags. Aids to navigation may be numbered in the usual manner (above). On Western Rivers, however, the dayboards may be unnumbered, with a separate sign indicating the distance in statute miles upriver from a designated point (see this page).

#### Water- Level Changes

Inland waters are termed nontidal, but that doesn’t mean they have no fluctuations in water level; see Figure 22-05. The variations are apt to be seasonal, such as spring freshets, loaded with debris, that flood down from the headwaters, overflow banks, and course rapidly on down to the sea. The annual changes in level can be astounding; at St. Louis the seasonal fluctuation in river level from winter-spring flood conditions to low level in late summer and fall may be as much as 50 feet (15 m). In smaller streams, sudden heavy rains may raise water level several feet (about a meter) or more in a matter of hours.

Figure 22-05 The Guntersville Yacht Club in Alabama uses floating piers to accommodate the seasonal fluctuation in water level.

#### River Currents

Broadly speaking, river currents, although they fluctuate in velocity, will always trend in one direction—from the headwaters to the mouth. Tidal rivers may nevertheless have strong tidal conditions at the mouth, which back the water up so that you can take advantage of a favorable current going upstream. On the Hudson, for example, an economy-minded skipper electing to run at 9 to 10 knots can time his trip to carry a favorable current all the way from New York City to Albany, 150 miles (241 km) inland. Tides at this latter city, even so far from the sea, may range to as much as 5 feet (1.5 m), although at other points far downstream the range will be only slightly more than half that amount.

Current Strengths The strength of river currents varies widely from river to river and from season to season for any particular river. Speeds on some sections of the Mississippi range from 1 to 6 mph (1.6 and 9.7 km/hr) under average conditions. At extreme high-water stages, current strengths may be much greater—9 mph (14.5 km/hr) or more in narrow and constricted areas.

River currents sometimes attain such speeds that navigation upstream is not feasible, although capably handled boats can be taken down safely. In the St. Lawrence River Galop Rapids, for instance, the current may run as fast as 13 mph (20.9 km/h). Some riverboats have power enough to ascend certain rapids, but as a general rule rapids are best avoided in favor of the canals and locks that bypass them, unless the skipper has local knowledge or engages the service of a local pilot; see also “Locks & Dams,” this page.

“Selecting” Your Current River current characteristics are of the utmost importance to the masters of deep-draft commercial vessels. The surface current acting on a small boat may actually be contrary to that which grips a large ship’s keel near the river bottom. Even surface currents vary from bank to midstream. Friction of the bank and bottom slows the water. The commercial skipper—to whom fuel costs and time of run are especially important—knows this difference. He uses the strength of the midstream current for his run downstream, and on the way back upstream he runs as close to the bank as he safely can, even turning into small coves to take advantage of the countercurrents.

You may be less concerned with the economic factors that the professional pilot weighs so carefully, but you can profitably heed the same principles. You can cut running time and fuel costs by running courses that make the river’s current work for you, or minimize its adverse effect. A 12-mph boat in a 4-mph current is making good either 8 or 16 mph, depending on direction of travel—a significant effect! Even for a 20-mph craft, the difference between 16- and 24-mph speeds is 50 percent.

#### Channels at River Bends

As a river flows around a bend, it tends to carve out the outside of the curve and slow down around the inside, depositing silt, forming shoals and ultimately a sand bar out from the point around which it is turning. Man-made structures and unusual bottom contours may alter this tendency, but it generally means that river channels going around bends will shoal on one side and deepen on the other over time; see Figure 22-06.

Figure 22-06 By staying in mid-channel, this small boat avoids the shoals that tend to build up along the inside of river bends. A deep-draft vessel may need to follow the outside curve of the bend in order to make sure of sufficient depth.

Study a river chart that gives depth (NOS charts, for example) and note this river flow characteristic. Then when you are on a river whose charts do not give depths (charts of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers do not), you will have a better feeling for where to find deeper water. With this understanding of natural channels at bends you will be less likely to run straight courses from marker to marker, cutting corners and risking getting hung up on a bar.

The proper course at each end is, of course, a curved line roughly following the trend of the river as a whole. If there are no aids to navigation to guide you, keep about a quarter of the river’s width off the outside bank at a bend in the river.

On some river charts, even the markings showing the topography ashore give clues to the river itself. Contour lines crowded close together near shore indicate a cliff rising steeply from the bank, with a good chance of deep water close under the bluff. The cliff may also be a landmark to steer by; see Figure 22-07.

Figure 22-07 Generally, the outside edge of a river bend provides the deepest water. The contour of the riverbank is also an indication of the underwater contour, but experience and judgment are required for correct interpretation. Local knowledge is a valuable commodity for a visitor.

Channel Crossing Where a river bends in an “S” curve—a curve in one direction followed by a curve in the opposite direction—the straight section between the curves is termed a crossing. On major rivers, these are usually marked by ranges or directional lights. In some instances, such as at low-water stages, seasonal buoys may be added to mark the route of best water; these buoys may be found in pairs or singly; see below.

#### Aids to Navigation

The basic U.S. system of buoyage (see Chapter 14) is used on the Great Lakes. The larger inland rivers, those that are navigable from the sea, have aids to navigation maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard. Many of their lights, buoys, and daybeacons are like those discussed in Chapter 14, but a few are of special design for their “inland” purpose. Some rivers under state jurisdiction may still have aids to navigation conforming to the now-obsolete Uniform State Waterway Marking System, but most waterways have been converted to the system used in waters marked by the U.S. Coast Guard.

The “Right” and “Left” Banks of a River Designation of a river’s banks may at first be confusing. The color of aids on the Western Rivers System conforms to the “red-right-returning” principle. When descending (moving downstream) the navigation aids on the left descending bank will be red, those on the right descending bank will be green; see Figure 22-08.

Figure 22-08 Particular attention must be paid to the notion of the “right” and “left” banks of a river. The choice is not always intuitive but is fundamental to the coloring of aids to navigation.

On the New York State Canal System, however, when regulations refer to the “starboard” side of the canal, they mean the right side when entering from Waterford (near Albany). Thus the starboard side of the Champlain Canal is the east side; but on the Erie Canal westward, the starboard side is the north side. Check your charts.

Mileage Markers A “mile” on an inland waterway is a statute (land) mile, not a nautical mile. Fixed aids to navigation on many major rivers are marked with mileage signs showing the distance upriver from a specified reference point; see this page. It is always easy to get a “fix”—just relate the mileage on a daybeacon or light structure with the mileage figures on your chart. This mileage information identifies the aid, substituting for the arbitrary odd and even numbers used in coastal waters; it is also useful in calculating distance and speed.

Daymarks The Western Rivers Buoyage System uses passing daymarks—square green with green reflective borders on the right side (descending the river) or triangular red with red reflective borders on the left side. There are also crossing daymarks that are diamond-shaped, red or green as appropriate, with small reflective squares of the same color in each corner. These indicate that the channel is crossing from one bank to the other; see this page.

Daymarks still in use on some inland rivers consist of two white boards, on posts or trees on shore, in the form of a large “X.”

Lights Most lights on major rivers, such as the Mississippi, show through 360°—they are visible all around the horizon. Sometimes a beam projects in one direction only, however, or the intensity of an all-round light is increased in a certain direction by a special lens. The beam’s width varies with the locations; a narrower beam marks a more critical channel. Flashing lights on the right (proceeding downstream) side of the river show a single green or white flash; those on the left side show double red or white flashes.

Generally speaking, lights on the Western Rivers (see Chapter 4) are placed strategically at upper and lower ends of “crossings” as marks to steer by, with additional lights between as needed. Where there are no crossings, lights along the banks serve as passing lights—lights that mark specific points along the banks. Your chart will show how a specific light should be used.

Buoys The skipper who is familiar with the basic U.S. system of buoyage will have no difficulty with buoyage on rivers. Buoys generally follow the same basic principles: green can-type buoys on the left and red nun-type buoys on the right when proceeding upstream from seaward. On the Mississippi and its tributaries, many buoys are unnumbered.

Buoys on the Mississippi River carry reflectors similar to those used on shore aids—red on the channel’s right (when ascending—returning from the sea, as in “red, right, returning”—see this page) and green on those on the left side. Lighted buoys show a red light (double flash) if on the right side of a channel (ascending) and a green light (single flash) if on the left side; a few buoys on either side show a white flashing light in the same single or double flash pattern. Buoys marking wrecks at the side of a channel show a quick flashing light of the appropriate color.

Buoys marking channel junctions or obstructions that can be passed on either side are horizontally banded either green-over-red or red-over-green as in the IALA system. If lighted, they show a group (2 + 1) flashing light of the same color as the top band.

Ranges On some of our major rivers, like the Hudson and the Connecticut, where channels through flats are stabilized and maintained by dredging, ranges with conspicuous markers on shore will help you stay within narrow channel limits. If you align the front and rear markers properly, you can hold your course safely in mid-channel despite any offsetting forces of current or wind.

Buoys and daymarks used on the Western Rivers are illustrated along with those used on other waters on this page.

#### River Charts

River charts are commonly issued in the form of books, the pages covering successive short stretches of the river in strip form. A typical example is the bound volume published by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to cover the Mississippi River (Upper) from Cairo, Illinois to the Gulf of Mexico. The scale is 1:40,000 (1 inch = approximately 0.6 mile or 1 km). All depth information (with a few exceptions) and detailed positions of rocks, reefs, shoals, and ledges that are shown on coastal charts are omitted. In their place, the sailing line of the river is traced in blue tint with a blue arrow indicating the downstream direction, between black lines delineating the banks. Navigation lights are shown by a black dot with a flare, the color of which indicates the color of the light. The light symbol is labeled with the name of the light and its distance upstream from a reference point—in this case, AHP, “Above the Head of Passes.” The Head of Passes is the point not far above the mouth of the river where the river splits into separate channels (“passes”) leading through the delta into the Gulf. Mileages are given every five miles (statute), with small black circles at one-mile intervals. A list of maritime facilities and other features such as bridges (with clearance data) and utility crossings, along with mileages from AHP, are on the page before the chart on which they appear.

The Mississippi River (Lower) Navigational Chart Book was last updated in 2015. Its Upper Mississippi River counterpart was updated in 2011. See https://bookstore.gpo.gov/catalog/transportation-navigation/almanacs-navigation-guides/usace-navigational-charts for these and other ACE chartbooks.

River charts are usually on a polyconic projection (see this page), and elevations normally refer to a specified mean water level.

Variations in River Charts River charts from different sources, such as the Army Corps of Engineers or NOS, do not all use the same symbol and coloring scheme; see Figure 22-09. Before you use one, study it carefully—particularly its legend. This gives aids to navigation symbols, abbreviations, topographic and hydrographic information, and often illustrations of characteristics peculiar to that chart. The symbol for daymarks on charts of the Ohio River, for example, are unique to that waterway and may cause initial confusion to strangers unless carefully studied; see Figure 22-10.

Figure 22-09 This section of NOS Chart 14852 shows the boundary between Canada (on the right) and the United States. Depths are reference to the Great Lakes datum and will vary with changing lake levels.

Figure 22-10 On this Army Corps of Engineers chart of the Cumberland River, of Tennessee and Kentucky, locations of bulletin boards that show river stages are shown, as well as the reference point for gauge readings. Symbols for nun and can buoys differ from those used on NOS charts. These and other river chart symbols are shown in the legend at right, excerpted from the chart.

Upper and Lower Mississippi River charts show water in blue and man-made features in black; blue is used for the sailing line; the Western Rivers system of buoyage is used for aids to navigation.

The book of Illinois Waterway charts shows the main channel in white with shoal areas tinted blue; land areas are colored yellow.

A booklet of charts for Navigation Pools 25 and 26 of the Mississippi River shows hazard areas—depths under 6 feet (1.8 m)—in bright red shading, harbors or anchorage areas with an anchor symbol, and the availability of fuel, water, marine railways, launching ramps, and repair and docking facilities.

Charts in the New York State Canals book, NOS Chart 14786, resemble the coastal charts described in Chapter 15. Land areas are screened gold tint, channels 12 feet (3.7 m) deep or more are white, with lesser depths light blue and depth contour lines for 6 and 12 feet (1.8 and 3.7 m), and black lines delineating the banks. Buoy symbols have magenta discs if they are lighted. Aids to navigation are numbered, and scattered depth figures give the skipper a good idea as to whether he dare venture out of the channel to seek an anchorage or for any other reason. Rocks and wrecks are indicated with standard symbols from Chart No. 1; see this page. Arrows indicating current flow direction, used on many other inland charts, do not appear on those of New York inland waterways.

Missing from the typical river chart is the compass rose of coastal and offshore charts which enables the navigator to lay a compass course. Instead, river charts generally carry an arrow indicating true north. To make the best use of space on the printed sheet, North is rarely toward the top of the chart.

#### Publications

Charts can convey a great amount of information, and you should always use the most detailed and latest editions you can get. Yet for space reasons, these charts cannot show all you need to know. Valuable additional data is published in the form of books and pamphlets; see also Appendix A.

Since channels, water levels, and other conditions on the Mississippi, Ohio, and other major rivers are constantly changing, the river boater must keep posted on the latest information at all times. Army Engineer District and Division offices issue several regular publications about current conditions. These are variously termed Divisional Bulletins, Navigational Bulletins, Navigational Notices, Notices to Navigational Interests (weekly), and Special Notices to Navigation Interests (as required). These small publications show up-to-date river conditions, such as channel depths and widths, estimated current velocities, controlling bridge clearances for specified stretches of rivers, construction projects and other hazards, and facilities like marine railways and lifts. Many are posted online.

U.S. Coast Guard Notices The 8th Coast Guard District, with headquarters in New Orleans, issues a Local Notices to Mariners—Mississippi River Edition covering changes in aids to navigation, hazards, etc., for the Mississippi River System. The USCG also issues occasional Channel Reports noting the least depth found by Coast Guard cutters and buoy tenders on their river patrols.

Light List One of the most helpful documents to the river skipper is the U.S. Coast Guard’s Light List, Volume V, covering all of the Mississippi River System. It tabulates lights, buoys, and other aids to navigation and gives mileages (in statute miles) from a specified point. Aids are described in greater detail than chart symbols and abbreviations can provide; see Figure 22-11.

Figure 22-11 Information on the charts for the Mississippi River system, including the Illinois Waterway, is supplemented by the USCG Light List, Volume V, which provides more details than can be shown on the charts.

#### Navigation “Tools”

On most rivers—unlike other waters—there is usually no need to plot a course or bearing, so there is little use of a compass. Generally, a binocular will be used to sight from one navigational aid to the next. In fog, most recreational boat traffic comes to a near-standstill, although commercial vessels normally carry on with radar. This does not mean you can dispense with compasses on all inland rivers; some are wide enough that you can continue in fog using a compass, speed curve, watch or clock, and due caution. A chartplotter will be very useful.

#### Shoals & Dredging

Shoaling is a serious problem in most rivers, and dredging in many rivers is nearly continuous. Spring floods build up current velocities, stir up silt in river bottoms, wash away parts of riverbanks, and carry all this dirt downriver in suspension, to be deposited as mud flats and sand bars where the strength of the current lessens; these flats and bars become hazards to navigation.

The Connecticut River is a good example of the shoaling problem; its channels must be dredged to authorized depths each year, at great expense. In the Mississippi River, a jellied mass of muck called flocculation is deposited as sediment on the river bottom to a depth of 10 to 15 feet (3.0–4.6 m) each year. Deep-draft vessels will plow through it, and high-water stages of the river flush it out into the Gulf, so the Army Engineers do not bother to dredge it at low-water stages. Over the centuries, this is how the river’s delta has been built up.

Shoals or bars that build up at the mouth of a river or at the confluence of two rivers can cause a serious problem. Rough seas and difficult wave patterns can build up over such features when strong out-flowing currents are opposed by the wind.

#### “Eyeball” Piloting

Much of a river pilot’s success depends on his acquired skill of interpreting what he sees. For example, no single statement can be made about what certain surface conditions reveal about relative depths of water, although they do present clues within the context. On one hand, where there is a chop in the channel there may be areas of smoother water over the bars, especially if there is any weed growth present. On the other hand, there may be wind-current conditions where the channel will be comparatively smoother, with ripples revealing the bars. The experienced pilot will know which condition prevails.

In some narrower river channels, with wind against current, a small sea builds up in which the larger waves disclose the deeper water and grow smaller until there are no seas at the channel’s edge. Under any conditions, the experienced boater will quickly learn to take advantage of nature’s signs.

Watch Your Wake In unfamiliar waters, even your wake can give a clue to the safety of your course. As it rolls off into shallow water, its smooth undulations give way to a sharper formation, even cresting on the flats in miniature “breakers.” When the waves reach a shoal or a flooded area where submerged stumps are close to the surface, the difference will show. If your wake closes up toward your stern and appears short and peaked, sheer off fast away from the side of the channel where this telltale signal appears.

Practice Makes Perfect As you develop a sense of river piloting, you’ll become more conscious of the track you should make good over the bottom relative to shoals and the sides of channels. Where currents do occasionally flow diagonally across your course, you will allow for them instinctively and look astern frequently to help maintain that sense of position. Always know to which side you should turn if the water shoals.

#### Local Knowledge

Not even the best of charts and publications can tell all about a particular stretch of a river. Rivers are particularly prone to seasonal or irregular changes, and if you are new to a specific portion of a river, you should take every chance to ask experienced local people about hazards or recent changes.

### River Seamanship

Boaters on inland rivers are subject to many of the general requirements for safety and good seamanship covered in other chapters. They must also be prepared for the special conditions that relate to specific bodies of waters. For example, boat handling at piers, and on entering or leaving slips, may be complicated by swift river currents. Grounding hard on river shoals may be more troublesome than it is on tidewater, where the next rising tide will often free a boat without any other assistance.

#### River Cruising

Cruising can be exceptionally enjoyable on rivers but requires careful planning and execution. Problems of where to make fast or anchor for the night are a part of cruising in any waters. On rivers you can often find shelter from blows close at hand, yet you will encounter areas big enough to work up a sizable chop or even seas, especially when wind opposes current. You’ll also need protection from wakes and wash of passing river traffic, and you need to decide whether to seek the seclusion of quiet anchorages off the beaten track or the activity associated with towns and cities.

New marinas on many inland waters—the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, for example—have been a boon to river cruising. They offer a place to make fast for the night and easy access to fuel and supplies.

Safety Harbors and Landings Many rivers now provide safety harbors and landings for use in bad weather, mechanical difficulty, or other emergencies; their locations are shown on charts. Safety harbors are usually coves off the navigable channel. Direction boards on shore indicate the entrance, and cross boards mark the upper and lower limits.

Safety landings are areas where the banks have been cleared of stumps, boulders, snags, or other underwater hazards so that boats can safely come to shore, with upper and lower limits marked by direction boards. These signs are typically color-coded; for instance, on the Tennessee, white if a 9-foot (2.7 m) depth is available at all water stages, orange if this depth is not available at lower levels.

The New York State Barge Canal provides terminals at intervals along its route; these are only occasionally in use by commercial vessels, and are available to recreational craft at other times. The terminals are concrete with rather rough faces, so you will need fenders and fender boards.

To allow for the seasonal range in water levels (or stages), most Western River marinas and yacht clubs are afloat on strings of barges. At low-water stages, you may have a long climb up the riverbank to get to town.

#### Anchoring

Your chart will often reveal a likely place to anchor for the night. A widening of the river may offer you the chance to get out of the reach of traffic, or a small tributary or slough may invite exploration (enter with caution and check depths as you go), or the natural configuration of riverbanks and bars may provide a natural “harbor” with complete protection. Islands in midriver often leave a secondary channel for small boats on the side opposite that used by deeper-draft commercial vessels. When a river cuts a channel behind a section of bank, a towhead is formed. Sometimes these are filled in or dammed across at the upper end by river deposits, forming a natural protected harbor that can be entered from the lower end.

You may also be able to get your boat behind a pile dike—a structure designed to keep riverbanks from washing away. The dike juts into the river and, by tying up to one of the piles just inside the outer end on the downstream side, you will be protected from passing traffic as well as from floating debris.

Use Caution Outside Channels When entering sloughs between islands or between an island and the bank, beware of submerged wing dams at the upstream end. To be safe, enter and leave from the downstream end.

When anchoring on the larger rivers near a sandbar or island—or when beaching a small boat there to go ashore—it’s wise to pick the downstream rather than the upper end. If your anchor drags, or if you somehow get aground on the upstream end, the current will be pushing you harder ashore. Water at the downstream end is likely to be quieter, and the eddies that normally exist there may help to free you.

Sandy bars that are exposed at low water may be quite unstable. Be careful when using them for camping or swimming.

Check Characteristics of the Bottom The character of the bottom varies widely on inland waterways. Particularly in their lower reaches, river bottoms are often soft mud, so you should carry at least one broad-fluked anchor of a design that will dig down until it reaches a good holding. A grapnel anchor, with its spidery arms and flukes, would pull through mud and provide no holding power at all, but on a hard or rocky bottom it is likely to be a better choice than the other type.

When anchoring over rocky bottoms, or in areas full of snags and roots, it is best to rig a trip line, a light line from the anchor’s crown to a small buoy—an empty plastic bottle will do—at the surface. If the anchor snags and will not come free in a normal fashion, pick up the buoy and raise the anchor with the trip line, crown first; see this page.

Leave an anchor light burning all night if there is any chance of other vessels being underway nearby; if you are not sure whether you need an anchor light, be on the safe side and have one showing.

#### Making Fast to the Bank

In many areas, cruising boaters make fast to the river’s bank for a lunchtime break in the day’s journey, or even overnight. Be cautious when doing this. First, check that the depth is adequate and the area is free of underwater obstacles; approach the shore slowly. Avoid vertical banks that may be in a stage of active caving; exposed tree roots in the bank may be evidence of recent erosion. Avoid rock riprap along the banks; it can damage a boat’s bottom; see Figure 22-12.

Figure 22-12 This typical Mississippi River bank is riprapped with concrete to protect against erosion. Use care near such banks to avoid damage to your boat’s bottom.

Allowance for Water-Level Changes On inland rivers your docking lines generally need not allow for the tidal changes common on the coasts, except, of course, on tidal rivers. On nontidal waterways, however, there is always the chance of a change in level with hard thunderstorms or other heavy rainfalls. Dams may have sudden discharges, both scheduled and unscheduled, of large amounts of water—use extra caution when on the downstream side of a dam and obey all “Keep Out” signs. Observe the practices of local boats, and be guided accordingly.

Tying up to a barge or float that will itself rise or fall with a change in levels is advantageous. Here, you need simply to leave enough slack in lines to accommodate the wake of a passing vessel.

#### River Cruising Problems

Boaters who have cruised a given river may have conflicting reports of its hazards, or the absence of them. One may have made the cruise in the early spring, encountering high water, flood conditions, racing currents, and floating debris, while another made his trip in September or October with low-stage water levels and slower currents so that he encountered few if any obstacles, except perhaps more numerous shoals. At extreme flood conditions, as a rule, river navigation is not recommended without the services of an experienced pilot.

Eddies and “Whirlpools” On the Mississippi, “sand boils” may be caused by sand piling up on the riverbed. During flood stages these whirlpool-like disturbances can be so violent that they can throw a boat out of control. In more favorable months, they may be no worse than surface eddies—felt, but certainly of no danger to a boat.

Debris Floating and partially submerged debris, such as tree trunks and branches, are a hazard for small boats. Keep a sharp lookout in waters where they have been reported. Floating debris is usually at its worst in the spring months, when flood water levels have swept away downed trees and other materials from above the normal high-water line.

Off-Station Buoys Another hazard of river piloting at springtime high-water levels is that buoys can be moved from their charted positions, dragged by strong currents or floating debris.

Submerged Buoys River currents sometimes flow so fast that buoys are towed under and completely submerged, leaving only a V-shaped eddy on the surface to reveal their location. Sometimes the buoy’s top will be visible to a boat bound upstream, or the wake of a passing vessel will expose it momentarily. The surface eddy of a towed-under buoy always points upstream as its “wake” divides downstream around it. Avoid any surface disturbance like this; a submerged obstacle is likely lurking beneath.

Do not confuse the towed-under eddy with the condition of two currents converging at the downstream end of a middle bar. That condition may also show a V-shaped eddy, but pointing downstream.

Problems from Silt Some river boaters have reported underwater bearings ruined, engine jackets or heat exchangers filled with silt, and water pump impellers worn out at the end of a single river run. In all waters heavily laden with silt, you are wise to carry protection against it: raw water strainers, freshwater cooling systems, cutless-type underwater bearings, and pump impellers that can handle mud and sand.

Special Hazards Some rivers present special hazards. The Army Engineers caution against regarding the Mississippi with insufficient respect, as in the example above of eddies and “whirlpools.” The lower river is very large, with low-water widths of 2,500 feet (0.8 km) and high-water (bank-full) widths up to 9,000 feet (2.7 km). The bank-full stages generally occur between December and July, most frequently in March or April. Low-water stages occur in the fall months.

The Mississippi River’s Lake Pepin typifies the kind of exposed area that you may encounter. This “lake,” actually a broadening of the river proper, is 21 miles (33.8 km) long and up to 2.5 miles (4 km) wide; sizable seas can build up in such a body of water.

You can find many kinds of equipment at work along rivers, especially the larger ones. Hydraulic pipeline dredges may have lengths of floating pipeline you must avoid. Barges carrying bank-protection equipment may extend hundreds of feet out from shore, often in the swiftest part of the current. When passing any form of construction or maintenance equipment, keep well clear because of the hazard of being swept under it, and slow down to avoid damage from your wake. Regulations exist governing lights and day shapes for dredges and other “floating plants” working on river projects, and for the passing of such equipment by other vessels. Use your VHF radio to contact the working vessel and get permission to pass, and advice on how to do so safely.

Confusing Lights Special caution is required when running rivers at night, even those with numerous lighted aids to navigation. Shore lights may cause confusion; searchlights used by commercial traffic may blind you. Floating debris often cannot be seen at all.

#### Signals

Whistle signals for passing other vessels, or for use in conditions of restricted visibility and other special situations, are prescribed in the Inland Navigational Rules. Details are in Chapter 5.

With few exceptions, the signal for requesting a drawbridge opening is one prolonged blast followed by one short blast. Where there is more than one bridge in close proximity, signals must be given for each bridge separately; see this page. VHF radio communications are much preferable to whistle signals.

#### Passing Commercial Traffic

Most U.S. inland waterways handle considerable commercial traffic. Whether you are cruising or just out for the day, you must know how to handle your boat in close quarters with a large commercial vessel. At night, be especially watchful for the navigation lights of other vessels—if you see both the red and green sidelights, you are dead ahead and in danger. In a narrow channel, a big tug or tanker requires much of the available water. As she approaches, you’ll see a sizable bow wave built up ahead of her, and the water drawn away by suction to lower the level at her sides amidships. Give her as wide a berth as you possibly can, and be alert for violent motions of your boat as she passes.

Tugs with tows astern in narrow waterways present a real problem to approaching small boats. Fortunately, most of the river “towing” today is done by pushing scows and barges ahead of the tug; see Figure 22-13. This keeps the whole tow under better control as a single unit. Passing at a bend is more dangerous than on a straightaway, and sometimes must be avoided entirely; the tug and its barges cannot help but make a wide swing, and though there may be ample room to pass at the beginning of the turn, there may be none at all later. If small boats must pass at a bend, it is usually wiser for them to take the inside of the curve.

Figure 22-13 Under no circumstances should you compromise the maneuvering room available to river tows (a series of linked barges pushed by a powerful, deep-draft tug). Avoid passing them in river bends. Shown here is barge traffic on the Illinois River.

Jumbo Tows on the Mississippi Big rafts of Mississippi River barges bunched together in one vast tow may cover acres of water. You should never jeopardize their activities, regardless of right-of-way. Integrated tows may consist of a bowpiece, a group of square-ended barges, and a towboat (at the stern)—all lashed together in one streamlined unit 1,000 feet (305 m) or more in length. At night, the lights of the towboat may be more conspicuous than the sidelights on the tow far out ahead. To make barges more visible, the Inland Rules require that those pushed ahead must show a quick-flashing yellow light all the way forward on the centerline; watch carefully for such a light; see this page.

Give All Tows a Wide Berth On all rivers, you should give tows a wide berth. In particular, stay away from in front of tows; if you should lose power, the tow could probably never stop or steer clear in time. A commercial tow must maintain speed to be able to steer, and may at times need a half mile to come to a full stop.

When approaching a tow from astern intending to pass, watch out for sunken logs and other debris that may be stirred up from the bottom by the wash from the tug’s powerful propeller; these will be low in the water and difficult to see. Use caution in passing through the turbulence resulting from this wash. Pass by at as large a distance as possible to avoid being sucked toward the tug when you come abreast of its stern.

Small-boat whistle signals are usually inaudible at the noisy control station of large vessels some distance away. If you need to communicate, use VHF radio, Channel 13 or 16. (On the Mississippi below Baton Rouge, Channel 67 is used rather than 13.) A passing is often verbally described over the radio, saying “one-whistle” or “two-whistle” as if actual blasts were being sounded.

##### WATERWAYS INFORMATION

An overall source for U.S. waterway information is the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which provides recreation opportunities on more than 400 lakes and river segments in 43 states. Army Corps resources can be accessed from www.usace.army.mil, and Army Corps waterway charts can be downloaded from the U.S. Government Printing Office at https://bookstore.gpo.gov/catalog/transportation-navigation/almanacs-navigation-guides/usace-navigation-al-charts. An Army Corps map presenting an overall picture of U.S. waterways, Major Waterways and Ports of the United States, does not appear to be published any longer but is still available in old editions online. The same may be said of Army Corps color maps of smaller river regions showing details of interest to boaters—marinas, ramps, sanitary facilities, camping and picnic sites, as well as dams and locks. The series of Lakeside Recreation maps for each region of the U.S. was particularly useful but now, seemingly, available only in older editions. Maps of the Alabama River, Mobile River, and Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway are available from http://www.sam.usace.army.mil/Missions/Civil-Works/Navigation/Navigation-Charts/. Current information on waterway levels and hazards nationwide can be accessed from http://www.usace.army.mil/Locations.aspx.

The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) formerly published a series of brochures, River Basins of the United States. These include general maps of major rivers, along with information of historical, hydrographic, and geological interest. Though seemingly no longer published, back issues remain useful and fascinating.

In Canada, all but the smallest lakes and rivers are charted by the Canadian Hydrographic Service; the exceptions are covered by other agencies. The Canada Map Office publishes topographic maps showing water areas, but without depth information. The Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources publishes provincial Fishing Maps, which show water depths as well as other fishing-related details.

#### Watch Your Wake

Much inland boating is done on waterways that are quite narrow. Regulate your speed so that no destructive wake results; excessive wake can cause damage to other boats and to shore installations. Some wake is almost inevitable from motorboats, but it must not be destructive; keep your speed, and your wake, down when passing boats and shoreline facilities.

## CANAL BOATING

Before construction of dams and locks, many of our rivers were unnavigable. Water coursed down valleys at the land’s natural gradient, dropping hundreds of feet in not many miles, running too fast and encountering too many natural obstacles for safe navigation. To overcome such obstacles, engineers dam natural waterways at strategic spots to create a series of pools or levels that may be likened to a stairway. Good examples of how closely these can resemble an actual flight of stairs are at places like Waterford, N.Y., and Rideau Waterway at Ottawa, where vessels descend or ascend a series of locks in immediate succession. This section covers boating on completely man-made waterways, which might be termed “pure canals,” and on “canalized” natural rivers.

#### Water Levels

To a river pilot, the term pool stage indicates the height of water in a pool at any given time with reference to the datum for that pool. On many rivers, pool stages are posted on conspicuous bulletin boards along riverbanks so as to be easily read from passing vessels. Charts show the locations of these bulletin boards.

On the Ohio River, gauges at the locks of each dam show the depth of the pool impounded by the next dam downstream. For example, if the chart indicates a 12-foot gauge reading for a normal pool, a reading of 11.7 feet indicates that the next pool is 0.3 feet below normal elevation.

### Locks & Dams

Without locks, the dams on our inland waterways would restrict river cruising to the individual pools and would prevent through navigation except for boats light enough to be portaged—carried on land by hand or on vehicles—around the dams. Locks, in conjunction with the dams, permit boats to move from level to level. Locks vary in size, but since they almost invariably handle commercial traffic, their dimensions offer no restrictions to the movement of recreational boats. Most locks can accommodate several vessels at the same time; see Figure 22-14.

Figure 22-14 Locks have made water travel possible on many waterways with dams and otherwise unnavigable sections such as rapids. More than one boat at a time may be passed through a lock, sometimes in company with a larger vessel.

#### Principles of Locks & Locking

Locks are virtually watertight chambers with gates at each end, and usually with valves admitting water to them as required. When a vessel is to be locked upstream to a higher level, first all gates are closed and valves on the lock’s downstream side are opened to let the water run out to the lower level. Then the downstream gates are opened so that the vessel can enter the lock. The downstream gates are then closed and water flows into the lock from above through another set of valves until the chamber is full to the level of the upper pool, with the boat rising along with the water. The upstream gates are then opened, and the vessel resumes its course upstream. Locking a vessel down is the reverse of this process; see Figure 22-15.

Figure 22-15 This series of sketches shows the process of locking through for an upbound craft. With the water in the lock at the downriver level, A, the boat enters the lock. The downriver gates are closed and water enters the lock chamber, B. (Water is shown here entering from valves in sides of the lock; in many locks, there are no such valves and the upriver gates are opened just a bit to let water in.) At C, the water in the lock chamber has risen to the up-river level, the gates are opened, and the boat proceeds on its way.

Water is not pumped at river locks; the natural flow is utilized, which is why some canals limit the number of lockings each day during droughts or annual dry seasons.

#### Variations in Lock Design

There are various kinds of locks, all of which accomplish the same result. Gates may swing to the side or roll back; sometimes they lift vertically and boats go under them.

Smaller locks and those with a minimal water-level change may not have underwater valves; water is let in or out of the chamber by opening the gates just a crack at first, then gradually widening the opening as the levels begin to equalize.

On one section of the Trent-Severn Waterway in Canada, the remarkable lock at Peterborough, Ontario, is actually a hydraulic elevator in which two large water-filled chambers, containing vessels, counterbalance as they rise and fall to the upper and lower levels. At another location on the same waterway, an ingenious marine railway with a unique cradling device is used to carry boats up and down a steep grade and deposit them at the other end. Through passage on a waterway like the Trent-Severn is obviously limited to boats within the capacity of the railway, both as to length and weight.

#### Whistle Signals

Signals are prescribed for vessels approaching a lock, to be answered by the lockmaster. The signals vary in different areas, so familiarize yourself with the signals that apply to the waterway you are using. At many locks, VHF/FM radios are used for direct communications between vessels and the lockmaster.

On the Ohio River, vessels sound a long and a short blast on the whistle from a distance of not more than one mile from the lock. Approaching boats must wait for the lockmaster’s signal before entering.

Where locks are in pairs (designated as landward and riverward), the lockmaster on the Ohio may also use an air horn to give directions as follows: one long, enter landward lock; two longs, enter riverward lock; one short, leave landward lock; two shorts, leave riverward lock.

On the Mississippi, signs on the river face of the guide wall warn small boats not to pass a certain point until signaled by the lock tender. Boaters use a signal cord near this sign, if their own horns are not loud enough, to attract the attention of the lock attendant. Similar arrangements are found on the Okeechobee Waterway crossing Florida and elsewhere.

#### Signal Lights

Traffic signal lights at the Ohio locks resemble those you find on city streets—red, amber (or yellow), and green vertically arranged. Flashing red warns: “Do not enter, stand clear.” Flashing amber (or yellow) cautions: “Approach, but under full control.” Flashing green is the “Go ahead: all clear to enter.”

On the N.Y. State Canal System, a fixed green is the signal to enter; a fixed red requires the vessel to wait. Six flashes of a red or green light means “stay where you are and await further instructions.” If there are no signal lights showing, you must wait or make fast to the approach wall.

As with sound signals, VHF radio communications are often used to supplement light signals.

#### Precedence at Locks

The secretary of the army has established an order of priority for the users of locks controlled by the Corps of Engineers, as follows: (1) U.S. military vessels; (2) mail boats; (3) commercial passenger boats; (4) commercial tows; (5) commercial fishermen; (6) noncommercial boats.

In the descending order of precedence, the lockmaster also takes into account whether vessels of the same priority are arriving at landward or riverward locks (if locks are paired), and whether they are bound upstream or downstream.

Recreational boats may, at the direction of the lockmaster, be locked through with commercial vessels if a safe distance can be maintained between them and if the commercial vessels are not carrying petroleum products or other hazardous substances.

### Locking Procedures

The concrete walls of locks are often rough and dirty. Some older locks have metal-sheathed inside surfaces, but most are hard on small boats, so keep your fenders ready; see Figure 22-16. Ordinary cylindrical fenders pick up dirt and roll on the wall to smear your topsides. Instead, you should use fender boards consisting of a plank (generally 2 by 6 inches, several feet long) suspended horizontally outside the usual fenders hung vertically. They will normally work well amidships or where a boat’s sides are reasonably straight.

Figure 22-16 Adequate fendering is a must in using locks; the side walls are always fouled by growth since they are submerged much of the time. Fenders will become dirty, possibly to the extent that they can no longer be cleaned for regular use—use your oldest, or some substitute (see text).

Bags of hay can be used in the same way as cylindrical fenders, except on heavily flared bows and at the edge of the deck, where they flatten down and work fairly well. Auto tires wrapped in burlap would be ideal except that their use is illegal in most canals (if they came adrift they would sink and probably foul the lock’s valves or gates).

As you can’t be sure which side of the next lock you will be using, it’s wise to have duplicate fender systems for each side.

#### Entering & Leaving

Since moving quickly around the deck while watching upward is an easy way to slip and fall, make sure that all persons outside on deck are wearing life jackets before entering a lock.

It is very important to enter locks with enough speed to maintain good steerage, since there may be some turbulence from the valves or the propellers of large vessels, but not so much speed that you cannot stop quickly. Small boats may be rafted alongside larger vessels or as groups of two or more. This is entirely practicable if all skippers are cooperative and cautious; it is usually good strategy for smaller boats to enter the lock last.

Occasionally you will hear about boats being tossed about as water boils into the lock from open valves. Be alert for this possibility, but lock tenders on our inland waterways are almost always careful to control the rate of inflow to minimize any turbulence in the lock chamber, and you need not fear the locking process for this reason. With a light boat, however, use extra caution when locking through in company with large commercial vessels. A boat directly astern of a tug, for example, can be tossed around when the tug leaves and its big propeller starts to kick out its wash astern.

#### Approaching a Lock from Upstream

Be cautious when approaching a lock from the upstream side; follow the marked channel closely. There are stories on every waterway of boats missing the upstream lock entrance and going over the adjacent dam. Looking down a river from above a dam, it is sometimes virtually impossible to see any break in the water’s surface, especially at night. Yet there is virtually no chance for such an accident if a skipper pays close attention to the buoys as on his chart, or to the general configuration of the dam and locks if there are no buoys.

Actually, there are some circumstances where it is proper to go over a dam. The Ohio River has a special type of dam that has a lock chamber on one side and bear traps on the other. Between them, there are movable wickets that can be held in an upright position during low-water stages and lowered at times of high water. When the wickets are up, vessels use the lock. With the wickets down at high water, vessels run through the navigable pass, right over the submerged dam, without locking. By day, it is important to watch the bulletin boards at the locks to know whether the lock or pass is to be used. At night, control lights are shown at the guide walls. When the navigable pass is being used, a gauge reading on the notice board of the lock control building shows the depth of water over the pass sill at the dam; the figures are in red on a white background, preceded by the word “Pass.”

#### Have Enough Line

Another essential in locking is adequate line. Its diameter depends on the size of your boat, and its length on the depth of the locks. Lines for locking through can be slightly smaller in diameter than your normal mooring lines; ½-inch line is often used for boats in the 35- to 50-foot (10.7-15.2 m) range, ⅜-inch for smaller boats. (If it can be found, manila is preferable to synthetic material because of its lower cost; locking lines will soon get too dirty for further use and must be discarded.) Some locks may provide lines, but be prepared; don’t count on their availability.

In general, bow and stern lines should be at least twice the depth of the deepest lock that you plan to go through. This length permits running the line around a bollard on the top of the lock wall and back to your boat, where it is constantly tended by hand. Then at the final level, when you are ready to cast off, you can turn loose one end and haul in on the other without assistance from above (which you are not likely to get); see Figure 22-17. When locking down, it’s extremely dangerous to make fast to a bollard above and then secure the line to a bitt or cleat on the boat. If the water level drops unexpectedly, the boat can be “hung up” and seriously damaged, with possible injuries to those on board. When locking up, line must be taken in steadily to keep the lines taut and the boat under control. Many experienced river boaters snub their lines on the side of their craft away from the lock wall so that the lines angle upward and inward to the top of the lock, tending to pull the boat closer to the wall.

Figure 22-17 One procedure makes use of two long lines leading from the bow and stern to bollards at the top of the lock wall and back to the boat. While they can be snubbed to a cleat to reduce the strain on the person tending them, they should never be fully cleated when locking down. Some skippers lead their lines to the side of their craft away from the wall if the lock is very deep.

#### Use of Ladders & Other Methods

Lock walls often have ladders recessed into them, should someone be unlucky enough to fall in. On some canals, small boats may follow a ladder up or down, rung by rung, holding on with boathooks or short lengths of line. On other canals, rules do not permit this, and the ladders must be kept clear for emergency use.

In addition to bollards at the top, some locks have posts recessed in the walls at intervals in a vertical line. Locking up, you can transfer your lines successively from lower posts to higher ones as you rise in this chamber.

In some new locks, floating mooring posts built into the walls move up and down with the water level. This makes for the easiest locking through of all, because you can use relatively short lines and they need no adjustment as your boat moves up or down.

#### Tend Your Lines Carefully

The watchword in locks is “safety.” Whether the water level is rising or falling, tend your lock lines carefully at all times; see Figure 22-18. You will need one crewmember forward and another aft; with only two people aboard, the helmsman can usually tend whichever line is nearest to him or her, generally the stern line. Single-handing in locks is definitely not recommended and may be prohibited by regulations. In some locks, coming up, special caution is required at the top of the lift. The boat may have been adequately fendered against the lock wall, but when the lock chamber is nearly full the boat’s gunwale may be above the wall and the topsides are then unprotected, particularly at a bow with flare.

Figure 22-18 Safety should always be your principal concern. You will need one crew member forward and one aft to tend lines. Single-handed crewing is not recommended. Special caution is needed when the boat’s gunwale is above the wall.

The Army Corps of Engineers publishes an informative illustrated leaflet entitled Locking Through. Write to the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, Pittsburgh District, 1000 Liberty Ave., Pittsburgh, PA 15222-418, or download a copy from www.lrp.usace.army.mil/Missions/Navigation/. It sets forth, concisely, the essentials as they apply to the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio rivers. For information specific to other river systems, search on “locking through” in your search engine.

### Spillways

Recreational boaters must keep clear of the spillway area below dams. The fishing there may be particularly good because fish tend to congregate below dams, but the hazards, too, are great. Spillway areas are subject to sudden changes as the dam’s gates and valves open and close; placid waters become turbulent with no warning at all as a heavy stream of water boils up unexpectedly from beneath the surface. Heed the warning signs and stay out of spillway areas.

### Artificial Land Cuts

Not all waterways are merely improved versions of natural rivers and lakes. Artificial land cuts are often needed to interconnect navigable waterways and provide continuous passage between major bodies of water. Lake Champlain, for example, is accessible from the upper reaches of the Hudson River only because of a 24-mile (38.6-km) completely artificial waterway cut into the land. A dredged land cut many miles long is also found at the western end of the Erie Canal to connect Lake Erie with rivers in the middle of the state

Narrow land cuts pose problems of their own. A typical cross section of a dredged canal might have a surface width of, for example, 125 feet (38 m), but a bottom width of only 75 feet (23 m) with a depth of 12 feet (3.7 m). If normal cruising speeds were maintained through such portions of a canal, the bank would be quickly washed down into the channel. In artificial waterways, therefore, speed limits are rigidly enforced. In the N.Y. State Canal System, the speed limit is 10 mph (16 km/h) unless otherwise posted. A telephone network between the various locks enables lock tenders to know when a boat running the proper speed is due; violators are quite easily caught! Some sets of locks also operate on time schedules, and it serves no purpose to go too fast, only to wait at the next lock.

Some land sections are cut through solid rock, perhaps only 100 feet (30.5 m) or less in width. This makes a virtual trough with ragged walls of blasted rock. In a confined channel such as this, the wakes of a group of boats may combine and reinforce each other in a synchronized pattern, building up out of all proportion to the wakes of each boat individually. Unless speed is held down as required by circumstances, regardless of the legal limit, small boats can get out of control, with the possibility of being thrown into the rock walls and suffering serious damage.

Speed limits are established for good reasons, and must be obeyed.

Figure 22-19 Entering the Chicago River. Much of our inland waterway system is man-made and requires on-going maintenance. Speeds on both artificial and natural sections may be strictly regulated. All vessels need to know their air draft to prevent contact with bridges and overhead power lines.

### Regulations

On the Western Rivers, no special permission or clearance is necessary for passage through the locks; there are, however, regulations to be observed. You can get copies of these from local Army Corps of Engineer offices; see also Appendix A.

The N.Y. Canal Corporation publishes a wealth of information including routes, vertical clearances, regulations, permits and tolls, and general safety information. See www.canals.ny.gov/boating/index.html and Appendix A.

## LAKE BOATING

The term “lake boating” has extreme limits. The water area involved can range from the smallest of natural or man-made lakes and reservoirs to the Great Lakes, really a group of inland seas; see Figure 22-20.

Figure 22-20 Many lakes provide a surprisingly large cruising area and sufficient depths for larger yachts. However, trailerable boats are the best choice for the boater who wants to explore more inaccessible locations.

Some lakes are “protected waters” at all times; others, particularly the Great Lakes, can produce waves hazardous even to ships of considerable size. While waves on these lakes are seldom of remarkable height, they are usually very steep and often require more caution than ocean waves in similar wind conditions.

An inland boater can cruise hundreds of miles and never be far from shelter in case of bad weather, but he must still treat the larger lakes with respect. Lake Superior, for example, is one of the largest bodies of fresh water in the world. Deep, with rock-lined coasts and subject to storms and fog as well, it can present a challenge to even the saltiest skipper. On Lake Erie, smaller and comparatively shallow, seas in a gale cannot shape up in the normal pattern of open ocean waves. Instead they are short and steep, frequently breaking in heavy squalls. Even Lake Oneida in midstate New York on the N.Y. State Canal System’s Barge Canal can build up seas that would be challenging to an offshore boater.

#### Water Levels

Lake levels vary from year to year and show a seasonal rise and fall as well—low in the winter and high in the summer. Monthly bulletins published during the navigation season show present and projected levels of the Great Lakes as well as average and record levels. More current information is contained in weekly reports released to newspapers and radio and television stations, and availvable on the Internet at www.glerl.noaa.gov/data/now.

In larger lakes, a steady, strong wind will lower levels to windward and pile up water on the leeward side. Barometric pressure can also influence lake levels, sometimes causing a sudden and temporary, but drastic, change in water level on any portion of a lake; this phenomenon is called a seiche.

### Lake Piloting

Many smaller lakes do not require “navigation” by the skipper and thus do not have charts as such. On larger lakes, however, shore lines may be many miles long; you should have a chart, sometimes called a map, and keep track of where you are at all times—piloting may be required, especially in changeable weather conditions or fog. On the largest lakes, you need to plot your course using a compass, make time-speed-distance calculations, and even take bearings and fixes—essentially all the actions of piloting except tidal calculations; see Figure 22-21.

Figure 22-21 On larger lakes, you will need to plot your course using a compass and standard time-speed-distance calculations. Lake charts, such as those for the Great Lakes (not shown here), often show principal routes between major ports, giving the course in degrees (true) and the distance in statute miles.

#### Great Lakes Charts

Charts of the Great Lakes, published by the National Ocean Service (NOS), are excellent, covering features of the navigable water in great detail. They show depths of water (the lesser depths in blue tint), safe channels, submerged reefs and shoals, aids to navigation, adjacent shorelines with topographic features and landmarks, types of bottom, and much related information. Scales vary from as large as 1:2,500 to 1:20,000 for harbor charts to 1:400,000 or 1:500,000 for general charts of individual lakes. The smallest scale used is for the general chart (14500) of all the Great Lakes at 1:1,500,000. The projection used for Great Lakes charts is usually polyconic. Several use the Mercator projection, and a few are published in a metric edition.

Great Lakes charts have a compass rose showing both true and magnetic directions with the variation stated. Magnetic variation in the Great Lakes varies from 13° W in the eastern end to 1°E in the extreme western waters; there is a small area in which the variation is 0°. In isolated areas, great deposits of iron ore in the earth produce strong local effects; this is most pronounced along the north shore of Lake Superior, where variation has been observed to change from 7° to 27° within a distance of only 650 feet (200 meters)!

Many lake charts show the principal routes between major ports, giving the course in degrees (true) and distance in statute miles. Comparative elevations are referred to mean tide as calculated at New York City. Local heights and depths are measured from an established datum for each lake.

The Great Lakes are partly Canadian waters, and excellent charts for these areas are available from the Canadian Hydrographic Survey, Ottawa. These all use the Mercator projection.

#### Coast Pilot 6 (Great Lakes Pilot)

To supplement the information on Great Lakes charts, get a copy of the current edition of the Coast Pilot 6, published by the NOS. This most useful volume provides full descriptions of the waters charted, laws and regulations governing navigation, bridge clearance, signals for locks and bridges, dimensions and capacities of marine railways, and weather information. Keep your copy corrected from Local Notices to Mariners issued by the 9th Coast Guard District, Cleveland, Ohio. Similar texts are published by the Canadian Hydrographic Service.

#### Great Lakes Light List

The U.S. Coast Guard publishes the Light List, Volume VII, covering the Great Lakes; see this page.

This Light List includes some Canadian buoys and lights, identified by the letter “C” following the name of the aid. Except for minor differences in design, the buoyage systems used for Canada and the United States are the same. The Canadian buoyage system also makes greater use of cardinal buoys (see this page) than the U.S. Coast Guard.

#### Caution Along Some Shores

In some lakes, such as Lake Champlain, depth becomes a factor. Certain shores may be particularly inviting because of their scenic attractions, but they may have depths of several hundred feet running right up to sheer cliff shores. If your engine fails, your anchor will be of little use in such deep water, and if the breeze is toward those cliffs you can be blown against them.

### Rules & Regulations

Many smaller inland lakes do not fall under federal jurisdiction and are regulated by the appropriate states or other agencies. Other lakes are considered “navigable waters of the United States” where federal rules and regulations apply. Check on the status of unfamiliar waters if you have any doubts.

#### Navigation Rules

The U.S. Inland Navigational Rules apply to all vessels on waters subject to federal regulations; refer to Chapters 4 and 5. The Canadian side of the Great Lakes and other border waterways are, of course, subject to Canada’s rules.

#### Pollution-Control Regulations

Water pollution is a very serious concern on all lakes, especially those that are a source of domestic drinking water. Many complex regulations may be in effect. Regulations on overboard discharge of sewage and even treated waste are very strictly enforced and are particularly important for boaters crossing state or international boundaries. Some states are known for their zealous application of environmental laws, especially regarding recreational boating. When visiting a new area, be sure to check with the local authorities; also see Appendix A.

# CHAPTER23

MARLINESPIKE SEAMANSHIP

Ropes & Lines • How They Are Made & Used • Knots & Splices Care & Maintenance of Lines • Blocks & Tackle

From anchor rodes to sheets, vangs, and whippings, anyone concerned with the work of a boat becomes involved with lines, knots, and splices—and their proper use. This knowledge and the related hand skills are as important to a powerboat skipper as they are to the owner of a sailboat. They comprise a subject recognized for its fascinating lore, for the beautiful artifacts that are a part of it, and for its sheer practicality. Working with cordage—the collective name for ropes, lines, and “small stuff”—is an ancient skill that now takes in new technologies.

The information that follows is intended to give you a picture of:

• The construction, materials, and characteristics of various kinds of modern cordage

• The tools, techniques, and special words used in working with cordage

• The procedures for making and using knots, bends, hitches, and splices

• The coiling and storage of lines, as well as their care and inspection

The nautical name for this special information and skill is marlinespike seamanship. Once used extensively with rigging, marline is a two-strand twine; a marlinespike, often one blade of a sailor’s rigging knife, is used for separating the strands of laid rope or wire for splicing, as covered later in this chapter.

## ROPES & LINES

Purchased as “rope,” once it is in use on board a boat rope is called line, or by name of the rigging part it has become. Sailors will tell you that there aren’t many ropes aboard a ship or boat. There is the bolt rope at the foot or luff of a sail, or a tiller rope, or a foot rope attached to the lower border of a sail, or a bell rope, or a few other rare ones. Everything else is a line.

### Rope Materials

Like a sailor’s knife, rope goes back thousands of years. For centuries rope was made from natural fibers, including jute, sisal, and manila (from the wild banana plant) and especially flax and hemp. Most rope was laid, usually three strands twisted together. Each strand is composed of three yarns, each of which is composed of multiple fibers; see Figure 23-01. Boaters work with knots and splices that have been in use for centuries, based on the standard way rope was made by twisting fibers.

Figure 23-01 “Three-stranded rope” is made up of three strands that are laid or twisted together, usually with a right-hand lay. Each strand has a left-hand lay, and each yarn’s fibers have a right-hand twist.

Since the mid-20th century, there have been more technological changes in rope than in the preceding thousand years. New synthetic fibers have altered the form of rope and even the way particular splices or knots are made and used. The new kinds of cordage are so superior that a boater has little reason to pay any attention to most of the old materials, although he may have difficulty in making the right choice among the new forms.

The most obvious change is in the form of rope itself—probably more than half the rope used in recreational boating in the U.S. is plaited, braided, or double-braided (a core inside a cover), compared to the traditional, three-strand laid rope. Small stuff, used for whippings and seizings, is also greatly changed. Shock cord and even monofilament line have special uses, all made possible by new materials.

#### Synthetic Materials

The first important synthetic fiber to appear was polyamide (nylon). Nylon rope is strong (more than twice as strong as the best yacht manila for the same size), has useful qualities of elasticity or controlled stretch, and has gone through successive improvements. This rope can be given various degrees of softness or hardness, some variation in surface textures, and can be obtained in various colors to fit its intended uses. With its shock-absorbing elasticity it is particularly well suited for dock lines and anchor lines.

High-intensity polyester fiber (Dacron, Terylene, Duron, Fortrel, A.C.E., and Kodel are trade names) is made into rope that is virtually as strong as nylon but has one important difference: the rope can be made to have very little stretch. This property makes polyester fiber superior for special purposes like the running rigging on sailboats, where elasticity is undesirable. In manufacturing, polyester rope can be given varied finishes as required by the intended application: woolly, smooth, or textured to make it easy to grip. It can also be colored.

Polypropylene rope is least expensive among the synthetics; it is as strong as nylon or polyester but tends to deteriorate rapidly from exposure to the ultraviolet component of sunlight. Its main advantage is that it floats, which the others do not do, so it is suited to some commercial fishing applications as well as to tow ropes for waterskiing and dinghy painters. It is quite slippery, and many knots will not hold in a “poly” line. For appropriate special purposes, it should be a larger size (compared to nylon) and renewed frequently.

Many other synthetic fibers have found their way into the marine rope market in recent years. Kevlar and Technora—both aramid fibers—are stronger, pound for pound, than steel and have less than 1% stretch. Their disadvantages include their poor internal abrasion resistance, which gives them low tolerance for small-radius bends (as in knots and halyard sheaves). They are also susceptible to degradation from UV rays and are thus best used in rope cores, where they are surrounded and protected by covers of a different material (see below). They are also increasingly blended with other fibers to capitalize on their strength and resistance to stretch while counteracting their weaknesses. Their final disadvantage—high cost—remains perhaps their most serious, limiting their use primarily to large sailing yachts and competitive racing sailboats.

High-modulus poyethylene (HMPE) fibers are sold under the brand names Dyneema and Spectra. These are similar to aramid fibers in strength and resistance to stretch and are more resistant to abrasion. They also float. Dyneema and Spectra are slippery, however, and do not hold knots well, and they tend to “creep” (elongate) under prolonged loads. Like the aramids, they are very expensive and are usually found in combination with polyester in specialized ropes.

Another new synthetic is a liquid-crystal polymer (LCP) sold under the trade names Vectran and Ticona, which is extremely strong, both stretch- and creep-resistant, and extremely expensive. It too is more frequently blended with other fibers than used in pure form.

The great majority of boats are still best served by nylon anchor lines, nylon or polyester docklines, and polyester running rigging. Various constructions of these well-proven, moderately priced synthetics have evolved for different purposes. We’ll look at those next.

### Rope Construction

The construction of three-strand laid rope has changed little in thousands of years except for varying surface textures. New materials and new types of rope-making machines have caused one particularly significant development in rope construction, however: braided and double braided ropes.

The various kinds of rope “geometry” are worth looking at in some detail, starting with the oldest.

#### Three-strand Rope

Some knowledge of the anatomy of three-strand rope makes it easier to work with, especially in splicing and in finishing off the ends (a subject discussed at the end of this chapter).

If you hold the rope so that the end is away from your body, the strands will seem to have a twist that is clockwise. This is called “right-hand lay.” Most rope has a right-land lay, and has since the pyramids were built. If you look at the yarns in just one of the three strands, you will see that they have a left-hand twist. Finally, in all but the smallest ropes, the fibers that comprise each yarn have a right-hand lay; refer to Figure 23-01.

Because some tension is put on the rope in manufacturing, these opposing twists of fiber, yarn, and strand tend to keep the rope from unlaying, or untwisting.

When you splice you will be working with these twists, sometimes retwisting a short length of strand with your fingers and splicing (interweaving) the strands back into the normal lay of the rope. Since virtually all laid rope is right-handed, your fingers should learn to work with the twist, whether you are tying knots, splicing, or coiling.

Laid rope comes in several degrees of hardness or stiffness. The technical terms are soft lay, medium lay, and hard lay. For boating purposes you will probably use only medium lay. (sailmaker’s lay is another variation, but unless you’re making sails you won’t need it.) Very soft lay is sometimes on sale, and is superficially attractive—silky soft, like milkweed seedpods. It’s of little use on a boat, however, because it kinks easily. Hard-laid rope, used commercially, may be too difficult to work with to be of any value on small craft.

You may read about, but seldom see, four-strand rope and left-hand lay rope; both are for special purposes. And there is one more “twist” about rope—to make very large cables, such as those that tugs or large ships use, three right-hand-lay ropes can be twisted together with a left-hand lay; this is called cable lay.

Most wire rope is made the same way, by twisting strands. The more intricate strandings, with 7 x 7 and 1 x 19 strands, are seen most often. In 7 x 7, seven strands, each in turn consisting of seven wires, are twisted together; in 1 x 19, 19 single strands make up the rope. This 1 x 19 wire rope is stronger but less flexible than the 7 x 7 type, and is used primarily for standing rigging; see Figure 23-02.

Figure 23-02 Wire rope is stranded in 7 x 7 format, left, which is often used for running rigging, or in 1 x 19 format, right, the type used for sailboat standing rigging.

#### Braided Line

When strands are interwoven rather than twisted together, what results is braided rather than laid rope. In single-braid (sometimes called “solid braid”), the braiding is continued through the rope’s interior to create a uniform cross section. Small-diameter (¼-inch and smaller) single-braid is used for flag halyards, to tie the ends of sail-bags, and for special purposes such as awnings; see Figure 23-03. Larger-diameter single-braided nylon is sometimes used for docklines, and single-braided polyester of ½ inch and larger is popular for mainsheets, often with a spun-polyester fiber for ease of handling. Most single-braid line can’t be spliced unless it’s a hollow braid—i.e., unless the braided cover surrounds a hollow core. Hollow-braided polypropylene is used for swimming lane lines and waterski tow ropes, but hollow-braid is otherwise rare.

Figure 23-03 Single-braid (lower) in small diameters (1/4-inch and smaller) is used for flag halyards, sail bag ties, and similar purposes. Plaited line (upper) is a variation of braided line. Shown here is eight-plait rope.

Double-braided In double-braided rope, a braided core is surrounded by a braided cover; see Figure 23-04. Double-braid is very flexible because both the cover and the core are composed of small strands. Its resistance to abrasion is excellent because the wear is distributed over many strands. Braided line tends to coil evenly and, unlike laid line, is virtually kink free (does not hockle). It requires special techniques for splicing, covered later in this chapter.

Figure 23-04 Braided line may be either single-braid (top) or double-braid (above). Double-braid, sometimes called braid-on-braid, is used for many purposes on boats of all types and sizes. It has some stretch, but less than three-strand twisted line.

On both sailboats and powerboats you will often see double-braid nylon used for dock lines because of its smooth running and easy-on-the-hands characteristics; occasionally it will be used for anchor lines. You’ll see double-braid polyester used for sheets, halyards, and other running rigging on sailboats because it stretches less than polyester three-strand or single-braid (and much less than nylon line of any construction).

plaited line is an inexpensive variation on braided line that resists hockling and finds favor on commercial vessels. Eight-plait rope, also called square braid, is shown in Figure 23-03. Twelve-plait rope is seen in towing hawsers.

Other constructions have joined laid and braided line in recent years, just as other synthetics have joined nylon and polyester. In parallel-core rope, a braided cover (usually polyester) surrounds a core of straight, bundled fibers, which might be polyester, Kevlar, Spectra, Vectran, Technora, or some blend of these to achieve varying degrees of strength and resistance to stretch; see Figure 23-05. A parallel polyester core within a polyester braided cover is more resistant to stretch than double-braid and is finding increasing use in sailboat halyards.

Figure 23-05 A core comprised of parallel fibers, as here, yields as much as 20% more strength and 20% less stretch than a braided core of similar diameter. The gauze wrapper visible in this photo contains the core fibers during the rope manufacturing process.

Figure 23-06 These ropes from New England Ropes are made from polyester fiber and optimized for specific purposes. Top to bottom: (1) A three-strand rope in which spun polyester, which yields a softer “hand,” is blended with filament polyester for strength; popular for sheets and halyards on classic sailboats. (2) Three-strand line made entirely of filament polyester. (3) Regatta Braid is a single-braid line made from a blend of spun and filament polyester and used for main- and jibsheets on a variety of sailing yachts. (4) Sta-Set double braid is an all-purpose rope for cruising sailors and can be used for sheets, halyards, guys, control lines, reef lines, and furling lines. (5) Sta-Set X has a parallel core for use as halyards, where less stretch is desirable.

#### Other Types of Rope

In addition to stranded and braided rope, several other forms of flexible materials have special uses aboard boats. These materials are not traditional cordage, but they do some of the same things rope or small lines will do.

Shock cord is multistrand rubber with a synthetic cover. It can stretch twice its length. The uses of shock cord are endless: to hold topping lifts out of the way, to make quick lash-ups for furling sails, to hold halyards away from the mast, and to hold a pair of oars on a cabin top or books in a book rack. Shock cord is not as strong as rope; its extreme elasticity makes it unsuitable for many purposes, and it cannot be spliced. Its ends can be made up with shrink tubing or plastic or metal clips to prevent fraying; eyes (actually looped ends in the shape of eye splices) are made the same way. A loop at one end of a short piece of shock cord and a toggle inset at the other end makes a good tie to keep a coil of line in place.

Webbing is made of woven nylon or polyester, and is used for sail stops (replacing the traditional sewn strips of doubled sailcloth) and for dinghy tie-downs as well as hold-downs for boats on trailers. Webbing is very strong, and when used for sail ties it holds well with a square knot or a slippery reef knot. Webbing is either single or hollow flat (double).

Monofilament is another kind of line found on boats. Its main use is for fishing lines, and a heavier piece makes a good lanyard for a pocket stopwatch or cell-phone case. Monofilament fish line must be knotted only in specific ways or it will invariably come untied.

Small stuff is a term used by the typical old salt, sitting on a hatch cover making up whippings, servings, and seizings. Waxed nylon line and flat braid (also called parachute cord) is used for whippings and to prevent chafe. Marline, a tan-colored two-strand string used for servings, is now scarce. Cod-line, a similar three-strand material, is useful if you can get it.

### Selecting the Correct Rope

In the course of boat ownership, you will need to make decisions about what size and type of rope to buy for new dock and anchor lines, or how to improve the rigging when replacing a sheet, vang, or halyard. In addition to the factors already reviewed concerning elasticity and the form of rope, you need to consider other points, including size.

#### Sizes

The size of rope, in the United States, is customarily given as its diameter in inches, particularly in the recreational-boat sizes. But since most of the rest of the world measures rope by its circumference and in millimeters, you will see more and more line described by “nominal” size with metric comparison tables. In addition, manufacturers and sellers of rope know very well that a piece of braided rope, held loosely, is thicker than one stretched out. Because of this, they market such rope by its weight, which is a more accurate measure of the amount of material. At some marine stores, however, you will find all types of rope sold by length, often in prepackaged kits.

#### Strength Ratings

Experts, concerned with safety and dependability, say that the working load for laid line should not exceed 11 percent of its tensile strength—the load, in pounds of “pull,” at which the rope would break (part). Braided rope is normally specified for use at or under 20 percent of its tensile strength. As rope ages, it inevitably suffers from abrasion and sunlight. Braided rope has the advantage that the core, providing a major part of the strength, is protected. All parts of laid rope suffer from wear. See Table 23-1 for data on the weight and breaking strength of various types of rope in a range of typical sizes.

Table 23-1 When buying rope, keep these points in mind: A soft, compliant rope may be stronger and easier to splice, but it will not wear as well and is more apt to hockle or unlay than a well “locked-up” rope. Blended ropes, part polyolefins and part other fibers, may be found. Multifilament (fine filament) polypropylene looks like nylon, but don’t expect it to be as strong—it floats, nylon doesn’t. Spun, or stapled, nylon and high-intensity polyester (such as Dacron) are not as strong as ropes made of continuous filaments but are easier to grasp; these are sometimes used for sheets on sailboats.

In practice, a commonsense approach is often the determining factor. A small size of rope might be strong enough for a jib sheet, but a larger size will be easier to grasp with the hands.

#### Varieties Available

There are dozens of brands, configurations, and combinations of materials, particularly in braided rope. Sometimes one characteristic—reduced stretch, for example—changes another, such as ease of splicing.

The surface textures of braided polyester ropes vary. Those made with continuous filaments are shiny, smooth, and strong. Those made with spun yarn (short filaments) are softer, fuzzier, and not quite as strong. Select the shiny ones for halyards and the fuzzier ones for sheets, where being easier on the hands and better gripping of the drums of winches are important qualities.

Some skippers who do a lot of night sailing use lines of different surface texture, with different feel for different purposes, such as sheets and guys.

#### Color Coding

The use of color coding for racing and cruising sailboats is common. The lines may have a solid color, or be white with a colored “tracer.” A recommended standard is:

• Mainsail sheet and halyard—white

• Jib/genoa sheets and halyards—blue

• Spinnaker sheets and halyard—red

• Topping lifts—green

• Vangs and travelers—orange

#### Matching Size with Use

For most uses, the appropriate size of rope is one that is large enough to be comfortable in the hands under normal working situations. A flag halyard, which has very little strain on it, can be thin to reduce wind resistance.

Sail halyards must be strong enough to take the tremendous strain of the sail filled with wind, with minimum stretch, be resistant to abrasion at the sheaves, and still offer the least possible wind resistance.

The proper size of a line may be determined by still another factor: chafing. A dock line or anchor line, for instance, is used many times, sometimes chafes seriously and sometimes not at all, and yet should always be strong enough to hold under extreme storm conditions. A mooring pennant needs to be many times stronger than is required for the worst possible storm conditions, partly because the big fall storm may come at the end of the season, when the line has already been weakened by various small chafings. (See Chapter 9 for more details on anchor and mooring lines.)

Matching Line Size and Blocks If a line is a bit too large for a block or other type of fairlead, or a chock, you run the risk of binding, jamming, or chafing; see Figure 23-07. Sometimes the solution is not a smaller line but a larger fitting.

Figure 23-07 Blocks should be matched to the lines used. Otherwise, you run the risk of lines binding, jamming, or chafing.

If a line is too small for a particular block, it can get caught between the sheave and the shell—another kind of jam. (Refer to Figure 23-17 for the parts of a block.) If a wire sheave is adapted for rope, the sheave must be dressed down for a proper groove. (Be aware that for comparable sizes, rope will have only a fraction of the strength of wire.)

The diameter of the sheave in a block can also be important. If a line makes a 180° change of direction over a very small sheave, the stress on the line is obvious. Sometimes naval architects use two small blocks at the top of the mast to reduce the stress within the rope—each block gives the halyard a 90° turn. Similarly, a fairlead that makes a change in direction in a line results in a certain amount of friction; if the line goes through the fairlead at an extreme angle, the friction is greater. In such a situation a block might well be better than a simpler fairlead, to make the line handling easier as well as to minimize abrasion.

#### Use Good Rope

The problems of cheap rope may be hidden, but they are real. Some polypropylene rope, at the bottom of the cost scale, is made from large-diameter filaments. Rope with finer filaments costs more but lasts longer and is much stronger. Hard-lay nylon, which may be old, is so difficult to work with that it may not be worth its low price.

As you work with the variety of lines aboard a boat, you will form the habit of constantly checking for chafe and other problems: a splice that is beginning to fray, a chock with a rough corner that will weaken a dock line by chafing, a block whose sheave tends to be stiff and needs cleaning and lubricating. Frequent inspection of gear and rigging, and replacement, lubrication, or other suitable repair is an important part of good seamanship.

Information on inspection details and procedures is given near the end of this chapter under “Care & Maintenance of Lines”; see this page.

#### Availability

The retail availability of special kinds of rope can be a problem for some boaters. An inland hardware store may stock several kinds and sizes of rope—suitable mainly for farmers and homeowners. Preferences and needs also vary among commercial fishermen, recreational powerboat owners, and sailors.

Sometimes there are special solutions. If you can’t find waxed flat braid for whippings at a marine dealer, talk to a sailmaker. If all you need at the moment is a small size, waxed nylon dental tape is roughly similar. If you plan on making up a polypropylene dinghy painter that will float, and thus stay out of the way of propeller blades, try a source that supplies commercial fishing boats; and get the black rope—it’s the most resistant to sunlight.

## MARLINESPIKE TOOLS

For most everyday work with rope you need only your fingers and a good knife. But many marlinespike jobs need special tools, a few professional techniques, and some standard materials.

Here is what you would find in an experienced sailor’s “ditty bag,” plus some of the extras that might be in the tool locker or perhaps on a home workbench for most kinds of marlinespike seamanship:

A good knife, preferably the type called a rigging knife, with a built-in marlinespike and probably a hasp that is used for opening and closing shackles; see Figure 23-08. The blade should be sharp; often a keen but slightly jagged edge works well on synthetic rope. If you don’t have a sharpening stone, a file from the engine toolbox will keep the blade sharp.

Figure 23-08 The combination knife and marlinespike is the tool most often used in marlinespike work. The tool seen below the knife blade is a hasp, used for opening shackles.

A large fid or marlinespike, for separating the strands of laid rope when splicing. You can usually splice small sizes of laid line, if it’s fairly soft, using only your fingers. But a fid (usually of wood or plastic) or metal spike, used to separate the strands and to get the strand you are working with through quickly and easily, makes any splicing easier and is usually a necessity for larger sizes of rope.

Special fids will be needed for splicing double-braided rope, different sizes matched to the diameter of the rope. Several types of hollow fids and other special tools are on the market.

Sailmaker’s needles (keep them in a small plastic bottle) for making whippings and repairing sail slide attachments and jib hank fastenings. Keep several sizes of needles on hand.

A sailmaker’s palm (left or right handed) to push the needles through the rope; see Figure 23-09. Even if you don’t expect to repair sails, a palm is a good handtool. Keep the leather soft by applying neatsfoot oil twice a year.

Figure 23-09 A traditional sailmaker’s palm is needed to push needles through heavy sailcloth when making repairs. Strong waxed thread is used in this work.

A pair of scissors.

A pair of pliers. Simple sharp-nosed are best.

Waxed sail twine (tape and/or cord) and perhaps some old-fashioned brown marline for a traditional-looking project. As you’ll see at the end of this chapter, waxed nylon twine or lacing tape is used to make whippings on the ends of lines. Lacing tape, which is flat and plaited, is also used for sail fittings; even if you never sew a sail you’ll need twine or tape for lashings. Many people also keep a piece of beeswax in their ditty bags for waxing twine.

A source of heat is needed to melt and seal the ends of synthetic rope. A candle and matches or the flame in a galley stove will do if you follow a careful safety procedure of heating an old knife blade and then applying it to the rope to melt it. On shore (or if your boat has 120-volt AC power) an electric hot knife is best; see below.

An electric rope cutter. Not everyone needs this professional tool, which plugs into an electrical outlet and uses a hot wire or blade to melt the rope (quickly, smoothly, and sealing the ends). However, many amateur sailors who like to work with rope own one. Perhaps the handiest tool for the boat owner is an electric soldering gun, with a special cutting head obtainable from hardware stores. This knife-like head is also useful for melting and smoothing the fine strands of rope that are left after a splice is made. Electric rope cutters or hot knives require 120-volt AC power.

Plastic tape for temporary whippings. White tape with some stretch to it, black electrical tape, waterproof sail repair tape, or first-aid tape will do. These are all adhesive tapes, unlike the nylon lacing tapes referred to earlier.

Liquid, quick-drying plastic for dipping rope ends into as a substitute for a twine whipping or other end finish for a line. They are called Whip-It, Whip End Dip, or similar names.

Keep all the tools and materials well enclosed against moisture, which can make scissors and knives useless. A canvas ditty bag with plastic wraps for the metal tools will do, as will a tight-closed plastic box; see Figure 23-10.

Figure 23-10 A typical ditty bag includes a number of marlinespike tools, from a sailmaker’s palm to an electric hot knife. Keep all tools and materials protected from moisture, which can render scissors and other tools useless. A canvas ditty bag with plastic wraps for the metal tools will do, as will a tight-closing plastic box.

##### DEFINING MARLINESPIKE TERMS

Many of the special terms used in marlinespike seamanship are best understood by handling line or by looking at illustrations. The standing part is the long end of a piece of line. If you loop the working part back on itself, you form a bight. If the bight is around an object or the rope itself, it’s a turn; if it’s a complete circle, it’s a round turn. The extreme other end of the line is the bitter end; see the illustration. All bends, hitches, knots, and even splices are technically knots, but to the purist there are differences. A splice was only a form of interweaving of the strands—until braided rope came along with a new form.

A whipping is small twine or tape wrapped tightly around and sometimes through the end of a rope to keep it from unraveling. A seizing is a similar wrap-around, but for other purposes, such as binding two parts of a line together in a piece of rigging; binding a rope end to the standing part to prevent a knot from capsizing or loosening, as in Figure 23-11; cinching and binding the throat of a thimbled eye splice; or binding a sail hank to a sail. parceling is a more complex wraparound, combining twine and tape, to take wear or prevent chafe. The illustrations allow you to compare these somewhat similar methods. Another term is locking, which means sewing through the throat of a braided line eye splice to hold it in place.

Whipping, left, prevents the end of the line from unlaying. Seizing, center, is used to bind two lines together. Worming, parceling, and serving, right, are used to protect a line against severe chafing.

##### COILING & STOWING LINES

When you handle lines on board any boat, you soon learn some basic techniques; one of these is how to coil a line, and another is how to stow it.

###### COILING A LINE

Laid line, having its natural twist built in, should always be coiled clockwise so it won’t hockle (kink) or tangle. If it’s an unused dock line, either end can be used to start a coil. Otherwise, always start at the secured end—where the halyard or sheet is cleated, for example—and work toward the free end. Never start at the free end—you’ll end up with a twisted, awkward coil that’s anything but docile. If the line to be coiled is loose and untangled, it’s easy. If it looks the least bit tangled, “overhaul” it by running it through your hands from one end to the other, so it’s ready to be coiled.

Now, start by holding the line in your left hand. With an easy sweeping motion, using your right hand, bring each coil to your left hand and take it in with your fingers. Remember that the coils are always clockwise. An even sweep of your arm, the same distance each time, will result in coils of the same size. Sometimes your thumb is used to add or control a twist—it takes practice.

A flemish coil is an attractive way to deal with the free end of a line in use, but don’t leave it in place too long.

Don’t try to wind up the line over your elbow, unless you’re a landlubber in the backyard doing clothesline. (If you are left-handed, you may want to reverse the “left” and “right” instructions above.)

When working with braided line, you may wish to coil it as you would a hose, alternating the direction in which each coil is gathered to prevent an accumulation of torque in the line. The loops of rope gathered in this way will pay out freely and smoothly, avoiding the creation of the kinks that can foul when the line runs through a block. Conventional laid line can also be coiled in this manner once it has been in use long enough to reduce its initial stiffness.

###### STOWING A COILED LINE

What you do next with the coil or figure eight depends on circumstances. If the line is the end of a jib sheet that will be used again in a few minutes, or the unused part of a dock line that you need to keep ready, just turn the coil so the free end is down and lay it on the deck, in the corner of the cockpit, or wherever is convenient.

If the coil is to be hung up, which it will be in most cases, there are several ways to do it. A completely free coil of line, such as a fairly heavy spare anchor line that is to be stowed for a while, can be tied up—using shock cord or rope straps made up for the purpose, or small pieces of spare line. A newer, convenient method is to use cinch straps of Velcro self-adhering tape. If it is a very heavy and long line, you would do best to lay it on the deck in figure eights when coiling—you couldn’t hold the coil in your hand anyway. On a ship this is called faking (sometimes flaking) down.

A free coil, such as an unused dock line that you may use again soon, is often handled as follows: take a short arm’s length of the end of the line and wrap the coil with three, four, or five turns. Then reach through the coil above the wraps you just made, pull a bight of the remaining free end through the coil, loop that bight up and over the top of the coil, and cinch up with the free end. Hang the coil up on a cleat or hook using the free end. This is known as a gasket coil. When you want to use the line, the loop comes out quickly and the whole coil is readily available.

A halyard is handled somewhat similarly, except that:

1. Don’t wrap the coil. Leave it free, for quickest availability when the sail is to be dropped.

2. Use the standing part of the line, not the free end, to make the pass-through loop, and to keep it from slipping loose give it a turn or two as you hang it on the cleat.

There is another way to deal with the free end of a line that is somewhat more decorative: a flemish coil; see opposite page. This is easy to do on deck or pier, and it looks “yachtlike,” but if you leave it there for an extended period of time, it will attract dirt and moisture and leave a soiled mark behind when it is picked up.

Of course, an eye splice is very useful in one end of a dock line; it makes a good loop with which to hang up the line.

After wrapping a coil, pull a bight of the free end through the coil and then pass it over the top. Pull on the free end to cinch.

To hang a halyard coil, use the standing line to make a pass through the loop that goes on the cleat.

The term “faking a coil,” or “flaking,” means, simply, to lay the rope in the form of a figure eight.

## USE OF ROPES & LINES

So far we have been looking at rope and line primarily as the raw materials of marlinespike seamanship. Now we turn our attention to their use, and you will notice the additional special language that is used aboard boats.

### Use of Lines on Boats

Various lines find common use on powerboats and sailboats—dock lines, anchor rodes, lines for towing, and others. Sailing craft, of course, have many other lines specifically for their mode of propulsion. These numerous applications are covered in other chapters in this book.

## KNOTS, BENDS & HITCHES

The first principle in dealing with laid rope is that it has a twist, and you must work with it, not against it. This applies to splicing and knotting as well as to coiling.

You will also feel how a little friction of one part of the rope against another holds it fast. That’s the second principle for any kind of rope: in knots, splices, bends, or hitches, the pressure of the rope against itself, as it tightens, is what does the holding.

The third principle is a rule, a definition: a good knot is one that can be made almost automatically (your fingers learn to do it, just as they learn to write your name), that holds securely in the usage it is meant for, and that can be unfastened or untied readily. With practice, you will be able to tie knots in the dark or in more than one position.

Some knots are adjustable; others are not. At times, the choice of which knot to use depends on the size or character of the line involved—there are variations in the way line works, as will be mentioned in this chapter.

Most of the following information about specific knots concerns their efficient use. The illustrations on this page, in the sidebar “Most-Used Knots on Board Recreational Boats,” will help you tie them.

##### MOST-USED KNOTS ON BOARD RECREATIONAL BOATS

###### OVERHAND KNOT

Shown here chiefly because it’s simple, and helps explain the figure-eight knot shown below. Use it sparingly; it’s almost impossible to untie after it is tightened. (It is useful to hold the end of a winch line on a trailer hitch.)

###### FIGURE-EIGHT KNOT

One more turn into the overhand knot gives you an effective stopper knot to keep the end of a line from running through a block or small grommet. Easy to untie.

###### BOWLINE (BOW-LINE)

This is the most useful of all knots on board a boat. Once learned (and practice is necessary), it is easy to make, never slips or jams, and can always be untied. Two bowlines, one on each line, make an excellent combination when you need to tie two lines together.

###### TWO HALF HITCHES

For fastening a line to something else, such as a grommet in the corner of an awning. Quick and easy, but for many special purposes there are better knots you will prefer. A single half hitch also has some special uses.

###### REEF KNOT OR SQUARE KNOT

Note that the two bitter ends are on the same side of the standing parts. If the line is under constant pressure and if both ends are the same diameter, the knot will hold and can be untied even when wet. It is used to tie the ends of canvas or webbing strips around a furled sail and to tie reef points around the bunt of a reefed sail. Use the reef knot sparingly, however, as it is liable to capsize and slip. A sheet bend is a better choice for tying two lines together.

###### GRANNY KNOT

This is a knot that too many people tie automatically when they are trying to tie a square knot. They should teach their fingers to go the other way, because the granny is a useless knot. Sometimes it slips, and sometimes it jams. It has no value at all on a boat.

###### COW HITCH OR LARK’S HEAD

A small existing loop (usually an eye splice, not shown here) turned inside itself when you want to fasten a line to a large piling. It is also useful to fasten such a loop to a ring, provided the other end of the line is free. Many people use this hitch to fasten a jib sheet to the clew of a jib on a small sailboat.

###### SLIPPED REEF KNOT

A square knot with the end of one line reversed to make it easy to untie. Good for furling a sail. This is always easier to untie than a square knot.

###### SHEET BEND

This is an excellent way to tie two lines together, especially if they are of different sizes or textures. As you will realize when you practice tying knots, some are just variations on a theme. You can use part of a sheet bend to fasten onto a loop.

###### BECKET HITCH

This is really a sheet bend in which one line has a loop, such as an eye splice (near left) or bowline. If an extra round turn is taken (right), this is called a double becket hitch. This version is especially useful when the added-on line is smaller than the one with the loop.

###### BUNTLINE HITCH

This is excellent for fastening a halyard to a shackle. It is its own stopper knot and won’t jam in a block as an eye splice might. Sometimes called the inside clove hitch or the studding sail tack bend, this is easy to tie and untie. Another use is on a trailer winch snap shackle—a modern use for a hitch from square-rigger days.

###### CARRICK BEND

This is one of the traditional ways to fasten two lines of the same size together. It looks beautiful in a drawing, but under strain it changes appearance. The carrick bend is probably best for fairly heavy, stiff lines of the same size.

###### ROLLING HITCH

To tie a small line to the standing part of a larger one, so it won’t slip, use the rolling hitch. You can use this hitch to hold a jib sheet while riding turns are removed from a winch, to haul on any line, or to make an adjustable loop for an awning tie-down. The rolling hitch is also used to attach a line to a round wooden or metal object with the least possibility of slipping sideways. It will hold best when a second rolling hitch is made with the free end. It is also very useful for making a fender line fast to a lifeline or rail.

###### ANCHOR BEND

Also called a fisherman’s bend. This is a standard way to fasten an anchor line to the ring of an anchor. It is excellent for making up a spare anchor, and it may be used in many other situations. The double loop reduces possible chafe and makes the half hitches more secure. Of course there are other ways to make an anchor line fast, including a bowline or an eye splice over a thimble, plus a shackle. Seizing the free end to the standing end provides extra security; see Figure 23-11.

###### SURGEON’S KNOT

Tying the ordinary square or reef knot, even around a parcel, often requires a helper—someone to hold a finger on the half-formed knot until it is completed. If you take the extra turn of a surgeon’s knot, the friction/tension holds it while you complete the knot. Surgeons, of course, call it a suture knot.

###### MARLINESPIKE HITCH

This is used to take up on a whipping or serving while it’s being made—a good way to get it very tight. Withdraw the spike, and the hitch vanishes.

###### ASHLEY’S STOPPER KNOT

This makes a hefty stopper for the end of a line, looks seaman-like, and is easily undone. It takes a little longer to tie than the figure eight, and should be drawn up with some care.

###### CLOVE HITCH

Commonly used to tie a line to a piling. This is often a mistake. Although very adjustable, it tends to slip, especially with slippery nylon line. It is best to take an extra half hitch (or two half hitches) to make it secure. If you use the same line from the bow to a piling, and then to the stern, the clove hitch is ideal. Both ends are taut and you have the adjustable feature.

###### REVERSE SURGEON’S KNOT

Aboard a sailboat there is one special purpose for a version of the surgeon’s knot; tying the strings at the end of the older type of batten pocket. While the square knot will usually shake loose, perhaps leading to the loss of the batten, there is a cure. If you tie a reverse surgeon’s knot—the extra twist in the second half of the knot is what’s important –it will hold tightly no matter how the wind shakes it.

###### MONKEY FIST

Used to make a ball at the end of a heaving line. Make three loops around your hand, some 4 feet from the end of the line. Take the working end to make three more loops around, at right angles to the first three. The final set of loops is made around the inner group. Seize or splice the end to the standing part.

###### CLEAT HITCH-CLEATING A LINE

Start with a turn around the cleat, then go around the cleat so that the line passes under each horn once. Finish with a half hitch over one horn. More wrappings and hitches are not needed, and they only slow the process of casting off.

#### Cleat Hitches

One of the simplest knots, certainly the most used aboard a boat, involves nothing more than turns around a cleat. You may not have even thought of this as a knot—but it is. When fastening a line to a cleat, as with many things at sea, a small error at the start can cause problems later.

Look closely at the illustrations, this page, and see how the dock line at the far left comes in at an angle to the base of the cleat. It then goes around the base of the cleat so that it passes under each horn once. This keeps the strain low on the cleat. The cleat should be mounted so that it is at a slight angle to the expected direction of strain.

Even half a turn, plus a firm hold on the line, usually creates enough friction to hold a boat at a dock until the whole turn can be completed. In fact, you should always take a half turn around a cleat when a load is coming on the line; this is an essential part of good line handling called snubbing. Never try to hold a load-bearing line in your bare hands—it can slip and seriously burn your fingers and palm. You will see that in the illustration on this page the snubbing is nearly a whole turn; notice also that the crossover that will make the figure eight should be made after the line goes around both horns of the cleat.

One and a half or two figure eights are enough; more would add no security and just take time to undo later.

There are two ways to complete the hitches on a cleat: you can leave the last turn free, perhaps keeping it under your eye if it is a jib sheet, for example. In this way the line can be instantly thrown off if necessary.

For more security you can turn the last hitch over so it is tightened to bind against itself. This might be best for a dock line or halyard but is not safe if instant release may be necessary. In a small sailboat in puffy winds, you probably wouldn’t cleat the main sheet all the way—you’d take one turn and hold it tight in your hand.

Similar figure-eight turns are sometimes used on mooring bitts.

#### Using the Right Knot

The knots described and shown in detail on this page, in the sidebar “Most-Used Knots on Board Recreational Boats,” can be divided into two groups: basic knots used generally on boats, and a few specialized knots that come in handy at certain times.

You have seen that some knots are echoes of others and that more than one knot is sometimes used for the same purpose. Here are some reasons: A knot may work well with rough-textured rope but tend to slip when tied with slippery synthetic line. One knot may work well with small line, while another works out better with heavier and stiffer line. The sheet bend can be tied in a hurry; it takes more time to make two bowlines when tying two lines of the same diameter together. The advantage of one bowline with half the sheet bend tied into it (a double becket bend) is that it can be unfastened quickly.

Some potential problems are most easily solved by alternate methods. An anchor bend, for example, is customarily given some extra security with a short seizing or a constrictor knot made with sail twine; see Figure 23-11, left. On other occasions, where the knot won’t be in use for as long a time as an anchor line might be, the free end can be passed through a strand of laid line (see Figure 23-11, center), or an extra half hitch can be used; see Figure 23-11, right—a clove hitch with an extra half hitch or two half hitches.

Figure 23-11 Twine seizing, left, can be used to give extra security to an anchor bend. A variation, center, is to pass the free end through a strand of the standing part. A clove hitch, right, is better secured if it is finished with a half-hitch (or two) around the standing part of the line.

#### Effect on Strength

The use of knots (and splices) reduces the overall strength of any line—be aware of this, and select a size of line that provides adequate strength for the use to which it is put. Factors that are to be applied to the basic working load of a line to account for the use of knots and splices are listed in Table 23-2.

## SPLICES & SPLICING

Most stock sailboats are delivered with all the rigging supplied; it is not until something new is added or something old is replaced that a splice is even thought about. Power and sailing craft may have a made-up anchor line (usually not as long as it should be) but probably will not have enough dock lines. Marine dealers often sell dock lines of various lengths already made up, or you may want to make your own. A sailmaker will often be a good source for new jib sheets, other lines, or small stuff. But in spite of the fact that many boat owners do not need to do much splicing, it is a good idea to know the basics. You can be a wise customer, and you can make the occasional emergency repair if you know the rudiments of splicing.

Splicing, like knotting, is a finger art. In small to moderate sizes of laid ropes you can make splices without tools, although a knife and fid are extremely helpful. If you are splicing heavier line or braided line, simple tools are necessary—a fid or marlinespike for laid line, and a special fid for braided line.

#### Splicing Principles

As you can easily see in the illustrations of Figure 23-12, or by looking at a splice that is already made in laid line, the principle is simple: Three strands are tucked over and under so that they interweave with three other strands. If you are splicing the ends of two lines together in a short splice, the result is obviously thicker. A short splice, therefore, won’t go through a block of the correct size for the diameter of the line. A long splice is the solution—part of each strand is taken out and the tapered result makes a thin splice (with less strength). Most boat owners, however, would replace a broken line rather than splice it.

### Short Splice

The best way to learn how to make a short splice is to start to make one! The sequence of actions is shown and described in Figure 23-12, A through E. A slightly modified beginning is shown in Figure 23-12, F.

Figure 23-12 The five steps of a short splice are shown above, A through E. An alternative beginning is shown at F.

To start a short splice, unlay the strands of both rope ends for a short distance, about ten turns of the lay. Tape or fuse the six strands, or whip them, to prevent unlaying. A seizing is often made around each of the ropes, or each is wrapped with a piece of tape, to prevent strands from unlaying too far. These seizings or tape will be cut as the splice is completed.

Next, “marry” the ends so that the strands of each rope lie alternately between strands of the other as shown. Now tie all three strands of one rope temporarily to the other—this is desirable, but not essential.

Working with the three free strands, remove temporary seizing from around the other rope and splice the strands into it by tucking the loose strands over and under successive strands against the lay of the rope. When first tucks have been made, snug down all three strands. Then tuck two or three more times on that side.

Next cut the temporary seizing of the other strands and the rope and repeat, splicing these three remaining strands into the opposite rope.

This shows how the short splice would appear if not tapered, after trimming off the ends of strands. Never cut the ends too close; otherwise, when a heavy strain is put on the rope, the last tuck tends to work out.

An alternative to the short splice technique shown in Steps A through E, which some find easier, is to start as in Step A and tie pairs of strands from opposite ends in an overhand knot. This, in effect, makes the first tuck.

### Eye Splice

Although the short splice is the easiest to learn, an eye splice is much more often needed. An eye splice is most useful in one end, sometimes both ends, of a dock line. A good practice is to make the eye about three times larger than the size of any piling or bollard that is likely to be used. The reason: a too-small eye splice, under strain, tends to pull apart at its throat.

The same principle as in a short splice—interweaving—applies; see Figure 23-13. But there is one point where an error is easily made; note Figure 23-13, B, very carefully.

Figure 23-13 An eye splice forms a permanent loop in the end of a line. It may be made around a thimble to guard against chafe (as occurs on an anchor line), or as a larger eye without a thimble for use as a dock line. See text for step-by-step instructions.

Start the eye splice by unlaying the strands of the free end six to ten turns of lay. Now tape or heat-seal the end of each strand to prevent its unlaying while being handled; whipping can be applied to the strand ends, but this action is rarely done as this is only a temporary intermediate action if the ends are to be tapered. It is sometimes helpful to place tape around the unlaid strands every 4 to 6 inches to maintain the “turn” in the strand.

Next form a loop in the line by laying the end back along the standing part. Hold the standing part away from you in the left hand, loop toward you. The unlaid end can be worked with the right hand.

The size of loop is determined by the point X (Figure 23-13, A) where the opened strands are first tucked under the standing part of the line. If the splice is being made around a thimble, the line is laid snugly in the thimble groove and point X will be at the tapered end of the thimble. The line may be temporarily taped or tied into the thimble until the job is finished.

Now lay the three opened strands across the standing part as shown in Figure 23-13, A, so that the center strand b lies over and directly along the standing part. Left-hand strand a leads off to the left, right-hand strand c to the right of the standing part.

Tucking of strand ends, a, b, and c under the three strands of the standing part is the next step. Get this right and the rest is easy.

Always start with the center strand b. Select the topmost strand 2 of the standing part near point X and tuck b under it. Pull it up snug, but not so tight as to distort the natural lay of all strands. Note that the tuck is made against the lay of the standing part.

Now take left-hand strand a and pass it over strand 2 and then tuck it under strand 1. Similarly, take strand c and tuck under strand 3, which lies to the right of strand 2. Be sure to tuck from right to left in every case.

The greatest risk of starting wrong is in the first tuck of strand c. It should go under 3, from right to left and look like the drawing in Figure 23-13, B. The way you do it is to flop the whole thing over in your hands before making the tuck of strand c. You’ll notice only one free strand (that’s c) untucked, and only one of the original strands in the standing part that doesn’t have a strand under it. Be sure you make the third tuck in the right direction; see Figure 23-13, B.

If the first tuck of each of strands, a, b, and c is correctly made, the splice at this point will look as shown in Figure 23-13, C.

The splice is completed by making at least three additional tucks with each of strands a, b, and c. As each added tuck is made be sure it passes over one strand of the standing part, then under the strand next above it, and so on, the tucked strand running against the lay of the strands of the standing part. This is clearly shown in Figure 23-13, D, after the first three tucks have been made. Note that c, c1, and c2, are the same strand as it appears after each of the three successive tucks.

Suggestions The splice can be made neater by tapering. This is done by cutting out part of the yarns from the tucking strands before the finishing tucks. In any case, the first four tucks in synthetic line are made with full strands. (Four tucks are necessary, as synthetics are often slippery.) After that, some experienced skippers prefer to cut out about a third of each strand and make one last tuck. This produces an even taper. After the splice is finished, roll it on deck under foot to smooth it up. Then put a strain on it and finally cut off the projecting ends of the strands. Do not cut off the “tails” too short. If desired, a seizing can be applied at the throat of the splice.

The loose fibers at the end of each strand can be fused with a rope-cutting tool such as a soldering gun, or with a flame, but be careful not to melt or set fire to the rope.

• The eye splice is often made on a metal or plastic thimble. When used this way it is necessary to work the splice very tightly, and it is almost always desirable to add a seizing, using a needle and waxed nylon twine or tape (see instructions for whipping on this page).

• Another way to make a synthetic rope splice tight is to place it in boiling water so that the rope shrinks.

• In all splicing, carefully relaying the rope—so that every strand is under the same even tension—is important.

• It is important to insert the thimble or other captive fitting into your splice before finalizing it. This is often forgotten when making an eye splice, even by experts.

### Back Splice

One other splice is seen occasionally on boats: the back splice at the end of a line. This makes a good, neat finish to a line, but it has a major disadvantage: If you want to unreeve the line at the end of the season, or to replace it, the back splice probably won’t go through the blocks; see Figure 23-14. A well-made whipping makes an equally neat finish (refer to Figures 23-20 and 23-21). You can tie a figure eight or Ashley stopper knot to keep the end from going through a block when you don’t want it to.

Figure 23-14 A back splice is started by bringing each strand over the one to its left, and under the next one, as in A. The strands are then tucked as shown in B and C for at least three tucks each. Longer strands can be used and trimmed in thirds (after the basic tucks) to provide a tapered finish.

### Splicing Double-Braided Line

An eye splice in double braid looks difficult—but is relatively simple to learn. The technique has almost nothing to do with other kinds of splicing—it is just a logical way to use the cover and core of the braided line. A thimble can be inserted during the splicing process. The eight steps of the procedure are described, with explanatory illustrations that show how special tools are used, in Figures 23-15a through 23-15h, on this page.

Figure 23-15A Tightly tape end with one layer of tape. Mark a big dot one fid length from end of line, and from this dot form a loop the size of the eye you want. Mark an X where the loop meets the dot.

Figure 23-15B Bend the line sharply at X and spread the strands apart firmly to make an opening so the center can be pried out. Mark one big line on the center where it comes out (this is Mark #1) and use your fingers to pull all the center out of the cover from X to the end. Pull on the paper tape inside the cover until it breaks back at the slip knot and pull it out. Put a layer of tape on center end.

Figure 23-15C Pull out more of the center. From Mark #1 measure a distance equal to the short section of the fid, and mark two heavy lines (this is Mark #2). Mark #3 is three heavy lines at a distance of one fid length plus one short section of the fid from Mark #2.

Figure 23-15D Insert fid into center at Mark #2, and slide it lengthwise through “tunnel” until point comes out at Mark #3.

Figure 23-15E Cut across taped end of cover to form a point, and retape tightly with one layer of tape. Jam this point into open end of the fid; jam pusher into fid behind the tape. Hold center gently at Mark #3 and push both fid and cover through center until dot almost disappears at Mark #2.

Figure 23-15F Note how center tail must travel through the cover. It must go in close to dot, and come out through the opening at X. On large eyes several passes may be needed for fid to reach X. When this occurs, simply reinsert fid at the point it came out and continue to X. To start, insert fid in cover at dot and slide it through tunnel to X. Form a tapered point on center tail, jam it into the open end of fid, and push fid and center through the cover. After fid comes out at X, pull all center tail through cover until tight, then pull cover tail tight.

Figure 23-15G Unravel cover tail braid all the way to Mark #3, and cut off groups of strands at staggered intervals to form a tapered end. Hold loop at crossover in one hand, and firmly smooth both sides of loop away from crossover. Do this until the tapered tail disappears inside Mark #3.

Figure 23-15H Hold rope at slipknot, and gently begin to “milk,” or slide, the cover slack toward the loop. You’ll see the center begin to disappear into the cover. Go back to the knot, and continue sliding more cover firmly until all center and the crossover are buried.

### Splicing Line to Wire Rope & Chain

Splices in wire rope, best left to professionals, and wire-to-rope, surely left to professionals, use techniques somewhat similar to laid rope splices, but differing in details.

Anchor lines (rodes) that use a combination of three-strand nylon line and chain are common (see Chapter 9). These can join an eye splice in the line to a link of the chain by use of a shackle, but only if a windlass is not used. If a windlass is used, the line must be spliced to the chain in order that the junction will pass smoothly over the drum. This is frequently left to a professional, but should be within the capability of a boater who has some splicing experience. The technique used is much like a combination of an eye splice and a back splice. Two strands of the line are passed through the end link of the chain in one direction, and the other strand is passed through the same link in the opposite direction. Strands are then interwoven in a manner common to all splices, taking care that they are pulled up snuggly and are tapered off at the finish of the splice.

## CARE & MAINTENANCE OF LINES

The many lines on your craft not only represent a significant financial investment, they are also important safety equipment. Taking the proper care of them will lengthen their lives and postpone the day when they have to be replaced. Proper care will also ensure that they have their full rated strength when they are used; see Figure 23-16.

Figure 23-16 The way that lines are handled and stowed is an indication of the way that a boat is cared for generally.

### Routine Care for Lines

The various lines on your boat will serve you better and last longer if they are used properly and are given continuing attention.

Keep Lines Clean. Dirt, sand, oil, and acids are destructive to synthetic rope. To wash rope, put it in a mesh bag or pillowcase—that way it won’t foul up your washing machine. Mild washing power should be used, and a bit of fabric softener may be added.

Don’t Let It Kink. Kinking (hockling) of a line is not only annoying, but it can also result in problems that lead to breakage. Sometimes coiling new three-strand rope first against the lay (counterclockwise), and then with the lay (clockwise) helps to get it so it will coil and run smoothly. Rope, including braided rope, should be taken off its original spool in a direct unwinding pull—not looped off over the top of the spool. As mentioned earlier, larger, stiffer ropes may need different handling from small, flexible lines. Double-braid and laid line can develop a twist when run in and out on winches. This can lead to kinking. Overhaul the line and take out the twist as needed.

Guard against Chafing & Abrasion. You can use a leather or plastic chafe guard, which is preferable, or, if your line is small enough, one of the kind made from split garden hose. You can whip or serve (by wrapping line of a smaller size around the line to take the wear) a place in a dock line that goes over a gunwale or through a chock. Using small braided tape or cord is good for such a whipping, because if it wears through it breaks and you can see it. Special chafing tape is also available.

Some skippers prewhip dock lines and anchor lines at a number of convenient places and then adjust the lines so the whippings will be in the chocks.

When at anchor, you should “change the nip” on the rode periodically, letting out or taking in a short length; don’t let the wear come on the same place over an extended time.

Avoid Friction Damage. Slipping on a power winch or windlass can result in friction heat that will damage a line.

Use the Right Size Line in a Proper Manner. A line that jams in a block can tear itself apart. Heavy strains that do not break a rope can nevertheless weaken it. Both continual stretching and sudden shocks are damaging.

### Maintenance for Lines

Maintenance of the lines on board a boat should be an ongoing procedure, but such action should be supplemented by a complete annual or semiannual inspection of all lines, those in use and those merely waiting to be used

Make Small Repairs Promptly. If an eye splice is coming undone or a whipping breaks, fix it with care before relying on that line again. An incomplete eye splice can be dangerous, and an unwhipped line end will keep right on coming apart until it is fixed.

Inspect Your Lines & Rigging. Inspection of rope means unlaying a number of strands, looking for broken fibers. Frayed strands, powdered fibers inside the rope, and stiffness are the signs of serious deterioration. In addition, you should go over the entire length of line, looking for cuts and nicks, exterior signs of abrasion, and burns.

A slight abrasion fuzz on synthetic line, laid or braided, acts as a protective cushion. Pulled or cut strands in braided line are more serious; they can affect 2 percent or more of the line strength for each strand involved.

Eye splices should be inspected inside and out for distortion of the thimbles as well as a tendency for the splice to come undone. Whipping and servings, of course, should be inspected regularly for excessive wear, so they can be renewed. Several times a season, halyards should get a special inspection where they run through the block at the masthead when in use: The small motion, always in the same place around the block, plus sharp bends in the line, can lead to breakdowns. Because of this, anyone who has had a sail drop suddenly in a strong wind knows the wisdom of checking halyards.

Any three-strand lines that have had severe kinks, or hockles, can be assumed to have lost 30 percent of their strength. Never use force to straighten a kink. Instead, turn the line in your hands or trail it astern.

An old-fashioned cure for wear on a line is still useful with synthetic rope: reversing the line end for end. In other cases a small repair, a whipping to take the chafing, or a slight shortening of the line to make a new eye splice may be the cure.

## BLOCKS & TACKLE

The use of a block and tackle (sometimes pronounced “tay-kle”)—or, to use a higher-sounding name, mechanical appliance—on board small craft is most often found on sailboats. On powerboats, such gear is generally limited to the lowering and hoisting aboard of dinghies and tenders. Nonetheless, any boater should have a basic knowledge of it, as its use enables one man to do the work of many.

Blocks and tackle are used where hoisting sails, as well as setting them, requires some means for one or two people to provide the strength of many. No matter how small the sailboat, the sheets usually run through one or more blocks, meaning there is a mechanical appliance providing a mechanical advantage. To see how beneficial this is, go sailing in a 20-foot boat in a moderate breeze, and bend a line to the boom. While underway, attempt to trim in the sail with your improvised sheet. It will come in, but it will be a struggle; repeat the exercise with the regular system of blocks and tackle, and you will see with what ease the sail comes in.

### Terminology

A block consists of a frame of wood or metal inside of which is fitted one or more sheaves (pulleys)—the word is pronounced “shiv”—and is designated according to the number of sheaves it contains, such as single, double, or triple; see Figure 23-17. The size of the block to be used is determined by the size of the rope that will run through it. If a fiber rope is being used, the size of the block should be about three times the circumference of the rope and the sheave diameter about twice the circumference. Therefore, for ⅝-inch diameter rope (about 2 inches in circumference), the block could be 6 inches (three times the circumference) and the sheave diameter 4 inches (twice the circumference). This is an approximation; see Table 23-3 for recommended block sizes and rope diameters. Today, blocks are designed for a narrow range of line sizes. Choosing the maximum possible diameter of sheave will help to reduce friction, thereby extending the life of lines and equipment.

Figure 23-17 The various component parts of a double-sheave block are identified in the above sketch.

Table 23-3 Matching rope and block sizes.

Wire rope is also used for running rigging, but usually only as halyard leads on sailboats. This should be stainless steel and sheaves should be as large as possible for long rope life. Make sure the rope cannot be squeezed between the sheave and the sideplate (also called the cheek or shell) of the block, or your line may become jammed.

The term tackle is used for an assemblage of falls (lines) and blocks. When you pass a rope through the blocks, you reeve it, and the part of the fall made fast to one of the blocks, or to the load, as the case may be, is known as the standing part, while the end upon which the force is to be applied is called the hauling part. To overhaul the falls is to separate the blocks; to round in is to bring them together; and chock-a-block or two-blocked means they are positioned tight together.

### Types of Tackle

Tackles are named in several ways: according to the number of sheaves in the blocks that are used (single, two-fold, three-fold purchases); according to the purpose for which the tackle is used; or by names handed down from the past (luff tackles, watch tackles, gun tackles, Spanish burtons, etc.); see Figure 23-18. The tackles that may be found aboard cruising boats are now generally classified by ratio, as below:

Figure 23-18 These are some of the various tackles that are used on boats and ships.

Ratio 1 to 1. Traditionally called a single whip, this is a single fixed block and fall. There is no gain in power—the gain is only in height of lift or change in direction of pull.

Ratio 2 to 1 or 3 to 1. Traditionally called a gun tackle, this consists of two single blocks. If lower block is movable, double force is gained. If upper block is movable, triple force is gained.

Ratio 3 to 1 or 4 to 1. Traditionally called a luff tackle, this consists of a double block and a single block. The force gained is three if the single block is movable, four if the double block is movable.

Ratio 4 to 1 or 5 to 1. Traditionally called a two-fold or double tackle, this consists of two double sheave blocks. Force gained is four or five, depending upon block movement.

### Calculating the Power of a Tackle

The force gained in all these tackle combinations is theoretical only, as the friction of the blocks is ignored. The usual method of compensating for this friction, and calculating the actual force required, is to add 5 percent to the weight of the object (W) for each sheave in the tackle before dividing by the number of falls (with modern gear, this may be a bit on the conservative side). For example: in the two-fold purchase of Figure 23-18, if the weight of the drum is 500 pounds, 5 percent is 25 pounds; 4 sheaves x 25 pounds = 100 pounds. Thus the total W to be considered is 500 + 100 = 600 pounds. With four falls, the force needed to lift the drum would be 600 ÷ 4 or 150 pounds, rather than the theoretical 125 pounds if friction was disregarded—a significant difference. The actual friction will vary with the type of bearings and pins, state of lubrication, and sheave diameter.

There are a number of other purchases, the heaviest commonly used aboard ship being a three-fold purchase, which consists of two triple blocks.

It must be remembered that the hauling part on a three-part block should be reeved around the center sheave. If this is not done, the block will cant, causing it to bind, and in extreme cases to break.

##### BLOCK MAINTENANCE

Maintenance for a block relates closely to its construction. Older blocks needed grease to ease friction. Today’s use of synthetics and precision machining provides a product that is almost maintenance free. Maintenance is now reduced to the following: Inspect periodically for fatigue, in particular for cracked or elongated shackles. Rinse often with fresh water to keep clean, and if lubrication is needed, a dry lubricant will usually suffice.

Avoid leaving heavy tools on blocks when not in use. This may slightly deform the bearings.

Sheaves are now designed to accommodate the following: wire only, wire-rope combination (halyards), Kevlar and Spectra line with a special configuration that allows the line to flatten to avoid stress concentration, and ratchet sheaves with their many-sided design that grips sheets tenaciously but allows line to be eased smoothly.

Large boats’ sheaves and blocks generally come in three types of bearing systems:

• Ball bearings for the freest running system; they have the lowest load-carrying ability.

• Roller bearings can carry more load, but they have more friction at low loads. Combinations of ball and roller bearing give a free rolling system for loads that are moderate to high.

• Bushings impregnated with Teflon, combined with side-load balls, are used for loads too high even for roller bearings. These produce more friction than balls or rollers at low loads. Good examples are: masthead sheaves, runner block sheaves, wire sheaves, and steering cable sheaves. Most blocks previously had a friction load of approximately 5 percent per sheave. Today’s technology has brought it down to as low as 2 percent per sheave.

## AT THE BITTER END

If a piece of rope is cut, it will start to fray and unravel at the end—sometimes in seconds; see Figure 23-19, A and B. If it is taped before cutting, or if the cutting is done with an electric cutter that melts the fibers, the end won’t fray, at least not immediately.

Figure 23-19 The ends of three-strand or braided line can be taped, dipped, or whipped to prevent unlaying. Also shown is the wall-and-crown, a good-looking finish that combines two separate knots, and the manrope knot, a doubled wall-and-crown.

#### Taping or Dipping

But the end of a line still needs protection for almost any use. There are a variety of ways that a line can be protected; some are good if you’re in a hurry, some fit one situation relating to line handling, others are right for different purposes.

A careful taping of the end of a line is useful but hardly looks seamanlike; one might say it’s a good way to handle a coil of spare rope that you’re storing in a locker before putting it to use; see Figure 23-19, C. A rope end with adhesive tape is at least ready for a more sophisticated finish later.

The air-drying liquid plastics mentioned earlier can also be used for rope ends and may make color coding possible; see Figure 23-19, D.

#### Whipping

Braided and double-braided line is more difficult to finish with a traditional yet functional end. An eye splice on a braided dock line is an obviously correct solution for one end—this end is protected and the eye splice is ready to use. On the other end, a whipping, Figure 23-19, E, preferably one made very tight with a sailmaker’s needle, results in a usable finish.

With laid line, however, the marlinespike arts of the sailor provide more opportunity. A variety of whippings, knots, or a back splice are among the choices.

To make a plain whipping, you need the right size of waxed nylon twine or lacing and your hands; see Figure 23-20.

Figure 23-20 To make a plain whipping, begin at least 1 inch from the bitter end. Lay a loop of cord across the line, leaving a tail of 5 or 6 inches on the bitter end, A. Then with the working piece of cord, wrap around the line from the trail end toward the apex of the loop, B. To finish off the whipping, insert the working end of the cord through the loop. Pull on the bitter end of the cord until the loop slides completely out of sight, then clip the ends closely, C.

A far better whipping, called a sailmaker’s whipping, requires a palm and sailmaker’s needle, as well as the cord or lacing twine; see Figure 23-21 for instructions. This whipping will last longer as well as look better.

Figure 23-21 A sailmaker’s whipping is started by stitching the cord through the line, A. Wind six or more turns around the line, B, and stitch back through it. Then bring the cord back over the turns along a groove between the strands. Stitch through a strand to the next groove, and bring the cord back along this. Stitch through the next strand to the final groove, C, and finish with a square knot in the cord.

#### Ending with a Splice or Knot

A standard way to make a good-looking end for a line—provided it doesn’t have to go through a block—is a back splice. Properly tapered, perhaps polished off with a little extra whipping, it will last a long time; refer to Figure 23-14.

Two fancier rope ends, from many that are available, are illustrated here without instructions. You can learn to make them—as you can learn other ornamental and useful knots and rope work—in any of several advanced books on marlinespike seamanship.

• The wall-and-crown (see Figure 23-19, F) is a good-looking finish that combines two simple knots.

• The manrope knot is really a doubled wall-and-crown (see Figure 23-19, G). Finished with a back splice, it looks good on the end of a bucket rope—and helps you hold the bucket.

WEATHER

The Basic Forces That Make Weather • Clouds • Fog • Highs & Lows Air Masses & Fronts • Storms & Severe Weather • Forecasts & How to Get Information • Weather Observing & Weather Proverbs

Weather is an important element of your boating; it can add to or detract from your enjoyment, and it can have a vital bearing on your safety.

A boater needs three different types of weather information: current or “nowcast” conditions showing what the weather is actually like; “forecast” conditions of how the weather is expected to change over a given period lasting from an hour or two to several days; and climatic or “normal” conditions used in planning to determine the type of weather usually to be expected during your time on the water. You need not be qualified as a weather forecaster, but you must be able to obtain up-to-date information and apply that information to your plans. You must be alert to and correctly interpret local weather signs—wind shifts, changes in cloud patterns, or ocean swells.

### What Makes the Weather

Weather doesn’t just happen; there are basic causes and effects. An appreciation of these influences will lead to a better understanding of weather systems and their movement. This is the basis for weather forecasting.

#### The Earth’s Atmosphere

The earth is enveloped in its atmosphere—a constantly changing, fluid-like mixture of gases, mostly nitrogen and oxygen—that extends upward with decreasing density for many miles. Half of all this air is in the lower 3.5 miles (5.6 km). From a weather standpoint, we are usually concerned only with that portion which lies below about 10 miles (16 km).

The atmosphere consists of several layers. The lowest layer (troposphere) is the most important for weather. The tropopause at the top of the troposphere generally acts as a cap separating tropospheric from higher air.

The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, averaging 11 miles (18 km) at the equator but only 5 miles (8 km) above the poles. This is the area that contains our weather systems, and most of our clouds.

#### Heat from the Sun

Although the sun is some 93 million miles (150 million km) away, and only an infinitesimal fraction of its energy falls on the earth; this is enough to make the earth habitable and establish our climate and weather patterns. About 29 percent of the sun’s energy is reflected back into space by the atmosphere. The atmosphere absorbs 19 percent, and 52 percent is soaked up by the earth. Of that 52 percent, energy will be absorbed or reflected depending on the surface at a location: dark or light, rough or smooth, land or water, plant covered or barren. These differences result in the climatic variations seen around the earth. Solar radiation that is absorbed by the earth’s surface is reradiated as heat rays of longer wavelength. Depending on cloud cover, some of this energy can be trapped in the lower atmosphere in much the same way air in a greenhouse is warmed to grow plants—hence the much talked about “greenhouse” effect; see Figure 24-01.

Figure 24-01 The sun’s rays encounter layers of gases in the atmosphere that either stop the rays, reflect them, or let them through. Only about half of the sun’s radiated energy reaches the earth’s surface, where it is reflected or absorbed and partially reradiated.

The atmosphere moderates the sun’s effect, filtering out excess (and harmful) rays by day, and holding in heat at night. Without our atmosphere, we would have to cope with extremes like those on the moon, +212° Fahrenheit (F) or more in sunlight, -233° F or less in darkness (+100 to -147° Celsius [C]). Clouds directly affect the cooling of the air at night as they reflect back a portion of the heat rising from the earth’s surface; on clear nights, more heat is lost.

## CLOUDS

The most visible manifestation of weather is clouds; winds and temperature can be felt, but not seen. Many cloud patterns are not only beautiful and interesting to watch, but they can also be meaningful in interpreting weather conditions and trends.

#### Moisture in the Air

There is more water in the air than you might think; it evaporates from the oceans, lakes, and rivers and can exist in the air in any of three physical states—vapor, liquid, and solid. A term you will often hear is relative humidity—the amount of water vapor present in the air as a percentage of the maximum possible amount for air at that temperature. This maximum amount decreases with a decrease in temperature. The relative humidity of a mass of air increases as its temperature falls, even though the actual amount of moisture is unchanged. When air is cooled after the relative humidity reaches 100 percent, some moisture condenses into a visible form. The temperature at which this occurs is the dew point.

##### DESCRIBING WATER VAPOR CONTENT

• Condensation A process in which a gas changes to a liquid, as from steam to water.

• Dew point The temperature at which air would become saturated if cooled at constant pressure.

• Evaporation A process in which a liquid turns to a vapor without its temperature reaching the boiling point.

• Relative humidity The actual amount of water vapor in the air divided by the amount of water vapor that would be present if the air were saturated at the same temperature and pressure. It is expressed as a percentage.

Dew point indicates indirectly the amount of water vapor present, while relative humidity expresses the degree of saturation. Therefore, air that has a temperature and dew point of 75°F and 50°F respectively contains more water vapor than air with a temperature and dew point of 45°F and 45°F respectively. However, the relative humidity is higher in the latter case.

• Saturation The point at which air will not absorb more moisture. The higher the temperature, the more water vapor the air can hold before it becomes saturated.

• Sublimation Conversion directly from a solid to a vapor or vice versa without going through the liquid state.

#### Formation of Clouds

When air moves upward (e.g., moving over mountains, moving over domes of colder air, or moving upward in cumuloform clouds), it expands and cools. As it cools, the relative humidity increases until the air becomes saturated and clouds are formed. There may also be precipitation in the form of rain (liquid) or snow, sleet, or hail (solid). (When this saturation occurs at or very near the surface, this is fog. The various types of fog and the circumstances of their formation are discussed in detail on this page.)

Cooling can also come with horizontal air movement. For example, air cools when moving from warmer water surfaces to cooler land surfaces. Again, when air cools to the dew point, clouds form and precipitation can fall.

### Types of Clouds

There is an international system of cloud classification. Cloud types have names based mainly on appearance. They may sometimes be classified by the process of formation. One having “cirro” in its name is a high cloud. One with “alto” is a middle cloud. One with “nimbo” is a precipitating cloud. A cloud with “strato” in its name is layered. One with “cumulo” has vertical development. Ten basic types are seen in Figures 24-02 (a-u).

#### High Clouds

High clouds are found above about 18,000 to 20,000 feet (5,500 to 6,000 m) and are composed of ice crystals. Their various types are described below; see Figures 24-02, a–f.

Figure 24-02a Cirrostratus covers the entire sky, with some thicker patches of altostratus below it. As cirrus clouds thicken, the lower portions become water droplets.

Figure 24-02b Cirrocumulus cloud puffs are smaller in apparent size than the sun or moon, which they would not obscure.

Figure 24-02c Cirrostratus is a high veil of ice crystal cloud through which the sun can be seen, along with a well-defined halo; it may herald an approaching storm system.

Figure 24-02d Ground haze, mixed with industrial smog, dissipates in morning sunlight, which is not blocked by a thick layer of cirrostratus cloud.

Figure 24-02e Cirrocumulus clouds are heavier and thicker than cirrus, but still without shading. Small elements may be more or less arranged in repeating patterns.

Figure 24-02f Cirrus are high, thin clouds, either in white filaments or patches and narrow bands. They may have a fibrous (hair-like) appearance or a silky sheen, or both.

Cirrus (Ci) Detached clouds in the form of white, delicate filaments, patches, or narrow bands. Often called “mares’ tails,” these clouds have a fibrous (hair-like) appearance, or a silky sheen, or both. Experienced boaters will often use wispy cirrus clouds as the first sign that an approaching cold front will arrive in about 24 hours.

Cirrocumulus (Cc) Thin, white patch, sheet, or layer of cloud, without shading, composed of very small elements. These elements are in the form of grains or ripples, merged or separate, and more or less regularly arranged. Most of the elements have an apparent width of less than one degree of arc.

Cirrostratus (Cs) Transparent, whitish cloud veil of fibrous (hair-like) or smooth appearance, totally or partly covering the sky, and generally producing halos around the sun or the moon.

#### Middle Clouds

Middle clouds are found from about 7,000 feet up to 18,000-20,000 feet (2,000 up to 5,500–6,000 m). These are water droplet clouds and are described below; see Figures 24-02, g–i.

Figure 24-02g Altocumulus—white or gray, or both—often appears in regular patterns across large areas of the sky. The pattern above is called a “mackerel sky.”

Figure 24-02h Altostratus represents warm air riding over cold air ahead of a warm front. The layer will grow thicker and lower with time, bringing continuous rain or snow.

Figure 24-02i More altostratus that covers the entire sky, with widely scattered stratocumulus beneath it. This followed a day of warm, hazy sunshine in late May.

Altocumulus (Ac) White or gray (or both white and gray) patch, sheet, or layer of cloud, generally with shading, composed of layers, rounded masses, rolls, etc., which are sometimes partly fibrous or diffuse, and which may or may not be merged. Most of the regularly arranged small elements have an apparent width of between one and five degrees of arc.

Altostratus (As) Grayish or bluish cloud sheet or layer of striated, fibrous, or uniform appearance, totally or partly covering the sky, and having parts thin enough to reveal the sun at least vaguely, as through ground glass. Altostratus does not show halo phenomena.

#### Low Clouds

Low clouds, described below, are found from near ground up to about 7,000 feet (2,000 m); see Figures 24-02, j–l.

Figure 24-02j Nimbostratus, just prior to the onset of a steady rainfall. If the sun were in the picture, its image would be blurred and there would be no halo.

Figure 24-02k Stratus has a thick, almost uniform look. This indicates stable air, and as there is little turbulence in this, any precipitation will be fine drizzle.

Figure 24-02l Stratocumulus is white with dark patches in thick portions of the clouds. This type may appear as rounded masses or rolls that may or may not be merged.

Nimbostratus (Ns) Gray cloud layer, often dark, the appearance of which is rendered diffuse by more or less continuously falling rain or snow, which in most cases reaches the ground. These clouds are thick enough throughout to blot out the sun. Low, ragged clouds frequently occur below the layer, with which they may or may not merge.

Stratocumulus (Sc) Gray or whitish (or both gray and whitish), patch, sheet, or layer cloud. These almost always have dark parts, composed of tessellations (covering without gaps), rounded masses, or rolls, which are nonfibrous (except for “virga”—precipitation trails) and which may or may not be merged. Most of the regularly arranged elements have an apparent width of more than five degrees of arc.

Stratus (St) Generally gray cloud layer with a fairly uniform base, which may yield drizzle, ice prisms, or snow grains. When the sun is visible through the cloud, its outline is clearly discernible. Stratus does not produce halo phenomena (which is an ice crystal cloud effect) except, possibly, at very low temperatures. Sometimes stratus appears in the form of ragged patches.

#### Clouds of Vertical Development (Cumuloform)

As opposed to the clouds described above, which normally form in sheets or layers, there are clouds that have significant vertical extent. These develop with a significant rising action; see Figures 24-02, m–t.

Figure 24-02m Cumulus of little development indicate continued fair weather; following the passage of a cold front, they may be accompanied by brisk winds.

Figure 24-02n More fair-weather cumulus. If they form in warm air ahead of a cold front, however, they can be accompanied by squalls and thunderstorms.

Figure 24-02o Cumulonimbus base as a line of heavy thunderstorms approaches. Squall winds reached 50 knots in gusts, and the accompanying rain was torrential.

Figure 24-02p Cumulus clouds normally are associated with fair weather, but local hot spots and extreme development can change them into storm cumulonimbus.

Figure 24-02q Cumulus may build in the afternoon, but later in the day will flatten as the surface cools and the supply of rising warm, moist air diminishes.

Figure 24-02r Stratocumulus is a thick, solid layer with a lumpy base. It is often formed by the spreading out of cumulus and may be followed by clearing at night.

Figure 24-02s Cumulus development culminates in an anvil-topped cumulonimbus thunderhead that may tower 20,000 to 50,000 feet above the surface of the earth

Figure 24-02t Cumulonimbus associated with summer showers results from local developments of cumulus clouds. Rainfall is likely to be brief, but moderately heavy

Cumulus (Cu) Detached clouds, generally dense and with definite outlines, developing vertically in the form of rising mounds, domes, or towers, of which the bulging upper part often resembles a cauliflower. The upper sunlit parts are mostly brilliant white; their bases are relatively dark and horizontal. Sometimes cumulus is ragged.

Cumulonimbus (Cb) Heavy and dense cloud, with a considerable vertical extent in the form of a mountain or huge towers. This is a thunderstorm; see Figure 24-02s and this page. Depending where on the earth they form, the tops of these clouds may extend to over 50,000 ft (15.2 km). At least part of the upper portion is usually smooth, or fibrous or striated, and nearly always flattened. This part of a cumulonimbus cloud often spreads out in the shape of an anvil or vast plume. Under the base of this cloud, which is often very dark, there are frequently low ragged clouds, either merged with it or not, and precipitation.

Figure 24-02u Altostratus here is a thick, almost uniform cloud layer about 10,000 feet high. If this thickens and lowers, precipitation is on the way.

#### Variations

It should be noted that cloud groupings as above are not absolute or exclusive. For example, cumulonimbus often become midlevel altocumulus or altostratus, while the tops of these are high-level cirrus clouds

## FOG

Fog is merely a cloud whose base rests upon the earth, either land or water. It consists of water droplets that are suspended in the air. Each droplet is so small that it cannot be distinguished individually, yet present in such tremendous numbers that objects close at hand are obscured; see Figure 24-03.

Figure 24-03 Fog forms when warm, moist air is cooled to the point where the water vapor in it condenses out. Fog forms from the surface up; as successive layers of air are cooled enough to cause condensation, the depth of the fog increases.

If we are to have innumerable water droplets suspended in the air, there must be much water vapor already in that air. If droplets are to form from this vapor, the air must somehow be cooled so the vapor will condense. If the droplets are to condense in the air next to the earth, the cooling must take place at the surface of the earth. If the fog is to have any depth, successively higher layers of air must be cooled sufficiently to allow condensation in them also. Fog usually forms from the surface up. Thus, the land or water must be colder than the air next to it; and this must be colder than air above.

Air is said to be saturated with water vapor when its water vapor content would remain unchanged if it were placed above a level surface of pure water at its own temperature—it could absorb no more moisture. The amount of water vapor required to saturate a given volume of air depends on the temperature of the air, and increases as the temperature increases. (Remember, the higher the temperature, the more water vapor the air can hold before it becomes saturated.)

If a mass of air is originally in an unsaturated state, it can be saturated by cooling it down to a temperature at which its content of water vapor is the maximum containable amount, that is, to the dew-point temperature. Or it can become saturated by more water being caused to evaporate into it until it can hold no more. In this latter process, unsaturated air, as it passes over rivers and lakes, over the oceans or over wet ground, picks up water vapor and has its relative humidity raised. Also, rain falling from higher clouds will increase the amount of water vapor in unsaturated air near the earth.

### Types of Fog

As a boater, you can be affected by four types of fog: (1) radiation fog, formed in near-calm conditions by the cooling of nearby land on a clear night as a result of radiation of heat from the ground to the clear sky; (2) advection fog, formed by the flow of warm air over cold sea or lake; (3) steam fog, or sea smoke, formed when cold air blows over much warmer water; and (4) precipitation fog, formed when rain coming out of warm air aloft falls through a shallow layer of cold air at the earth’s surface.

Note that both steam fog and rain fog are basically the result of evaporation from relatively warm water, a process that increases the dew point. These fogs can be described as warm-surface fogs. On the other hand, radiation fog and advection fog can be considered cold-surface fogs.

There are also two other types of fog, but they are ones less likely to be a problem in boating: these are commonly referred to as upslope fog and ice fog.

#### Radiation Fog

There are four requirements for the formation of radiation fog (sometimes called ground fog). First, the air must be stable, and the air next to the earth must be colder than the air a short distance aloft. Second, the air must be relatively moist. Third, it must be night and the sky must be clear so that the earth readily can lose heat by radiation to outer space. The fourth requirement is that the wind must be light to calm.

The third requirement of the clear night sky enables the ground to become colder than the overlying air, which subsequently is cooled below its dew point both by contact with the ground (conduction of heat) and by radiative loss of heat to the ground. The characteristics of the fog developed vary with the degree of the fourth requirement of calmness. If there is a dead calm, the lowest strata of air will not mix with the ones above, and fog will likely form only to a height of 2 to 4 feet (0.6 to 1.2 m). If there is a slight motion of the air (a wind of three to five knots) and, hence, some turbulent mixing, the cooling is spread through a layer that may extend to a height of several hundred feet (perhaps 125 m) above the ground. With stronger winds, the cooling effect is distributed through so deep a layer that temperature does not fall to the dew point and fog does not form.

Radiation fog is most prevalent in middle and high latitudes; it can be predicted with considerable accuracy; see this page. It is local in character and occurs most frequently in valleys and lowlands, especially near lakes and rivers where you might be cruising. The cooled air drains into these terrain depressions; the lake or river aids the process of fog formation by contributing water vapor, which raises the dew point. Often there is dense radiation fog in narrow rivers and channels leading to a large body of water that is absent of fog away from shore.

This type of fog may be patchy or uniformly dense. It affects boaters mainly in the late summer or early autumn. Having formed at night, it will usually start to evaporate (“burn off”) over land shortly after sunrise. The lower layers are the first to go. It is slower to clear over water, however, since the temperature of the water warms less from night to day than does the land.

#### Advection Fog

Whereas radiation fog bothers boaters chiefly in the late summer and early autumn, advection fog can be a problem in any season. Advection means “transport by horizontal motion,” which relates to the production of this type of fog by winds carrying warm, moist air over a colder surface. The dew point of the air must be higher than the temperature of the surface over which the air is moving. The air can be cooled below its dew point by conduction and by radiation of heat to the colder surface. Other requirements for the formation of advection fog are: (a) the air at a height of 100 feet (30 m) or so must be warmer than the air just above the surface; and (b) the temperature of the surface—be it land or water—must become progressively colder in the direction toward which the air is moving. Advection fog may form day or night, in any season of the year, especially over the sea.

Coastal Fog For boaters, the most bothersome variety of advection fog is coastal fog. When steady winds blow landward and carry warm oceanic air across cold coastal water, the resulting fog may blanket a great length of coastline and, especially at night, may extend many miles inland up bays and rivers. It can be seen on land as it blows past streetlights. For example, consider the Pacific Coast, where the water close to the land is often colder than the water well offshore. The prevailing winds in summer are onshore and the air (which frequently has come from mid-Pacific) is usually nearly saturated with water vapor. The same thing happens when southerly winds carry air across the Gulf Stream and thence northward across the colder Atlantic coastal waters.

For inland boaters, advection fog may be a problem as it forms over large lakes whenever relatively warm and moist air is carried over their colder surfaces.

Advection fog is generally dissipated less easily than is radiation fog. Unlike radiation fog, sunshine usually has no effect on advection fog over water. Usually, a wind shift or a marked increase in wind velocity is required.

#### Precipitation Fog

When rain, after descending through a layer of warm air aloft, falls into a shallow layer of colder air at the earth’s surface, there will be some evaporation from the warm raindrops into the colder air. Under certain conditions, this will raise water vapor content of the cold air above the saturation point and precipitation fog, also called rain fog, will form. Because this type of fog is often found near frontal activity, it is sometimes known as frontal fog.

#### Steam Fog

On large rivers, such as the Mississippi or the Ohio, steam fog can be a particular hazard to late evening or early morning boating in the autumn. When cold air passes over much warmer water, the lowest layer of air is rapidly supplied with heat and water vapor. Mixing of this lowest layer with unmodified cold air above, can, under certain conditions, produce a supersaturated (foggy) mixture. Because the water is much warmer than the air, vertical air currents are created, and we observe the phenomenon of steaming, in much the same way as steam forms over a hot bath; see Figure 24-04.

Figure 24-04 Cold air passing over warm water picks up enough heat and moisture to form steam fog. It is most prevalent, morning and evening, during autumn months. It is found most often on inland rivers as well as small lakes and ponds.

Sea Smoke In winter when cold air below about 10°F (-12°C) blows off the land and across the adjacent coastal waters, steam fog may be widespread and very dense, and is then termed sea smoke; see Figure 24-05. Along North American coastal waters, steam fog occurs most frequently off the coasts of Maine and Nova Scotia, and in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, where it can be a serious navigational hazard. However, its occurrence is not restricted to the higher latitudes. Off the east coast of the U. S. it has been observed as far south as Florida, and it also occurs occasionally over the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

Figure 24-05 Sea smoke at Great Harbor, Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Water temperature at the time of this photograph was +31.6°F (-0.2°C), and the air temperature, 30 feet (9.1m) was +5°F(-15°C). The wind was from the northwest at about 20 knots.

#### Other Types of Fog

When a low, moving blanket of air is gradually elevated toward a cooler altitude by the slope of the land, “upslope fog” forms. Occurring frequently on the sides of mountains, this type of fog is common, for example, at New Hampshire’s Mount Washington and in the Great Plains, where a southeast wind blows moist air from the Gulf of Mexico toward the Rocky Mountains. If winds are too strong, however, stratus or stratocumulus clouds will form instead of fog.

At very low temperatures, usually below -25°F (-32°C), the air may become full of ice crystals. This “ice fog” can seriously restrict visibility. In this case, the water vapor in the air has turned directly into ice through the sublimation process.

### Distribution of Fog (Contiguous 48 States)

In the United States, the coastal sections most frequently beset by fog range from the Strait of Juan de Fuca to Point Arguello, California, on the Pacific Coast, and from the Bay of Fundy to Montauk Point, New York, on the Atlantic Coast. On these waters, the average annual number of hours of fog occurrence exceeds 900—more than 10 percent of the year. In the foggiest parts of these areas, off the coast of Northern California and the coast of Maine, fog is present about 20 percent of the year.

Going southward along both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, the frequency of fog decreases, more rapidly on the Atlantic Coast than on the Pacific. The average annual fog frequency over the waters near Los Angeles and San Diego, for example, is about three times that in the same latitude along the Atlantic Coast.

### Seasonal Frequencies

The time of maximum occurrence of fog off the Pacific Coast varies somewhat with the various localities and, of course, with the individual year. In general, however, over the stretch from Cape Flattery, Washington, to Point Arguello, the season of most frequent fog runs from July through October, with more than 50 percent of the annual number of foggy days occurring during these months. However, along the lower coast of California, from Los Angeles southward, the foggiest months are those from September through February, and the least foggy are from May through July.

On the Atlantic side, off the coast of New England, the foggiest months are usually June, July, and August, with a maximum of fog generally occurring during July. In this month, fog is normally encountered about 50 percent of the time. Off the Middle Atlantic Coast, however, fog occurs mostly in the winter and spring months, with a tendency toward minimum frequency in summer and autumn. Along the South Atlantic Coast (from Cape Hatteras to the tip of Florida) and in the Gulf of Mexico, fog rarely creates a problem for boaters. It is virtually nonexistent during the summer, and even in the winter and early spring season (December through March), when it has maximum frequency, the number of days with fog rarely exceeds 20 during this four-month period.

The Great Lakes as a whole tend to have fog in the warmer season. The explanation for this is to be found in the comparison of the lake temperatures with the air temperatures over the surrounding land. From March or April to the beginning of September, the lakes tend to be colder than the air. Hence, whenever the dew-point temperature is sufficiently high, conditions favor the formation of advection fog over the water.

The greatest fogginess occurs when and where the lakes are coldest in relation to the air blowing off the surrounding land. On Lake Superior, north-central Lake Michigan, and northwestern Lake Huron, the time of maximum frequency is late May and June; elsewhere it is late April and May. Since the lake temperatures become colder from south to north and from the shores outward, the occurrence of fog increases northward and toward the lakes’ centers.

## WINDS

One of the major weather elements is wind—the horizontal movement of air. Winds have a major impact on people and their activities, not the least of which is boating.

### Circulation Patterns

Wind is explained by a fundamental law of physics. As a gas (in this case, air) is heated, it expands, becoming less dense (lighter), and thus tends to rise. Conversely, cooling air contracts, becoming more dense (heavier) and tends to sink. Air is primarily heated by contact with the earth’s surface; this air rises, and surrounding surface air rushes in to fill the relative void, which is, in turn, replaced by cooler air sinking from aloft. This process of circulation is essentially continuous, resulting in horizontal and vertical air movements over wide areas.

The nearer the equator, the more nearly vertical the angle of the sun’s rays are all year, resulting in greater heating at the surface. Thus, the equatorial air rises and flows toward the poles at higher altitudes. Rising air is then replaced by a stream of colder air from the poles toward the tropical regions at lower altitudes. This simple pattern is modified by the earth’s rotation (known, for the person who described it, as the Coriolis effect) and by the distribution of landmasses.

In the northern hemisphere, the northward flowing air at high altitudes is bent eastward and, by the time it reaches about 30° latitude, has started to build up an area of higher pressure forcing some of the flow downward and back toward the equator. This portion becomes a steady flow near the surface back toward the equator that is bent westward by the earth’s rotation—the reliable “northeast trade winds” of the northern subtropical zone. The portion that continues northward toward the pole eventually descends as the “prevailing westerlies” of the higher midlatitudes. Between these regions there are the “horse latitudes,” near 30°, where winds are weaker and less constant. Near the equator, where the warmed air rises and turns north or south, the region of weaker winds is called the “doldrums”; see Figure 24-06.

Figure 24-06 These idealized global air circulation patterns are based to a large extent on the heated air that rises along the equator and descends as cold air at the poles and at latitudes approximately 30° from the equator, the “horse latitudes.”

#### Local Wind Patterns

Temperature differences—heating and cooling air—cause localized breezes as well as global winds. Land areas usually heat up more quickly than water areas during hours of sunlight; air rising over the land is replaced by air coming in from seaward—these are the refreshing “sea breezes”; see Figure 24-07A.

Figure 24-07 In the daytime, A, when the land is warmer, air rises over the land and is replaced by cooler air coming in from seaward. This activity creates a “sea breeze.” At night, B, the opposite occurs when the temperature of the land is lower than that of the sea. There is then a “land breeze.”

Subsequently, at night, the land loses its heat more quickly, the water’s surface becomes the relatively warmer areas, and “land breezes” flow towards the sea. In both cases, these breezes are felt quite close to the surface; there is a counter-flow of air at higher elevations to complete the local circulation pattern; see Figure 24-07B.

Both of these breezes, interacting with general wind patterns, can generate showers and thunderstorms.

### Winds Afloat

Wind direction and strength are a matter of constant interest, and sometimes concern, to every boater. The measurement of these values, and their use in forecasting immediate and future weather conditions will be covered later in this chapter.

## HIGHS & LOWS

Familiarity with atmospheric pressure is essential in understanding weather because the pressure distribution in the atmosphere controls the winds and, to a considerable extent, the occurrence of clouds and precipitation. For a boater watching the weather, it is important to comprehend how the winds and other elements relate to the pressure distribution on a weather map.

The global circulation of the atmosphere resulting from unequal heating results in the building up of areas where the weight of air (atmospheric pressure) is greater than or less than that surrounding it. These are the highs and lows that are seen on weather maps, usually designated by large letters “H” and “L.”

#### General Characteristics

Highs, also called “anticyclones,” generally bring dry weather. Lows, also called “cyclones” (this term is used to generically describe weather events having a strong cyclonic circulation and is also used specifically to describe hurricanes in the Indian Ocean), generally bring unsettled weather and precipitation. Highs and lows are rather large areas of weather measured in many hundreds of miles or kilometers across. In the northern hemisphere, circulation around an area of high pressure is clockwise; around lows, it is counter-clockwise. (Circulation is the opposite in the southern hemisphere.) Winds are generally weaker in highs than in low-pressure systems.

### The Formation of Highs

In the earth’s general circulation system, areas of high pressure are formed by the descent of cold, dense air toward the surface in polar regions and in the horse latitudes (near 30° latitude); refer to Figure 24-06. As air flows outward toward areas of lower pressure, the rotation of the earth changes its direction so that a clockwise circulation is established. Highs form sequentially in the north polar region and move southward; as they reach the latitudes of the prevailing westerlies, they are carried first southeastward, than eastward, and often finally northeastward.

The existence of continents and oceans distorts the theoretical picture of the formation of highs and lows; the actual process is quite complex. High-pressure “breeding zones” form in relatively specific areas rather than in broad zones; these areas change between summer and winter.

### The Formation of Lows

The formation of low-pressure cells (see this page) usually is quite different from that of highs, although large-scale lows, for example, annually develop over deserts and other relatively warm spots. However, the following describes what is usually considered when a low is discussed. The boundary between two masses of air of different temperatures is termed a front. This is a major weather phenomenon that will be considered in detail in the following section. On such a boundary, a horizontal wavelike situation develops; refer to Figure 24-13. This grows and becomes more and more distinct and may even “break” as an ocean wave does on a beach.

## AIR MASSES & FRONTS

A general knowledge of air masses and fronts will make weather forecasts more understandable and more useful.

### Air Masses

An air mass is any large body of air (covering as much as several hundred thousand square miles (a million or more square kilometers) in which the conditions of temperature and moisture are essentially homogeneous.

#### Basic Characteristics

Air masses derive their basic characteristics from the surface beneath them. The homogeneous properties are acquired as the mass remains over the source area for an extended period of time until the uniformity is achieved. This source area can be continental or maritime and polar or tropical. Once developed, the mass tends to retain those characteristics even while moving over different surfaces; see Table 24-1. Those characteristics and their comparison with those of the surface over which the air mass is moving—warmer or colder—define the air mass. Figure 24-08 shows the principal air masses that affect North America and their general normal movement.

Table 24-1 An air mass is a body of air in which temperature and moisture conditions are essentially the same in all directions horizontally. It may be described as stable or unstable, as shown in the table above.

Figure 24-08 Shown here are the sources and direction of movement of the air masses that influence weather in North America. The properties of an air mass, and its conflicts with adjacent air masses, are the causes of weather changes. Note that some are seasonal only, such as those above the south-central U.S. (near Texas) called “superior,” meaning it is an exceptionally dry air mass.

Maritime and continental air masses differ significantly in their characteristics of temperature and humidity and generate different kinds of weather. Oceans experience less extreme variations of heat and cold than do continents, and maritime air masses change less with seasons. As a result, a maritime air mass moving over land tends to moderate any conditions of excess heat or cold.

Most active weather is generated around lows or at the boundaries between air masses. However, showers or thunderstorms frequently occur within moist air masses, especially warm moist air masses.

### Weather Fronts

A general knowledge of air masses is important as it leads directly to our consideration of weather fronts. A front is the boundary between two different air masses; the bodies of air do not tend to mix, but rather each moves with respect to the other. The passage of a front results in a change of weather conditions at that location. The bigger the difference in characteristics between two adjacent air masses, the stronger the front is said to be. And the stronger the front, the greater is the potential for active, sometimes violent, weather.

#### Cold Fronts

With a cold front, the oncoming cold air mass, being denser, pushes under the warm air mass and forces it upward; see Figure 24-09. In the northern hemisphere, cold fronts generally lie along a NE-SW line and move eastward or southeastward. The rate of movement is roughly 400-500 statute miles (650-800 km) per day. The stronger the cold front, the faster it tends to move. Since air masses tend to be most diverse in the transition seasons, fronts generally will move the fastest in late winter and spring.

Figure 24-09 In this cross section of a cold front, a cold air mass is shown advancing from the left, pushing aloft the warm air mass it displaces. Thunderstorms usually occur when the temperature differences are great and rapidly rising warm air ahead of the cold front forms towering cumulus clouds.

A strong, rapidly moving cold front will bring weather changes that may be quite intense but relatively brief in duration. These active cold fronts are often characterized by a line of strong thunderstorms. In late summer, when air mass differences are smaller, slower moving cold fronts may be accompanied by scattered clouds along the frontal boundary, but no precipitation.

A squall line is a line of thunderstorms ahead of an approaching cold front. In fact, there may be more than one squall line in very unstable air masses. Squall lines may be very turbulent with strong winds endangering small craft. A strong increase in wind (called a squall) often accompanies a squall line. Boaters need to understand the difference between gusts and squalls. A gust is a rapid fluctuation of wind with a variation of at least 10 knots between peaks and lulls. Gusty conditions may last for several days. A squall, on the other hand, is a sudden increase in which the average wind speed rises at least 15 knots and remains at 20 knots or more for over one minute. Although both are potentially dangerous, the squall, because of the suddenness and intensity of change, is usually worse. A squall line appears as a wall of very dark, threatening clouds. A squall line may produce weather more severe than that of the front itself.

The approach of a cold front is indicated by a shift of the wind toward the south, then to the southwest. Barometric pressure readings fall. As the front approaches, tall cumuloform clouds are usually present with the bottoms (bases) of these dropping closer to the earth’s surface. Rain starts slowly but may increase rapidly.

As the front passes the wind continues to veer (change in a clockwise direction), westward, northwestward, and then sometimes northerly. After passage the sky clears quickly, temperatures drop, pressure builds up quickly, and the wind may continue to veer to the northeast. For a few days at least, the weather will have the characteristics of a cold air mass, although gusty winds may continue, especially if the front was strong.

#### Warm Fronts

A warm front occurs when an advancing warm air mass reaches colder air. The warmer air, being less dense, cannot push under the cold air such as in a cold front. It rides up over it; see Figure 24-10. Warm fronts are generally oriented in directions N-S, NW-SE, or E-W and change their direction more often than cold fronts do. The rate of movement is slower, 150 to 200 miles (240-320 km) per day; thus warm fronts are eventually overtaken by the next following cold front.

Figure 24-10 In this cross section of a warm front, the warm air is shown moving aloft on top of the underlying wedge of cold air, which retreats as the warm air advances. The cloud sequence at the front is first cirrus, then cirrostratus, then altostratus, and finally nimbostratus in the rain area.

Warm-front weather is usually milder than that of a cold front and may extend several hundreds of miles (500-600 km) in advance of the frontal line. Clouds are found at lowering levels as the front approaches, and rainfall is generally more moderate but extended in time. The approach of a warm front is signaled by a falling barometer (but falling more slowly than for an approaching cold front), a buildup of clouds, and the onset of rain or drizzle. The winds are generally from an easterly direction north of the front and gradually veer to the south as the front passes. After the front passes there will be cumulus clouds and temperatures will rise; the barometer will also slowly rise.

#### Stationary Fronts

Occasionally, when a frontal boundary is between two similar air masses, the front will show little or no forward movement; this is a stationary front. Any weather along the front is likely to be weak.

#### Occluded Fronts

An occluded front is a more complex situation where we have warm air, cold air, and colder air. It occurs after a cold front, because of its faster movement, overtakes a warm front and lifts the warm air mass off the ground. Either the warm front or the cold front is pushed upward from the earth’s surface; see Figure 24-11 and Figure 24-12. The appearance on a weather map is that of a curled “tail” extending back toward the low from the junction of the cold and warm fronts. In a satellite photo, this looks like a comma. Both warm-front and cold-front precipitation can occur surrounding an occlusion.

Figure 24-11 This cross section of a warm-type occlusion illustrates how the advancing cool air rides up on the cold air ahead—acting somewhat like a warm front—and the warm air then is pushed aloft.

Figure 24-12 In this cross-section of a cold-type occlusion, the advancing cold air moves under the cool air forcing the cool air aloft—acting like a cold front. Once again, the warm air is moved above the surface.

## STORMS & SEVERE WEATHER

Although a boater is interested in whatever the weather is and what is forecast, real attention is focused on the possibility of storms. While sunny skies and fair winds are eagerly awaited, it is the approach of a storm that causes concern for the safety of the crew, passengers, and for the boat itself.

### Extra-Tropical Cyclones

The principal source of rain, winds, and generally foul weather in the U.S. is the extra-tropical cyclone. Although some other types of storms may be more destructive, the extra-tropical cyclone is the ultimate cause of most active weather. Such a storm (in the northern hemisphere) is defined as a traveling system of winds rotating counterclockwise around a center of low barometric pressure and containing at least a warm front and a cold front. The warm air mass is typically moist tropical air, and the cold air mass is polar continental.

#### Development of an Extra-Tropical Cyclone

The development of an extra-tropical cyclone is shown in Figure 24-13. At A, there is a warm air mass, typically moist tropical air, flowing northeastward bordering a cold air mass, typically polar continental, flowing southwestward. They are separated by a heavy line representing the front, a stationary front, between them. At B, a small wave has formed on the front. Cold air from behind pushes under the warm air; the warm air rushes up over the cold air ahead of it. A cold front is born on the left, a warm front on the right. Where they are connected, the barometric pressure is lowered and the air starts circulating counterclockwise. A low develops, and a high will form behind the cold front.

Figure 24-13 This series of sketches illustrates the development of an extra-tropical cyclone. The thin lines are isobars that pass through points of equal barometric pressure. Arrows indicate wind directions.

Pushed by the earth’s general circulation patterns, the whole system keeps moving in a general easterly direction. When warm, moist air is lifted, as it is when a cold air mass pushes under it or when it rushes up over cold air ahead, it cools by expansion. After its temperature has fallen to the dew point, excess water vapor condenses to form clouds and then precipitation; the stippled area represents this.

At C in Figure 24-13, the storm is steadily developing, with the low-pressure area intensifying more and more. The clouds and rain are increasing, and the winds are becoming stronger. At D, the storm is approaching maturity. The circulation around the low has intensified.

By the time E is reached, the cold front has begun to catch up with the warm front and an occluded front is formed; the storm is now at its height. When the situation at F is reached, the storm has begun to weaken and the weather will soon clear as a high behind the cold front reaches the area. (Exception: Cold air over warm water may actually enhance the development of showers and thunderstorms.)

Extra-tropical cyclones are constantly forming, moving, and dying around the globe. It takes about one day (24 hours) for any one disturbance to reach maturity. However, although most usually dissipate within three or possibly four days, some can last for a week or more. In winter, these storms occur on the average of twice a week in the U.S.; in summer they occur somewhat less frequently and are less intense. Their movement is generally eastward to north of east at a speed in winter of about 700 miles (1,100 km) per day and in summer perhaps 500 miles (800 km). Such storms usually cover a large area; they can affect a given locality for two days or more.

### Thunderstorms

While extra-tropical cyclones are the principal source of wind, rain, and generally foul weather for large areas, there are also local, small-scale but intense thunderstorms, which you must be prepared to handle. These are embedded in extra-tropical cyclones, usually linked to the cold and occluded fronts. If the air comprising the warm sector is sufficiently unstable, however, which is often the case in spring or summer, thunderstorms may also be associated with the warm front or be found within the warm sector itself.

A thunderstorm is a storm of short duration, arising only from a cumulonimbus cloud, attended by thunder and lightning, and marked by abrupt fluctuations of temperature, pressure, and wind. A line squall, now usually referred to in meteorological terms as a squall line, is a lengthy row of thunderstorms that may stretch for 100 miles (160 km) or more.

Incidentally, a shower (as opposed to gentle, steady rain) is a smaller brother to the thunderstorm, though the rainfall and wind in it may be of considerable intensity. A shower is the product of relatively large cumulus (towering cumulus) clouds separated from one another by blue sky. A shower is over quickly and is not accompanied by thunder and lightning. However, it may be strong enough to generate a waterspout.

#### Requirements for Thunderstorm Formation

There are three requirements for the development of a thunderstorm.

• Lifting Mechanism There must be strong upward air currents, such as those caused by a cold front burrowing under warm air or by the heating of air in contact with the surface of the earth on a summer day, to lift surface air.

• Instability The air parcels forming the storm must be buoyant (warmer) relative to the air outside the storm and be able to keep on ascending higher and higher until they pass the freezing level.

• Moisture The air must have a large concentration of water vapor. The most promising thunderstorm air is of tropical maritime origin; whenever it appears in your cruising area, especially when a cold front is approaching, you need to be watchful.

The life cycle of a thunderstorm usually lasts about an hour. However, subsequent thunderstorms will often develop near where the former one dissipated, feeding off the moisture left by the earlier storm, making it seem as if the storm were longer-lived than it actually was. Also, the cooler, denser air brought to the earth’s surface by the downdrafts induced in the previous thunderstorm can act as the lifting mechanism for generating the next one.

As the thunderstorm cycle begins, a cumulus cloud forms and grows vertically. Boaters should watch such growing clouds and developing storms very closely and be prepared to take evasive or protective actions; see Figure 24-14. Vacuuming air from miles around its base, and feeding on moisture that may have been carried aloft by earlier clouds, the cumulus cloud continues growing. It becomes a towering cumulus and, eventually, it develops into a cumulonimbus (thunderstorm) cloud. Rain drops or ice particles form and, as they become too heavy for the updraft to support, fall, inducing down-drafts. Over time, these down-drafts cut off the air inflow, and the growth process ceases. The cloud essentially precipitates itself away, leaving residual middle- and high-level clouds.

Figure 24-14 This sequence of photographs shows the growth of an anvil top. The left photo was taken at noon, the middle at 1220, and the right photo at 1230.

#### Characteristics of a Thunderstorm

In all cases, the prime danger signal for a thunderstorm is a cumulus cloud growing larger. Every thunderstorm cloud has four distinctive features, although you may not always be able to see all four as other clouds may intervene in your line of sight. Figure 24-15 is a drawing of a cumulonimbus cloud showing these four features diagrammatically. Starting at the top, notice the layer of cirrus clouds, shaped like an anvil (consequently called an anvil top), leaning in the direction toward which the upper wind is blowing; this generally tells us the direction in which the storm is moving. The anvil-top development is illustrated in Figure 24-14; these three photographs were taken from the same position over a time interval of only one-half hour!

Figure 24-15 This typical thunderstorm is based on a cumulonimbus cloud that may tower from 25,000 to 50,000 feet high. The anvil top indicates the direction that the wind is blowing.

The next feature is the main body of the cloud—a large cumulus of great height with cauliflower sides. It must be of great height, as it must extend far above the freezing level if the cirrus anvil top is to form. (Cirrus clouds are composed of ice crystals, not water droplets.)

The third feature is the roll cloud. This is formed by violent air currents along the leading edge of the base of the cumulus cloud.

The fourth and final feature is the dark area within the storm and extending from the base of the cloud to the earth; at the center of this is precipitation. This core is generally beneath the strongest part of the thunderstorm. Hail and heavy precipitation are most likely to be found in this core area.

Ahead of a thunderstorm the wind may be steady or variable, but as the roll cloud draws near, the wind may weaken or become unsteady; see Figure 24-15. As the roll cloud passes overhead, violent shifting winds accompanied by strong downdrafts may be expected. The wind velocity may reach 60 knots or more. Heavy precipitation, and sometimes hail, begins to fall just behind the roll cloud. The weather usually clears quickly after the passage of the storm. The precipitation usually has brought cooler air to the surface so, for at least a time, temperatures and humidity are lower.

Individually, thunderstorms can produce tornadoes, waterspouts, or microbursts with winds measuring over 120 knots. They can spawn hailstones as large as grapefruits and can generate lightning bolts of unbelievable power. The thunderstorm is the single most powerful weather element there is. All severe weather either comes from or, like a hurricane, is made up of thunderstorms. Never take these lightly. When you hear thunderstorms in the forecast or see them in your area, heighten your alert.

#### Frequency of Thunderstorms

Thunderstorms occur most frequently, and with the greatest intensity, in the spring and summer over all parts of the U.S. They may strike at any hour, but are most common in the late afternoon and early evening over inland and coastal waters. The surrounding land has been a good “stove” for many hours, heating the air to produce strong upward currents. Over the ocean, well away from shore, thunderstorms more commonly occur between midnight and sunrise. Finally, thunderstorms are most frequent and most violent in subtropical latitudes. Boaters in the southeastern part of the U.S. may see four or more thunderstorms per summer week.

If the cumulonimbus cloud is fully developed and towers to normal thunderstorm altitudes, 35,000 feet (10.7 km) or more in spring and summer, the storm will likely be violent. If the anvil top is low, only 20,000 feet (6.1 km) or so, as is usual in winter and autumn, the storm will likely be less severe. If the cumulonimbus cloud is not fully developed, particularly if it lacks the anvil top, and the roll cloud is missing, only a shower is most likely.

##### LIGHTNING & THUNDER

A buildup of dissimilar positive and negative electrical charges occurs within a vertically developing cumulonimbus cloud, between the cloud and the earth below (the earth normally has a negative charge), or between neighboring clouds. When the buildup of opposite charges becomes great enough, a lightning flash occurs. These can occur within a cloud, from one cloud to another, or between the cloud and ground. Actually what we think of as a flash is really a series of strikes back and forth over a period of roughly two-tenths of a second. A flash to the surface usually starts with a faint “leader” from the cloud followed instantly by a massive strike upward from the surface. About two-thirds of all lightning flashes are within clouds and never reach the surface. A lightning flash is almost unbelievably powerful—up to 30,000,000 volts at 100,000 amperes; it happens so quickly that it is essentially explosive in nature.

The sudden, vast amount of heat energy released by a lightning flash causes the sound waves termed thunder. This release of energy comes from the collapse of the atmosphere around the lightning strike.

Lightning protection for boats is discussed on this page.

#### Anticipating Thunderstorms

The possibility of a thunderstorm may be first noticed from static crashes on an AM radio receiver. You can plot the approach, once the cumulonimbus cloud is visible, with a series of bearings; you can also estimate its distance from you. The thunder and lightning occur simultaneously at the point of lightning discharge, but we see the lightning discharge much sooner than we hear the thunder. Time this interval in seconds. Multiply the number of seconds by 0.2 (or divide by 5); the result will be approximate distance off in statute miles (multiply by 0.34, or divide by 3, to get distance off in kilometers). Take care, however, that you are properly associating a particular flash with its thunder; this may be difficult if there is nearly continuous lightning.

A good safety guide is the “30/30” rule. The first “30” represents 30 seconds or about 6 miles. If the time between lightning and thunder is less than 30 seconds, you or your vessel can be struck. The second “30” is to remind the boater to wait 30 minutes after the last lightning flash to move from shelter. More than half of the lightning deaths each year occur after a thunderstorm has passed. Also remember, lightning may impact an area out to 60 feet or more from where it has hit the surface.

Take precautions well before lightning begins. Don’t wait. Lower radio antennas, outriggers, and sails, and drop anchors if necessary. Go into the cabin if possible, or at least keep a low profile below the freeboard. Avoid contact with the hull or with metal fittings, especially those associated with the lightning conduction system. Don’t touch radio equipment or wiring. Depending on your situation, you might want to disconnect power cables from expensive equipment, separating these wires as far apart as possible. And keep your life jacket on in case you are rendered unconscious.

### Tornadoes

Tornadoes are whirlpools of small horizontal extent that extend downward from a thunderstorm and have a funnel-like appearance; see Figure 24-16. (The only exception: weak tornadoes can be generated when spiraling surface winds are caught in the updraft of a rapidly developing towering cumulus cloud.) The average diameter of the visible funnel cloud is about 250 yards (230 m), but the destructive effects of this system of whirling winds may extend outward from the tornado center as much as one-half mile (0.8 km) on each side. The wind speed near the core can only be estimated, but it is at least as high as 300 knots. Any thunderstorm can produce a tornado. However, the bigger the cumulonimbus cloud, the more likely it is that a tornado will form. Although tornadoes can occur at any time and in any location that a thunderstorm is found, they usually are seen, in boating areas, adjacent to the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts of North America and in all inland boating areas east of the Rocky Mountains.

Figure 24-16 A tornado funnel is a cloud of water droplets mixed with dust and debris that are drawn up because of the greatly reduced atmospheric pressure within the funnel. This pressure drop causes the wind to whirl inward and upward.

Thunderstorms producing tornadoes move with or to the right of the upper-level winds pushing the storm. This wind is usually from the southwest. The air mass in which the storm develops typically consists of two layers: a very moist one (whose source was the Gulf of Mexico) near the ground, and a relatively dry layer above. The temperature decreases with altitude rather rapidly in each layer. When this combination of air layers is lifted along a squall line or cold front, excessive instability develops, and violent updrafts are created.

### Waterspouts

Tornadoes do occur over water. When this occurs, they are called waterspouts. Although there are other less intense features over the water that are also called waterspouts (similar to dust devils over the desert), boaters should treat any such feature with respect and allow a lot of distance between it and their vessel. They are a threat to small craft. The conditions favoring the formation of waterspouts at sea are similar to those conducive to the formation of tornadoes over land. However, they are much more frequent in the tropics than in middle latitudes.

A waterspout, like a tornado, forms under a towering cumulus or cumulonimbus cloud. A funnel-shaped protuberance (funnel cloud) first appears at the base of the parent cloud and grows downward toward the sea. Beneath it the water becomes agitated, and a cloud of spray forms. The funnel cloud descends until it merges with the spray; it then assumes the shape of a tube that stretches from the sea surface to the base of the cloud; see Figure 24-17.

Figure 24-17 A waterspout over St. Louis Bay, off Henderson Point, Mississippi. Note the cloud of spray just above the sea surface. This is the marine equivalent of a tornado, although usually smaller.

The diameter of a waterspout may vary from 20 to 200 feet (6–60 m) or more. Its length from the sea to the base of the cloud is usually between 1,000 and 2,000 feet (300–600 m). It may last from ten minutes to half an hour. Its upper part often travels at a different speed and in a different direction from its base, so that it becomes bent and stretched-out. Finally, the tube breaks at a point about one-third of the way up to the cloud base, and the “spout” at the sea surface quickly subsides.

The considerably reduced air pressure at the center of a waterspout is clearly indicated by visible variations of the water level. A mound of water, a foot (0.3 m) or so high, sometimes appears at the core, because the atmospheric pressure inside the funnel is perhaps 30 to 40 millibars less than that on the surface of the water surrounding the spout. This difference causes the rise of water at the center.

Remember, tornadoes and waterspouts are winds. You cannot see the wind. What you see in each is cloud material that has been sucked down by the whirling action or surface material (water, dirt, or other debris) picked up by the strong winds. Such material may be carried for long distances. For example, considerable quantities of salt spray, picked up by the strong winds at the base of the spout, are sometimes carried far aloft. This has been verified by observations of a fall of salty rain following the passage of a waterspout.

Boaters need to understand that some waterspouts are tornadoes that formed over land and then moved out over water. Special marine warnings are issued to alert boaters of such an occurrence. These are broadcast over VHF NOAA Weather Radio and by the U.S. Coast Guard.

##### MICROBURST: A DISASTROUS FORCE

Tornadoes are not the only strong winds that can come from a thunderstorm. There is a potential danger lurking in the form of a microburst. This is a concentrated column of sinking air that spreads out in all directions when it reaches the surface. These straight-line winds may reach 30 to 40 knots but in some instances have been estimated at over 120 knots. Microbursts often occur in a series of varying powers and dimensions. Although they last only a few minutes, they are known to have capsized and destroyed boats. The greatest threat is to sailboats underway with normal sails set—the almost instantaneous onset of winds from an unpredicted direction (squall) is a major threat. Unlike a dry squall, which can usually be seen approaching across the water, a microburst’s winds will strike your boat before anyone takes notice. They frequently appear in groups; don’t relax after one passes!

Although microbursts are usually associated with seasonal thunderstorms, they can also occur during rainstorms that are not accompanied by thunder and lightning, such as along squall lines. The strongest winds are in or near the center of the storm where heavy rain, and frequently hail, is falling. Often the gust front precedes the microburst; this is a frontal zone of advancing cold air, characterized by a sudden increase in wind speed and followed by gusty winds. The combination of these two strong wind systems can easily be fatal.

The best protection against microbursts is avoidance. Prepare for every boating trip by obtaining the latest marine weather forecasts. Listen to the NOAA Weather Radio channels or the U.S. Coast Guard. Continuous broadcasts of the latest marine weather information are provided on various frequencies; see this page. And keep aware of what is happening around you. Remember that thunderstorms are dangerous weather systems and can have strong, gusty winds that vary in direction and speed. Be sure your boat has adequate stability to help you cope with strong winds in the event of their unexpected occurrence.

Another phenomenon associated with thunderstorms is the macroburst. This is, essentially, a microburst that covers a wider area—more than 2.5 miles in diameter—with generally similar conditions.

### Hurricanes: The Tropical Cyclones

Hurricane is the popular term for a tropical cyclone in North America. Unlike an extra-tropical cyclone, it is not related to warm and cold fronts. A hurricane is defined as a storm of tropical origin with a counterclockwise circulation reaching a strength of 64 knots (74 mph) or more at the center.

In its earlier stages, with winds less than 33 knots (38 mph) but with a closed circulatory pattern, the term is a tropical depression. When the winds increase beyond 33 knots, it is a tropical storm until it reaches hurricane strength. In the Western Pacific Ocean, the term used for tropical cyclones is typhoon, and because of the greater expanse of ocean there, these storms often become even larger and more intense than hurricanes. In the Indian Ocean, they are called cyclones.

#### Frequency of Tropical Cyclones

The frequency of hurricanes and typhoons varies around the world. In the Far East, typhoons may occur in any month, although they are most common in late summer and early autumn. In North American waters, the period from early December through May is usually, but not always, hurricane free. August, September, and October are the months of greatest frequency; in these months hurricanes typically, but again not always, form over the tropical Atlantic, mostly between latitudes 8° N and 20° N. The infrequent hurricanes of June and November almost always originate in the southwestern part of the Caribbean Sea. Interestingly, hurricanes are extremely rare in the South Atlantic.

Hurricanes also occur in the Eastern Pacific off the coast of Mexico, and, infrequently, the direct effect of these storms reaches well into the southwestern U.S. More frequently, the swells generated by these storms can cause much damage to coastal regions of southern California. Some of these storms may affect the Hawaiian Islands.

#### Development of a Hurricane

The birthplace of a hurricane typically lies within a diffuse and fairly large area of relatively low pressure situated somewhere in the 8°N-20°N latitude belt. In the Atlantic, they often develop from weak disturbances moving off the Sahara Desert. The winds around the low-pressure area are not particularly strong, and, although cumulonimbus clouds and showers are more numerous than is usual in these latitudes, there is no clearly organized “weather system.” This poorly defined condition may persist for several days before hurricane development commences. The development of highly sophisticated weather satellites has greatly improved the ability of forecasters to watch vast ocean areas where these storms originate for any signs of conditions favorable for hurricane development.

When development starts, however, it takes place relatively quickly. Within an interval of 12 hours or less the barometric pressure drops 15 millibars or more over a small, almost circular area. (See this page for explanation of units of pressure.) Winds increase and form a ring around the area; the width of this ring is at first only 20 to 40 miles (37 to 74 km). Clouds and thunderstorms become well organized and show a spiral structure. At this stage the growing tropical cyclone acquires an eye. This is the inner area enclosed by the ring of stronger winds, and within the eye we find the lowest barometric reading. As the tropical cyclone intensifies and as the central pressure continues to fall, the features become more defined and the winds speeds increase. By the time the cyclone reaches maturity, the ring of strongest winds surrounding the eye will have reached a diameter of somewhere between 50 (small hurricane) and 300 miles.

Hurricane eyes average about 15 miles (28 km) in diameter but may be as large as 25 miles (46 km). The wind velocities in the eye of a hurricane are seldom greater than 15 knots and often are less. Cloud conditions vary over a wide range. At times there are only scattered clouds, but usually there is more than 50 percent cloud cover. Through the openings, the sky is visible overhead, and, at a distance, the dense towering clouds of the hurricane ring can extend to great heights. This feature is the eye wall. Seas within the eye are heavy and confused; the “calm” is only with respect to winds.

#### Hurricane Tracks

Hurricanes may seem to move in any direction they choose. However, the usual track of an Atlantic hurricane is a parabola around the semipermanent Azores-Bermuda high-pressure area. Thus, after forming, a hurricane will move westward on the southern side of the Azores-Bermuda High, at the same time tending to work away from the equator. When the hurricane reaches the western side of this high, it begins to follow a more northerly track, and its direction of advance changes progressively toward the right. The position where the westward movement changes to an eastward movement is known as the point of curvature.

Occasionally when a hurricane is in a position near the southeast Atlantic coast, the Azores-Bermuda High happens to have an abnormal northward extension. In this situation the hurricane may fail to execute a complete recurvature in the vicinity of Cape Hatteras. It will skirt the western side of the high and come ashore along the southeast U.S. Coast, as occurred with Hurricane Katrina, a major storm of 2005; see Figure 24-18.

Figure 24-18 After crossing Florida from east to west, Hurricane Katrina strengthened as it moved over the Gulf of Mexico and came ashore on the Mississippi-Louisiana coast with winds of 145 mph, gusting to 160 mph. More than 1,300 persons died; hundreds of ships and thousands of boats were destroyed or damaged.

The rate of movement of tropical cyclones while they are still in low latitudes and heading westward is about 15 knots, which is considerably slower than the usual rate of travel of extra-tropical cyclones. After recurving, they begin to move faster and usually attain a forward speed of at least 25 knots. They may reach 50 to 60 knots in the latter stages before dissipating.

Other storms, particularly early in the season, form in the Caribbean Sea and move westward and north into the Gulf of Mexico. And still other hurricanes, like Katrina in 2005, form later in the season.

Hurricanes gradually decrease in intensity after they reach middle and high latitudes and move over colder water. They quickly lose strength after moving on shore. All tropical cyclones lose their identity eventually, becoming large extra-tropical cyclones.

#### Effects of El Niño and La Niña

The phenomenon called El Niño is a disruption of the ocean-atmosphere system in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Basically, every few years the water across a huge area in the eastern Pacific warms. This, of course, warms the air above it. The result is that the earth’s entire circulation pattern changes. Of most significance is that this changes the position of the jet stream winds (high-speed winds near the tropopause, generally westerly). Since storm systems tend to follow the jet stream, for about a year or so, the usual time period of an El Niño, unusual weather patterns result. Rainfall may be increased in the southern part of the U.S. and Peru, while drought conditions develop in Australia and neighboring countries. The existence of El Niño conditions mitigates both the frequency and intensity of Atlantic hurricanes.

La Niña is the opposite condition of below-average sea surface temperatures across the equatorial eastern Pacific. Possible results include an active Atlantic hurricane season, above-average precipitation in northwestern North America, and below-average precipitation in the southern U.S.

## WEATHER FORECASTS

Some years ago, to be considered a fully qualified skipper, you had to be able to take a series of complex daily weather maps and forecast your own weather; see Figure 24-19. Now this is no longer necessary, although the ability to read and understand a simplified weather map will always be useful. The ready availability of weather forecasts by radio, TV, satellites, marine facsimile, and the Internet does much of the work for you—but you still have the responsibility to get, and heed, the information.

Figure 24-19 The symbols shown above are those found on weather maps used professionally by the National Weather Service. The sample station model, Figure 24-20, shows how these are used. The average boater need know only a few of them.

Get your forecasts by any and every means possible, but keep an eye on present conditions, especially on changes in them. A forecast of good, safe conditions for your general area does not preclude temporary local differences that could be hazardous. Keep alert for special warnings broadcast by the Coast Guard on VHF Channel 22A (or 22) following a preliminary announcement on Channel 16.

### Weather Maps

As with your navigation charts, information on weather maps is presented by use of symbols. Some of the more frequently encountered symbols will be described below; the many others now used only by professionals are omitted; refer to Figure 24-19.

#### Station Models

A complete station model for a reporting location will tell you much more than you need to know; see Figure 24-20. It includes information on wind direction and speed; temperature; visibility; cloud type, amount, and height; current pressure and past change plus current tendency; precipitation in past three hours; dew point temperatures; and current weather. Simplified models omit much of this and often show only current weather, temperature, and wind direction and speed.

Figure 24-20 The sample station model shown here illustrates how the many different symbols depicted in Figure 24-19 are combined to give a complete indication of the existing conditions at a specific location.

Current weather is indicated by the appearance of the circle in the center of the station model—open for clear, partially or totally solid for degrees of cloudiness. Current weather—rain, snow, drizzle, etc.—is shown by a symbol immediately to the left of the station circle. Wind direction is indicated by a weather vane line and wind speed by the number, size, and shape of the feathers on the end of the weather vane. Temperature will normally be given in degrees Fahrenheit (degrees Celsius in Canada and other areas using the metric system).

#### Air Masses & Fronts

Air masses may or may not be shown in detail. If their characteristics are shown, large block letters will be used: P for polar and T for tropical. Either of these may be further described as maritime (m) or continental (c). Thus we have cP, mP, and mT—the most common of air masses—as well as cT. Since k indicates colder than the land mass over which it is moving and w indicates warmer than the land mass over which it is moving, more precise labels would include cPk and mPw, for example.

Usually, weather maps show simply highs and lows with a large block letter, H or L; occasionally the word “high” or “low” will be spelled out, or a circle drawn around the letter.

Fronts are shown as a heavy line. Cold fronts have a series of solid triangles on the line that point in the direction of movement; see Figure 24-21. Warm fronts have solid half circles on the line; again the side that they are on indicating the direction of movement of the front. An occluded front has alternating triangles and half circles on the same side of the line. A stationary front has the same alternating symbols but with the triangles on one side of the line and the half circles on the other, indicating no movement.

Figure 24-21 Fronts are shown on weather maps by solid lines, usually heavier than other lines, with triangles or half circles used singly or in combination to indicate the type of front. These symbols face the direction in which the pressure system and its front are moving.

In some simplified sketches, a cold front is shown by a solid heavy line, whereas a warm front is two parallel fine lines; an occluded front is thus a broken line with alternating solid and open segments. On less detailed maps, a front may be shown as merely a heavy line labeled “Cold” or “Warm,” or “Stationary” front. On weather maps in color, a warm front is normally shown in red, and a cold front in blue.

#### Isobars

A line connecting points of equal barometric pressure is termed an isobar. (See this page for explanation of units of pressure.) Such lines are usually drawn on weather maps at intervals of four millibars of pressure—996, 1,000, 1,004, etc.—and are labeled along the line or at each end (96, 00, 04, etc.). On some weather maps, isobars will be labeled for pressure in terms of inches of mercury: 29.97, 30.00, 30.03, etc.

#### Precipitation

Any precipitation—rain, snow, or hail—is shown by one of a series of symbols; refer to Figure 24-19. On less detailed maps, areas of precipitation are often shown by shading or cross-hatching, with a descriptive word nearby or different forms of shading used to distinguish rain, snow, and other forms of precipitation.

### Using Weather Maps

Unless your boat has a weather facsimile (fax) machine or access to the Internet, it is unlikely that you would be able to receive a weather map while out cruising. But if you are so equipped, or can get them on shore, you might like to try your hand at making predictions from one or more weather maps.

Predictions from a single map are, of course, less accurate and reliable than those based on a series of weather maps over regular intervals of time. A forecast from a single map can only be made for 6 to 12 hours ahead—there are too many factors that can upset an orderly flow of events. (Make sure that you are using a map of actual conditions, as of a specified recent time; many weather maps now printed in newspapers are for predicted conditions for the day of publication.) Assume that a front is advancing at roughly 20 miles an hour in the normal direction of movement. Sketch in the position of the front 12 hours after the date and time of the map—assuming that your map of actual conditions is recent enough that you still have time in which to make a usable 12-hour forecast. Then with the advanced front, and knowledge of the conditions accompanying this front, you can make your own forecast.

If you have a series of maps of existing conditions at daily or half-daily intervals, you can make a much better forecast. Predict your frontal movement based on trends as well as actual events. If weather trends tend to repeat themselves in your areas, file sets of weather maps for typical frontal passages as additional guidance. Keep a record of your forecasts, and compare them later with the conditions that actually occurred. Do this over a period of time and the accuracy of your predictions is sure to improve. You can also compare your forecasts with those received by radio or TV from professionals—but don’t peek: make your forecasts first, then compare.

#### Newspaper Weather Maps

The weather maps printed in daily newspapers vary widely in how much information is presented and how details are shown; invariably these maps are less detailed than are official NWS weather maps. Basic information will be shown sufficiently to get a very generalized picture of nationwide weather, but little more than that. As noted above, maps are usually for predicted conditions rather than a report of actual events.

#### Television Weather Maps

Weather maps shown as part of local or network news programs also vary widely in level of detail. They do have advantages over newspaper maps in that they frequently show current conditions, and color is used for a more vivid presentation. Most TV weather reporters use animation to show predicted movement of fronts and weather patterns. Often satellite photographs, either still photos or time-lapse loops, are shown to explain conditions or trends. Current and recent weather radar scans are also interesting and helpful in visualizing rain patterns out to about 125 miles (230 km).

Many local cable TV systems carry The Weather Channel—a continuous live broadcast of current weather conditions and forecasts. Information is quite comprehensive and several specialized services are included. Weather maps in a number of formats are shown, as well as satellite pictures and radar plots from areas of significant weather activity. Periodically, the national broadcast is interrupted for local reports and predictions.

Companion subscription services, transmitted via satellite to boats and ships, include live weather reports (with radar data updated at five-minute intervals), coastal and offshore forecasts, storm tracking and weather advisories, high-resolution wind and wave graphics, and other valuable information. The data are displayed on the vessel’s multifunction monitor screen. With the appropriate service subscription, the receiver used to capture the satellite broadcast can also provide access to the service’s entertainment programs.

### Receiving Weather Forecasts

Professional meteorologists take great care in the preparation of their forecasts. Your responsibility is to read or listen carefully—don’t see or hear something that isn’t there, or something that you were hoping for. Most times on a boat you will get your forecast by listening to a radio transmission. If it is a scheduled broadcast, get a pencil and paper ready and take notes; if you have to use an abbreviated format to keep up with the flow of information, expand your fragments into complete form as soon as possible while the data are still fresh in your mind. Using a small tape recorder can help. If it is a continuous broadcast, take notes anyway, but listen a second time to expand your initial notes. Listen as many times as necessary to get the details fully and accurately. Special warnings on NWS stations are preceded by a ten-second high-pitched tone. If you hear this, grab paper and a pencil and stand by to record the information. Newer VHF radios have a weather alert feature. If this feature is activated and a warning is broadcast, the radio will automatically tune in the appropriate channel.

If you are watching a TV weather report and forecast, it is just as important to take notes, dividing your attention between the picture on the screen and your notepad.

In most instances, you will be able to get a forecast for your local waters. If you can’t, try to get a forecast for the region upwind (usually westward) of you, and apply your knowledge of weather movement to make a forecast for your own area.

Keep your notes on weather forecasts received, and compare them with actual conditions later. You may be able to detect a pattern of error in the forecasts, such as weather frequently arriving 12 hours or so later than is forecast—apparently some forecasters would rather have you prepared a bit early for the arrival of a storm than to be caught short.

#### Weather Forecast Terms

The National Weather Service has an ascending series of alerting messages—advisories, watches, and warnings—for boaters, keyed to increasingly hazardous weather and sea conditions.

While the National Weather Service retired its Coastal Warning Display (Storm Flag) Program some time ago, the Coast Guard continues to display coastal warning signals at selected Coast Guard boat stations. The signals will inform and warn of conditions including small craft advisories, gale warnings, storm warnings, and hurricane warnings; see Figure 24-22. Signals may also be displayed at yacht clubs and marinas. In some areas, the Small Craft Advisory pennant is flown on law-enforcement patrol craft when that condition is established.

Figure 24-22 Although the National Weather Service has discontinued the use of the official systems of flags and lights shown here, the Coast Guard operates a Coastal Warning Display (Storm Flag) program at selected Coast Guard boat stations.

The Weather Service emphasizes that visual storm warnings are only supplementary to the written advisories and warnings given prompt and wide distribution by radio, television, and other media. Important details of the forecasts and warnings with regard to the time, intensity, duration, and direction of storms cannot be given satisfactorily through visual signals alone.

#### Use of Small-Craft Advisories

The term small craft advisory needs some explanation. Although there is now no Weather Service definition of “small craft,” you can infer that this refers to small boats, yachts, tugs, barges with little freeboard, or any other low-powered craft. However, much depends on the skill of the mariner. It is the responsibility of all skippers to decide if their seamanship skills and the seaworthiness of their craft are capable of coping with expected wind and sea conditions. Each person has to make the decision to go or stay.

A small-craft advisory does not distinguish between the expectation of a general all-day blow of 25 knots or so, or, for example, a forecast of isolated, late-afternoon thunderstorms in which winds dangerous to small craft will be localized and of short duration. It is up to you to deduce from your own observations, supplemented by any information you can obtain, which type of situation the advisory applies to and to plan your day accordingly.

There is also a lower-level advisory, small craft should exercise caution, for situations posing lesser hazards.

#### Hurricane Watches & Warnings

Official information is issued by hurricane centers describing all tropical cyclone advisories, watches, and warnings in effect. These bulletins include tropical cyclone locations, intensity, movement, and special precautions that should be taken. advisories describe tropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones prior to the issuance of watches and warnings. When a hurricane threatens, an NWS watch or warning may result. A hurricane watch is an announcement for specific areas that a hurricane or incipient hurricane condition poses a threat to coastal areas—generally within 36 hours. A hurricane warning informs the public that sustained winds of 64 knots (74 mph) or higher associated with a hurricane are expected in a specific coastal area within 24 hours. This warning can remain in effect when dangerously high water or a combination of dangerously high water and exceptionally high waves continues, even though winds may be less than hurricane force.

### Marine Weather Charts

The National Weather Service formerly published a series of 15 marine weather services charts covering the coastal waters of all 50 United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam and the northern Mariana Islands, and the Great Lakes. These charts, of which Figure 24-23 is an example, contain detailed information regarding the times of weather broadcasts from commercial stations, the locations of NWS continuous FM broadcasts and their frequencies, and much other information useful to boaters. As of 2021, only the Alaskan Waters chart is available for download at www.weather.gov/marine/pub, but this website provides a host of links to other weather resources, U.S. and international.

Figure 24-23 Marine Weather Service charts show the location, call signs, and frequencies of the VHF continuous weather broadcast stations in the charted area. Other information of general interest is also shown. As of 2021 the Alaskan Waters chart could be downloaded at www.weather.gov/marine/pub, but other regional charts were no longer being updated due to budget constraints.

Boaters will find much interesting weather information on the various Pilot Charts of the North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans issued by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA). The Pilot Charts show average monthly wind and weather conditions over the oceans and in addition contain a vast amount of supplemental data on subjects closely allied to weather. They are a valuable source of information for skippers of all sizes of vessels on ocean passages and can be accessed from www.weather.gov/marine/pub. See this page.

Each volume of the NOAA Coast Pilot also contains information on climate conditions and weather broadcasts within its coverage area.

### Weather Maps at Sea

Up-to-date weather maps are available when offshore with the use of facsimile radio (RADIOFAX) transmissions. The transmitted information can be automatically received and processed by a special-purpose FAX receiver for display on the vessel’s multifunction chartplotter; see Figure 24-24. The vessel’s SSB receiver can also be used to receive WEFAX signals for decoding and viewing on a general purpose computer equipped with the necessary software. Available charts include surface analysis, prognosis (forecasts for various periods), upper-air winds, wave analysis, seawater temperature, satellite photographs, and others.

Figure 24-24 Up-to-date weather maps can be received at sea via a weather fax receiver.

Current and forecast weather information in text and GRIB file format can be downloaded from a LEO satellite via the Skymate system. Forecast and nowcast weather, including images from the weather radar network, can be received directly from geostationary satellites using services such as Sirius Weather, when within their coverage footprint.

### Weather Information from the Internet

The Internet has become and will continue to be a most important source for weather information of all types. The NWS implementation of graphic rather than word forecasts will continue to revolutionize the detail available from marine products. The place to start is the homepage of the National Weather Service at www.weather.gov. From here you can get almost any weather information you need—current conditions; local and marine forecasts, including offshore areas; weather maps; radar scans; satellite images; past weather and climate data; Marine Weather Service Charts, and many other items.

Weather Underground (www.wunderground.com) and the Weather Channel (www.weather.com.) provide a wide range of weather products of use to the mariner.

## USING LOCAL WEATHER SIGNS

While weather forecasts are helpful, and you should always take care to get them, they are not completely dependable and they are normally made for a relatively large area. To supplement the official forecast, look around your boat frequently. Notice both the current weather and changes over the last hour or so. And finally, you should know how to interpret the weather signs that you see in clouds, winds, and pressure and temperature changes. If you are not in home waters, local advice may assist you with weather just as it does with navigation.

### Cloud Observations

First, identify the cloud form (or forms) observed in the sky, and note whether they are increasing or decreasing in amount and whether they are lowering or lifting. In general, thickening and lowering of a cloud layer, be it a layer of cirrostratus, altocumulus, or altostratus, are signs of approaching wet weather. And when a layer of clouds shows signs of evaporation, that is, when holes or openings begin to appear in a layer of altostratus, or the elements of an altocumulus layer are frayed and indistinct at the edges, we have an indication of improving weather or, at least, delay of any development of foul weather.

Finally, note the sequence of cloud forms during the past few hours. Cirrus clouds are frequently the advance agents of an approaching extra-tropical cyclone, especially if they are followed by a layer of cirrostratus. In this case, the problem is to forecast the track the low-pressure center will take to one side or the other of your location, the nearness of approach of the center, and the intensity of the low.

As the clouds thicken steadily from cirrus to cirrostratus and then to altostratus, you should expect further development to nimbostratus with its rain or snow. There are usually contrary indications if such is not to be the case or if the precipitation will arrive late, amount to little, end soon, or will come in two brief periods separated by several hours of mild, more or less sunny weather.

If the northern horizon remains clear until a layer of altostratus clouds overspreads most of the sky, the low-pressure center will probably be passing to the south without bringing precipitation. If the northern horizon is slow in clouding up but becomes covered by the time the cloud sheet is principally altostratus, there will probably be some precipitation but not much. If the cloud sheet, after increasing to altostratus, breaks up into altocumulus and the sky above is seen to have lost most of its covering of cirrostratus, the low-pressure area is either weakening or passing on to the north.

You can often detect the approach of a line of thunderstorms an hour or more in advance by observing the thin white arch of the cirrus border to the anvil top of the approaching cumulonimbus cloud. The atmosphere ahead of a squall line is often so hazy that only this whitish arch will reveal the presence of a moderately distant cumulonimbus, as the shadowed air under the dense anvil will be invisible behind the sunlit hazy blue air near the observer. Thus, this part of the sky will appear to be clear and will resemble the blue sky above the cirrus arch.

##### WEATHER PROVERBS

With all of modern weather forecasting’s scientific instruments, high-speed computers, and highly trained professionals, don’t overlook the guidance inherent in traditional weather proverbs. Their origins have been lost in the passage of time, and their originators did not know why they were true, but their survival over centuries attests to their general validity. Use them, with caution, and adapt them to local waters.

##### MACKEREL SKIES AND MARES’ TAILSMAKE TALL SHIPS CARRY LOW SAILS.

If high-flying cirrus clouds are few in the sky and resemble wisps in a mare’s tail in the wind, this is a sign of fair weather. Only when the sky becomes heavy with cirrus, or with mackerel, clouds—cirrocumulus that resemble wave-rippled sand on a beach—can you expect a storm. There is an exception to the mare’s tail proverb, however. If cirrus clouds form as mare’s tails with the hairs pointing upward or downward, the probability is for rain, even though the clouds may be scattered.

### Wind Observations

Sailboat skippers are familiar with the wind direction indicators that can be mounted at the masthead, and these are now often seen on medium-size and larger powerboats. Because a boat anchored or underway can head in any direction all around the compass, a few mental calculations are necessary before we can use this indicator, a yarn, an owner’s flag, or club burgee to determine the true direction of the wind. At anchor, the fly will give us the bearing of the wind relative to the boat’s bow; this must be converted to the true bearing of the wind itself. We can use our compass to obtain these values, provided we know its deviation on our heading and know the variation for our anchorage. In addition, we need to remember that wind direction is always stated as the true direction from which, not toward which, the wind is blowing.

For measuring wind strength we need something else. This is an anemometer; the principal parts of the instrument are illustrated in Figure 24-25, upper. The anemometer is essentially a speedometer. It consists of a rotor with hemispherical or conical cups attached to the ends of the spokes. It is designed for mounting at the masthead, where the wind is caught by the cups and causes them to turn at a speed proportional to wind speed. Indications of the rotor’s speed are electrically transmitted to an indicator mounted at the helm or in the cabin on your boat. In the type of instrument illustrated in Figure 24-25, lower, the indicator is direct reading, with its scale marked both in knots (0 to 50) and Beaufort force numbers (0 to 12); see below. Battery drain (0.09A) is insignificant. A 60-foot (18-m) cable is supplied to connect the rotor aloft with the illuminated indicator below. At anchor, the reading is the actual or true wind velocity at masthead height.

Figure 24-25 An anemometer rotor is shown above on this sailboat’s masthead fixture. It is connected by a cable to an indicator, usually mounted in the cockpit or at the navigator’s position. The display unit shown here, lower, also receives GPS course and speed input and is therefore able to convert apparent wind speed to true wind on demand. The needle shows the apparent wind angle.

Models are available that have a digital display and can “remember” the maximum wind velocity since the last time that it was reset. Such instruments can also measure temperature and combine that data with wind speed to display a value for wind chill.

##### RED SKY AT MORNING SAILORS TAKE WARNING; RED SKY AT NIGHT SAILOR’S DELIGHT.

There is a simple explanation for this old and quite reliable proverb. A red sunset results from viewing the sun through dusty particles in the air, the nuclei necessary for the formation of rain. This air probably would reach an observer the following day. Since weather tends to flow west to east in most places, if tomorrow’s weather appears to the west as a line of wetness, the sun shining through the mass appears as a yellow or grayish orb. On the other hand if the weather lying to the west is dry, the sun will show at its reddish.

Red sky in the morning is caused by the rising, eastern sun lighting up the advance guard of high cirrus and cirrostratus, which will be followed later on by the lowering, frontal clouds. Red sky at night—a red-tinted sunset—often derives from the sky clearing at the western horizon, with the clouds overhead likely to pass before the night is done.

#### True & Apparent Wind

So far we have been considering the determination of the direction and speed of the wind while at anchor. Underway, the determination is more difficult. But the Oceanographic Office of the Navy has worked out the problem, so we may as well use their results. Table 24-2 is based on wind tables published in Bowditch. Using our true course and speed, we can determine from this table the approximate true wind direction and speed, provided we know the apparent direction and speed. Our wind indicator or owner’s flag will give the apparent direction and our anemometer will give us the apparent strength.

Table 24-2 This table will allow you to find the true force and direction of the wind from its apparent force and direction on a boat underway.

##### RAINBOW IN MORNING SAILORS TAKE WARNING; RAINBOW TOWARD NIGHT SAILOR’S DELIGHT.

This is also quite an old weather jingle, and a little reasoning, particularly in view of the explanation about the “red sky at morning” saying, would tell you it is true.

As noted, storm centers usually move from the west. Thus, a morning rainbow would have to be viewed from its position already in the west with the sun shining on it from the east. (A rainbow is always seen in a direction opposite to the sun.) The storm would move in your direction, and you could confidently expect rain. A late-afternoon rainbow, however, viewed toward the east, would tell you that the storm has already passed.

#### The Beaufort Scale

Another method is to estimate the strength of the wind in terms of the Beaufort scale of wind force. Visually we can observe the sea condition and note the Beaufort number to which it corresponds; see Table 24-3. The range of wind speed represented by each force number on the Beaufort scale is shown in knots, statute miles per hour, and kilometers per hour in the table. Wind direction can also be judged by observing the direction from which the smallest ripples are coming since these ripples always run with the wind, responding instantly to changes in wind direction; see Figure 24-26.

Table 24-3 This table is based roughly on a scale for estimating wind speeds developed in 1805 by Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort of the British Royal Navy. The original Beaufort Scale was based on the effect of various wind speeds on the amount of sail that a full-rigged ship could carry. It has since been modified and modernized.

You don’t need to determine wind direction and strength with great precision, but reasonable estimates are helpful in preparing your own local forecasts. Estimating direction within 15 degrees is sufficient and within one Beaufort number is enough for strength. By observing wind direction and speed regularly and making a record of them, you can obtain clues concerning potential weather developments as the wind shifts direction and changes its strength.

#### Wind Force & Its Effect on the Sea

Boaters frequently use the Beaufort scale to log wind speed and the condition of the sea, but too often the description of sea conditions relies on verbal statements like “moderate waves,” “large waves,” and “moderately high waves” (see Table 24-3, column for “Effects Observed on Water”) leaving the boaters pretty much “at sea” in trying to visualize exactly what these terms imply.

The British Meteorological Office has solved this problem by issuing a State of Sea card (M.O. 688A) with photographs to accompany each of the descriptions of 13 wind forces of the Beaufort scale. Thus an observer has a guide in estimating wind strength (in knots) when making weather reports or in logging sea conditions. Fetch, depth of water, swell, heavy rain, current, and the lag effect between the wind picking up and the sea increasing may also affect the appearance of the sea. Range of wind speed and the mean wind speed are given for each force. By special permission, we reproduce six of these photographs (Forces 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12); refer to Figure 24-26. Forces 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 11, though not illustrated, may be estimated in relation to those above and below them in the scale.

Figure 24-26 Photographs taken from a National Weather Service NOAA publication show wind forces and their effect on open waters. Beaufort Force 1 (calm air) is shown at upper left. Force 3 (gentle breeze) is at upper right. Force 5 (fresh breeze) appears at center left. Force 8 (gale) is at center right. Force 10 (storm) is shown at lower left. Finally, at lower right is Force 12 (hurricane); note that in hurricane-force winds the surface of the sea may be completely obscured by driving foam.

##### THE BUYS-BALLOT’S LAW

Christophorus Buys-Ballot, a Dutch meteorologist, used the direction of the swirl of the wind in a low-pressure cell to find the center of a storm. In 1858, he formulated a law stating that winds are perpendicular to the lines of barometric slope. Two years later, he put his observations into a paper entitled Some Rules for Predicting Weather Changes in the Netherlands. In that paper was his well-known rule, “with your back to the wind, low pressure is to the left, higher pressure to the right.” (In the southern hemisphere, you would face the wind to find the low-pressure center with your left hand.) The application of this law has enabled many sailors to head for calmer waters.

##### RAINBOW TO WINDWARD, FOUL FALL THE DAY; RAINBOW TO LEEWARD, RAINS RUN AWAY.

This is another old seafarer’s saying about rainbows, but it is certainly worth remembering because it is almost infallibly true. If a rainbow is behind or with the direction of the prevailing wind, then you can expect its curtain of moisture to reach you. But if the rainbow appears to the lee of the wind, then you know rain has already passed and the gray line of showers is receding, moving away from you.

### Pressure Observations

Another weather instrument you should be familiar with is the aneroid barometer; see Figure 24-27. The one illustrated has several interesting features.

Figure 24-27 The barometer shown here has scales both in inches of mercury and in millibars. Markings such as “Rain,” “Change,” or “Fair” are traditional but are of little practical value.

First, there is the pressure scale. You probably are accustomed to thinking of barometric pressure in terms of inches of mercury, so the scale is graduated in these units. Weather reports and forecasts now use pressures shown in millibars, so another scale graduated in millibars helps. You thus would not have to worry about conversions between units.

The “standard atmospheric pressure” of 29.92 inches of mercury is equal to 1013.2 millibars; 1 inch equals 33.86 millibars, or 1 millibar equals 0.03 inches of mercury.

Second, it is a rugged instrument and it has a high order of accuracy. Third, it has a reference hand for keeping track of changes in pressure. The words “Fair-Change-Rain,” in themselves, when they appear on the face of an aneroid barometer, are decorative. It is not the actual barometric pressure that is important in forecasting; it is the direction and rate of change in pressure.

#### How a Barometer Is Used

A good barometer is a helpful instrument provided you read it at regular intervals and keep a record of the readings and provided you remember that there is much more to weather than barometric pressure alone.

An individual reading of the barometer tells you only the pressure being exerted by the atmosphere on the earth’s surface at a particular point of observation at that time. But suppose you have logged pressure readings at regular intervals as follows:

Time

Pressure

Change

0700

30.02

—

0800

30.00

-0.02

0900

29.97

-0.03

1000

29.93

-0.04

1100

29.88

-0.05

1200

29.82

-0.06

The pressure is falling, and it is falling at an increasing rate. Trouble is brewing. A fall of 0.02 inch per hour is a low rate of fall; consequently, this figure would not be particularly disturbing. But a fall of 0.05 inch per hour is a rather high rate.

Next, there is a normal daily change in pressure. The pressure is usually at its daily maximums about 1000 and 2200 and at its daily minimums about 0400 and 1600. The variation between minimum and maximum may be as much as 0.05 inch change in these six-hour intervals (about 0.01 inch change per hour). Thus, when the pressure normally would increase about 0.03 inch (0700 to 1000) our pressure actually must have fallen 0.09 inch.

Suppose, now, that at about 1200 you also observed that the wind was blowing from the NE with increasing force and that the barometer continued to fall at a high rate. A severe northeast gale is probably on its way. On the other hand, given the same barometer reading of about 29.80, rising rapidly with the wind going to west, you could expect improving weather. Quite a difference!

#### Barometric Changes & Wind Velocity

Let us now relate barometric changes to wind velocity. First, it is generally true that a rapidly falling barometer forecasts the development of strong winds. This is so because a falling barometer indicates the approach or development of a low, and the pressure gradient is usually steep in the neighborhood of a low-pressure center. On the other hand, a rising barometer is associated with the prospect of lighter winds to come. This is true because a rising barometer indicates the approach or development of a high, and the pressure gradient is characteristically smaller in the neighborhood of a high-pressure center.

The barometer does not necessarily fall before or during a strong breeze. The wind often blows hard without any appreciable accompanying change in the barometer. This means that a steep pressure gradient exists (isobars close together, as seen on the weather map), but that the well-developed high or low associated with the steep pressure gradient is practically stationary. In this case the wind may be expected to blow hard for some time; any slackening or change will take place gradually.

It not infrequently happens that the barometer falls quite rapidly, yet the wind remains comparatively light. If you remember the relation between wind velocity and pressure gradient, you can conclude that the gradient must be comparatively small (isobars relatively far apart). The rapid fall of the barometer must be accounted for, then, in either one or two ways. Either a low with a weak pressure gradient on its forward side is approaching rapidly, or there is a rapid decrease of pressure taking place over the surrounding area, or both. In such a situation, the pressure gradient at the rear of the low is often steep, and in that case, strong winds will set in as soon as the barometer commences to rise. (It will rise rapidly under these circumstances.) The fact that the barometer is now rising, however, indicates that decreasing winds may be expected soon.

##### ELECTRONIC BAROMETERS

In this age of high-tech electronic devices on boats, there are now electronic barometers. These can provide an easily read digital display of atmospheric pressure plus an expanded history of changes that occurred at regular intervals over the previous hours. Audible alarms can be set to sound at preset low pressures or for falling pressure at a selected rate. Time and temperature can also be continuously displayed. These units are powered by an internal battery and may be placed anywhere convenient.

##### A BACKING WIND SAYS STORMS ARE NIGH; BUT A VEERING WIND WILL CLEAR THE SKY.

This folklore observation generally refers to storms running in a southerly direction.

##### APPEARANCE OF THE MOON PROVERBS

The shape and color of the moon as indica tors of coming weather changes have long been a subject of controversy—mostly among those meteorological experts who declare that the moon has no appreciable control over the weather beyond a very small tidal effect on the atmosphere. But for now, let’s be content with the observation that as far as weather portents are concerned, the moon is one of the most visible and absolutely reliable signs of weather change. It is not the moon’s influence that makes the following sayings ring with truth, it is other atmospheric conditions that influence the moon’s appearance.

#### The Barometer & Wind Shifts

Nearly all extra-tropical cyclones display an asymmetrical distribution of pressure. The pressure gradients are seldom the same in the front and rear of an extra-tropical cyclone. During the approach of a low, the barometer alone gives no clue as to how much the wind will shift and what velocity it will have after the passage of the low-pressure system. This is particularly applicable to situations in which the wind blows from a southerly direction while the barometer is falling. The cessation of the fall of the barometer will coincide with a veering (gradual or sudden) shift of the wind to a more westerly direction. Unfortunately, if you have no information other than the variations in atmospheric pressure indicated by your barometer, you cannot foretell the exact features of the change.

In using barometric indications for local forecasting, remember that weather changes are influenced by the characteristics of the earth’s surface in your locality. Check all rules against experience in your own cruising waters before you place full confidence in them.

### Temperature Observations

Thermometer readings will not give as much information for weather predicting as data from other instruments, but they are not without some value.

Cold air carried down from a thunderstorm cloud with the rain may be felt as much as three miles in advance of the storm itself. Thus, a warning is given and the approach of the storm is confirmed.

##### SHARP HORNS ON THE MOON THREATEN HIGH WINDS.

When you can clearly see the sharp horns or ends of a crescent moon with your naked eye, it means there are high-speed winds aloft that are sweeping away cloud forms. Inasmuch as these high winds always descend to earth, you can predict a windy day following.

#### Judging the Likelihood of Fog

In order to judge the likelihood of fog formation, you can periodically measure the air temperature and dew-point temperature and see if the spread (difference) between them is getting smaller.

A graph derived from a series of air and dew-point temperatures (see this page) is shown in Figure 24-28. By recording these temperatures and plotting their spread over a period of several hours, you will have a basis for forecasting the time at which you are likely to be fog-bound. This entire curve represents actual data, but it could just as easily have been completed late Friday evening by extrapolating forward from the observations recorded to that point. If an error were made in this extrapolation, it would probably indicate that the fog would form at an earlier hour. This is on the safe side; you would be secure in your anchorage sometime before the 59th minute of the 11th hour.

Figure 24-28 Shown here is a plot of a series of air and dew point temperatures at hourly intervals based on the values in the table, inset. Indications of the density of fog at various times are also shown.

Note that while the average decrease in spread is about 1.5°F per hour, the decrease is at a much greater rate in the earlier hours of the day. So long as you do not make unreasonable allowances for a slowing up in the rate of change of the spread, this also will help keep you on the safe side.

##### WHEN A HALO RINGS THE MOON OR SUN THE RAIN WILL COME UPON THE RUN.

Halos are excellent atmospheric signs of rain. Halos around the moon after a pale sun confirm the advent of rain, for you are viewing the moon through the ice crystals of high cirriform clouds. When the whole sky is covered with these cloud forms, a warm front is approaching, bringing a long, soft rain.

##### GENERAL BAROMETER RULES

• Foul weather is usually forecast by a falling barometer with winds from the east quadrant.

• Except after a wintertime cold frontal passage in a relatively warm marine area, clearing and fair weather is usually forecast by winds shifting to west quadrants from a rising barometer.

• When the wind sets in from points between south and southeast and the barometer falls steadily, a storm is approaching from the west or northwest, and its center will pass near or north of the observer within 12 or 24 hours, with the wind veering to northwest by way of south and southwest.

• When the wind sets in from points between east and northeast and the barometer starts to fall steadily, a storm is approaching from the south or southwest, and its center will pass near or to the south of the observer within 12 or 24 hours, with the wind backing to northwest by way of north.

• The rapidity of a storm’s approach and the storm’s likely intensity will be indicated by the rate and amount of fall in the barometer.

• A falling barometer and a rising thermometer often forecast precipitation.

• Barometer and thermometer rising together often forecast fine weather.

• A slowly rising barometer forecasts settled weather.

• A steady, slow fall of pressure indicates forthcoming unsettled or wet weather.

#### Determining the Dew Point

You can determine the dew point by means of a simple-to-operate, inexpensive device known as a sling psychrometer; see Figure 24-29. A sling psychrometer consists of two thermometers mounted in a single holder with a handle that permits it to be whirled overhead. One thermometer, known as the dry bulb, has its bulb of mercury exposed directly to the air and thus shows the actual temperature of the air. The other thermometer, the wet bulb, has its bulb covered with a piece of gauze; soak this gauze in fresh water so that the bulb is moistened. If the air is not saturated with water vapor, evaporation then takes place from the wet-bulb thermometer as it is whirled and, since the process of evaporation requires the expenditure of heat, the wet bulb is cooled. Continue whirling until it can be lowered no longer. The reduced temperature shown by the wet-bulb thermometer, the wet-bulb temperature, thus represents the lowest temperature to which the air can be cooled by evaporating water into it.

Figure 24-29 This pocket-type sling psychrometer has two 5-inch tubes, etched with divisions reading from 20 degrees to 120 degrees Fahrenheit.

When you whirl the psychrometer you create a draft around it, thereby increasing the efficiency of the evaporation process and making the wet bulb more reliable than it would be with little or no air movement past it—hence the psychrometer’s design for whirling.

From the wet-bulb and dry-bulb temperatures, you can determine the dew point by referring to a suitable table. As you are far more interested in knowing the spread between air temperature and dew point, however, use Table 24-4, explained below.

Table 24-4 This table will allow you to use the air temperature as shown by the dry-bulb thermometer of a sling Psychrometer and the difference between that reading and the wet-bulb reading to determine dew-point spread. All figures are in degrees Fahrenheit at 30 inches barometric pressure.

If the air is already saturated with water vapor, no water can evaporate from the gauze and both thermometers will show the same value. The spread between air temperature and dew point is zero. But if the air is not already saturated with water vapor, subtract the wet-bulb temperature from the dry-bulb temperature. With this difference and the dry-bulb (the air) temperature, consult Table 24-4 and find the corresponding spread between the air temperature and the dew-point temperature. This is the figure you want.

If, in the late afternoon or early evening, the spread between the air temperature and dew point is less than approximately 6°F, and the air temperature is falling, you will probably encounter fog or greatly restricted visibility in a few hours. These critical values are emphasized by the heavy line below them in Table 24-4.

Incidentally, should you ever want to know the dew-point temperature itself, all you need do is to subtract the spread figure given in the table from the temperature shown by the dry-bulb thermometer. The formula used for converting Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius temperature is: (°F-32) x 0.56 = °C.

##### WHEN BOAT HORNS SOUND HOLLOW, RAIN WILL SURELY FOLLOW.

Anyone who has spent any time around boats knows the truth of this time-honored prophecy. Nor do you have to be sitting on a piling in a marina to notice the unusual sharpness of sounds on certain days—the more penetrating sound of a bell ringing or voices that carry longer distances are signs of the acoustical clarity that results from bad weather lowering the cloud ceiling toward the earth. The tonal quality of sound is improved because the cloud layer bounces the sounds back, the way the walls of a canyon echo a cry. When the cloud barrier lifts, the same clouds dissipate in space.

##### A HALO AROUND THE SUN INDICATES THE APPROACH OF A STORM WITHIN THREE DAYS, FROM THE SIDE WHICH IS THE MOST BRILLIANT.

HALOS PREDICT A STORM AT NOT GREAT DISTANCE, AND THE OPEN SIDE OF THE HALO TELLS THE QUARTER FROM WHICH IT MAY BE EXPECTED.

These two sayings at first reading may seem contradictory, but they are more explicit in their forecasting than the simple “halo rings the moon” saying. As cirrus and cirrostratus fronts push across the sky in the region of the moon or sun, the halo first appears and subsequently becomes brightest in that part of the arc from which a low-pressure system is approaching. Later, the halo becomes complete and the light is uniform throughout. As the storm advances, altostratus clouds arrive and obliterate the original, and for a time, the brightest part of the halo—that is, the side nearest the oncoming storm. Both sayings are useful, but they refer to different times in the life of the halo.

It is also true that when halos are double or triple, they signify that cirrostratus clouds are relatively thick, such as would be the case in a deep and well-developed storm. Broken halos indicate a much disturbed state in the upper atmosphere, with rain close at hand.

Now, to put any confusion to rest about the forecast persistence of rain by the appearance of sun and moon halos, the U.S. Weather Service has verified through repeated observations that sun halos will be followed by rain about 75 percent of the time. Halos around the moon have a rain forecasting accuracy of about 65 percent.

##### LIGHTNING FROM THE WEST OR NORTHWEST WILL REACH YOU, LIGHTNING FROM THE SOUTH OR SOUTHEAST WILL PASS YOU BY.

This is a true saying, if you live in the North Temperate Zone. Lightning comes hand in hand with storm clouds, and thunderheads always loom over the horizon from the west or northwest and usually move east. So lightning anywhere from the south or southeast will pass you by.

### The Weather Log

Although the latest Weather Service forecasts are readily available via various media, it is often helpful to record your own cloud and weather observations. You can then check the reliability of the latest prediction. Occasionally, the professional forecaster misjudges the future rate of travel of the weather pattern, which may move faster or slower than anticipated. Or a new, unforeseen development in the pattern may occur.

A form of weather log that is suitable for use on recreational boats is shown in Figure 24-30, left. This is the front sheet; Figure 24-30, right, shows the reverse side. The first weather items recorded are based on a reading of the latest weather map (if available) and a summary of any radio reports received. Then use the reverse side to jot down your local observations. Sufficient columns are available to permit the entry of these data six times during one 24-hour day, at four-hour intervals. Entries may be made using standard weather code symbols or any other method you choose, provided you use the same system consistently.

Figure 24-30 A weather log of this general format, left, can be used to record information developed from weather maps, or received by radio, and the forecast developed from this data. The reverse side, right, is used for local weather observations. By recording this information and keeping the record, it is possible to develop considerable skill in making forecasts.

From these records you can estimate how and to what extent the actual weather during the next few hours might differ from those predicted in the official forecast.

Using readily available communications technology, a boater can forward significant weather observations to the Weather Service at www.nws.noaa.gov. This is one way the boating public has of improving forecasts and warnings in the marine environment.

##### SOUND TRAVELING FAR AND WIDE A STORMY DAY DOES LIKE BETIDE.

This is another (English) version of the saying about “sound” and bad weather; this one suggests that you actually can hear bad weather approaching, say, when a faraway train whistle is audible when normally it would be faint. The reason the sound carries farther is that the whistle was blown under a lowering cloud ceiling whose extending barrier may not have reached your position yet.

# CHAPTER25

Figure 25-01 It is courteous for a faster boat to slow down when passing a slower craft. Such passing will be accomplished most comfortably if the slower boat also slows down in order that the faster craft can pass at a true “no-wake” speed. This is not considered a violation of the Navigation Rules requirement that an overtaken vessel must “maintain course and speed.”

BOATING CUSTOMS

Courtesy Afloat • The Etiquette of Flags, Afloat & Ashore

Boating today is an informal kind of recreation, no longer bound to the ceremonies of “yachting etiquette.” However, there are many occasions when proper observances are expected, even if only as common courtesy to your boating neighbors.

You need not belong to a yacht club, but it helps to understand club practices that you might encounter. You should be able to recognize a race in progress, for example, and take steps to avoid it. Likewise, you should be able to drop your hook in an anchorage, or make fast at a marina, or raft up with other boats without causing friction. Every boater should know the proper procedures for displaying flags.

This chapter covers boating customs, as they exist today. In the main, they simply represent good sense and good manners afloat.

## COURTESY AFLOAT

Except when cruising the high seas, or on some remote inland waters, you will generally be boating within sight of other boats. Often you will be close enough that any maneuvers you make, even activities on board your boat, will have an impact on others. Some actions are beyond those required by the Navigation Rules. The situations suggested below are a matter of good manners, of causing the least interference to the vessel with the most limited maneuverability.

### When Underway

A faster boat overtaking a slower one in restricted waters, such as a channel or narrow river, should slow down sufficiently to cause no damage or discomfort. Often overlooked is that it may be necessary for the slower boat itself to reduce speed. For example, if the slower boat is making 8 knots, the faster boat can slow only to about 10 knots in order to have enough speed differential left to get past. But at that speed the passing boat may make a wake that is uncomfortable to the other craft. The overtaken boat should slow to about 4 knots, or even less, to allow the other boat to pass at 5 or 6 knots with little wake; see Figure 25-01.

If an adequate depth of water extends outward on one or both sides of the course, it is courteous for the passing boat to swing well out to a safe side in order to minimize the discomfort to the overtaken boat. A powerboat should pass a sailboat well to leeward, or astern if it is in a crossing situation, so as to not disturb the flow of air on its sails; refer to this page.

### Near Regattas & Other Events

A fleet of sailboats all headed in the same general direction is a sure indication of a race in progress. While it might be possible to pass through such a fleet “legally,” observing the proper Navigation Rules, this action might interfere with the courses and tactics of the racing skippers. Stay well clear so that neither your wake nor your “wind shadow” will have any effect on the race boats.

Although cruising-type sailboats engaged in a long-distance race may not be as easy to identify as competitors in a local event, whether such a boat is racing or just cruising, it is best to take no action that would interfere with its progress.

Marine parades, powerboat races, and other such types of event may be held—with a regatta permit from the U.S. Coast Guard—in waters that are otherwise subject to normal marine traffic. The Coast Guard, USCG Auxiliary, or the organization sponsoring the event may provide patrol boats to keep nonparticipating craft clear of the event; see Figure 25-02. You must obey instructions given from any such patrol boat. In addition to the danger in blundering out into the path of speeding race boats, it is discourteous to interfere with the performance of any regatta.

Figure 25-02 Boating waters are patrolled by many different law-enforcement craft. These may be boats of the Coast Guard, USCG Auxiliary, or state or local police agencies. Whatever the source of the patrolling craft, instructions and orders from them must be promptly obeyed.

### Anchorages, Moorings & Marinas

Be a good boating neighbor when you drop the hook in an anchorage, lie at a mooring, or make fast at a yacht club or marina pier. Enter an anchorage dead slow; a wake that upsets someone’s dinner or drink will not win friends among other boaters; see Figure 25-03. In addition, refrain from the unnecessary use of your searchlight. Avoid anchoring too close to other boats: Keep in mind that when a wind shift changes the boats’ positions, anchor rodes can foul in a matter of minutes, and hulls can be damaged if they bang together. Remember the first boat to anchor has a right to an appropriate swinging radius. Also consider the state of the tide and the effect of its range on your swinging radius. If a guest mooring is open, use it only after you have obtained permission; it may be reserved for another boat, or it may be unsuitable for your craft. At fuel piers, make fast to them only briefly. When others are waiting, never use fueling time as an opportunity to make a trip to the store. Likewise, when boating in some saltwater areas, avoid using a marina’s limited freshwater reserves to wash your boat without first asking for permission.

Figure 25-03 When entering an area where other craft are anchored or on moorings, do so at a dead slow speed with no wake.

In the evening hours, take care not to disturb people on other boats in the area. Sound travels exceptionally well across water, and many cruising boat crews turn in early for dawn departures. You should resist the temptation to visit among the other boats with a dinghy and outboard motor. The quiet of using oars will be appreciated by others. Make sure that those aboard your boat keep their voices down and play music only at low levels. Remember that any comments you make about other boats will carry as well. If you are one of the early departees, leave the mooring with an absolute minimum of noise, and again, at dead slow speed.

When rafting, the boat that will be last to leave is the one to take the mooring, lie alongside the pier or wharf, or drop the anchor (provided that its ground tackle is adequate). The others should make fast in order of departure, so that the first to leave will be farthest outboard. This is only common sense—but it must be remembered; see Figure 25-04.

Figure 25-04 When two or more boats are rafted, the boat at the anchor (according to plan, the last one to depart) must have adequate ground tackle. All rafted boats should be well protected by fenders.

Don’t throw trash and garbage overboard; even if it is biodegradable, it is unsightly and illegal. Secure any slapping halyards; they can be a most annoying source of noise (and can chafe the surface of the mast). Dogs should be well trained to avoid barking in an anchorage. Exercise them ashore in authorized areas, or well away from normal traffic areas; make sure you pick up after your pet; see Figure 25-05. When you go ashore, for whatever reason, leave the area as you found it—or even cleaner. Observe all signs and regulations, extinguish fires, and dispose of refuse only if permitted.

Figure 25-05 Whether on the water for a day, or departing for an extended cruise, taking the family pet along presents extra responsibilities. Fair weather or foul, you must be prepared to take a dog ashore periodically—and to clean up after it.

### Cruising in Company

Your VHF/DSC radio’s group calling feature makes it easy to communicate with all the vessels in a flotilla. The group creates its own group calling mmsi; the number 0 followed by 366 (for U.S. vessels), followed by 5 digits (for example, 036655555). A group call to this MMSI will alert all radios in range that have been programmed with this number, tell them the location of the calling vessel and cause them to automatically switch to the working channel designated by the calling vessel. Any vessel in the group can initiate a group call. Communication with individual vessels can be established by hailing them using their unique MMSIs. Using DSC hailing eliminates the need to call on Channel 16.

### Clubs & Organizations

If you are a member of a recognized yacht club, often other yacht clubs will extend you courtesies—the use of guest slips, moorings, and clubhouse facilities, for example. Remember, though, that proper procedure requires asking permission to use such facilities, even if you wish to make fast briefly at the club dock to pick up a member who is planning to join you.

When visiting a yacht club of which you are not a member, take the time to inform yourself about the actions and routines of the local owner-members and club officers. This can be especially important in respect to evening “colors,” the lowering of flags: Remember that not all clubs strictly calculate the daily time of sunset, and some sunset signals for colors may be earlier than you would normally expect; see Figure 25-06.

Figure 25-06 The national ensign should always be raised briskly in the morning but lowered slowly and ceremoniously at sunset. Other flags are raised after the U.S. flag and lowered before it.

Yacht clubs and organizations such as the United States Power Squadrons generally have by-laws or handbooks that spell out requirements for ceremonial procedures, such as the exchange of salutes, daily color ceremonies, salutes between vessels, precedence in boarding or leaving launches, and flag courtesies.

In many cases an 0800 gun is sounded as a signal to raise colors and a sunset gun for lowering colors. If you expect to be away from your boat at the time of sunset, take in the applicable flags before you leave the boat.

If hired personnel are not on hand when a boat is coming in to make fast near your position, it is good manners to offer to help with the docking lines; see Figure 25-07. Always ask permission before boarding another boat. As for approaching an anchored or moored boat in your dinghy or tender, traditional naval practice suggests pulling alongside that boat’s starboard side.

Figure 25-07 If there are no club or marina employees around, it is always a friendly and helpful action to take a line from an arriving craft—many fine friendships have started from this simple act of courtesy.

## THE ETIQUETTE OF FLAGS

There is no legislation governing the flying of any flag on noncommercial vessels. However, through the years, customs have been established for the types of flags that may be flown and when and where they are to be displayed. In recent years, new procedures have evolved, such as flying the national ensign from the stern staff of a sailboat underway.

The term “colors” strictly applies only to the flag at the stern of a vessel to denote the boat’s nationality. In practice, however, it has come to be used for all flags flown and will be used in that context in this chapter.

In general, it is not considered proper practice to fly more than one flag on a single hoist. There are a few exceptions, however. Many vessels, because of their size or construction, cannot accommodate single hoisting; these may have a multiple hoist where necessary, with proper order of precedence observed—the more “senior” flags are flown above the others. If there is more than one hoist on a starboard spreader, they can be used, with the more “senior” flag on the outboard hoist.

U.S. Power Squadrons guidelines for flag display are given in Table 25-1. See “Flag Display Afloat,” on this page, which shows the flags, pennants, and burgees that may be flown from American-owned recreational boats, and the proper methods for their display.

Table 25-1 The United States Power Squadrons fulfills its mandate to provide information to the boating community at large by designing education aids, including the table above. This quick-reference guide identifies flags, pennants, and burgees that may be flown from U.S.-owned recreational boats and the proper methods for their display.

### Flying Various Flags

• The United States ensign is proper for all U.S. craft without reservation. This is “Old Glory,” with 50 stars and 13 stripes. It is flown from the stern staff of powerboats underway on inland waters. On the high seas it need be flown only when meeting or passing other vessels. If the powerboat has a mast and gaff, the proper display is at the gaff. On a sportfisherman, where a stern staff would be in the way of the action, the practice is to fly the ensign from a halyard rigged just behind the tuna tower, often on a short gaff.

On Marconi-rigged sailboats under sail alone, the practice for many years has been to fly the ensign from the leech of the aftermost sail, approximately two-thirds the length of the leech above the clew. This puts it in about the same position it would occupy if the boat were gaff-rigged, and on gaff-rigged sailboats it is still proper to fly the ensign from the peak of the aftermost gaff.

The advent of the modern high-aspect-ratio rig, with the boom end well inboard of the stern, has made it possible to fly the ensign from the stern staff of a sailboat underway, and this is now accepted practice. However, the ensign should never be displayed while the boat is racing. Under power alone, or at anchor or made fast, the ensign should be flown from the stern staff of all sailboats. If an overhanging boom requires that the staff be off-center, it should be on the starboard side.

• The United States yacht ensign is the red-and-white striped flag with a foul anchor in the blue canton within a circle of 13 stars. Originally restricted to documented yachts, it is now flown on recreational boats of all types and sizes instead of the national ensign. Some yacht clubs now have bylaws requiring that the U.S. yacht ensign be flown regardless of boat size or documentation status. However, when a boat is taken into international or foreign waters, the 50-star U.S. ensign is the proper flag to display, not the yacht ensign, which is not a “national” flag.

• The United States Power Squadrons ensign, blue and white vertical stripes with a red canton having a foul anchor in a circle of stars, is flown as a signal that the boat is commanded by a USPS member in good standing. The USPS is a national organization of boaters dedicated to better and safer boating through education and civic service.

The preferred location for flying the USPS ensign is the starboard yardarm or spreader, underway, at anchor, or made fast to shore, on both motor and sailing craft. It may be flown from the stern staff in place of the U.S. or yacht ensign, but this is only for U.S. waters, and is usually done only on smaller boats that lack a mast. On sailboats underway, it may be flown from the aftermost peak or leech in place of other ensigns.

The USPS ensign may be flown at its proper location on boats displaying the USCG Auxiliary ensign to indicate that the owner is a member of both organizations; however, it cannot be flown if the craft is under U.S. Coast Guard orders.

• The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary ensign, known as the blue ensign, is flown on a boat that has been approved as a “facility” by the organization for the current year. This flag is flown both day and night.

On a vessel without a mast, the blue ensign is flown at the bow staff; if there is one mast, it is flown at the masthead. On a vessel with two or more masts, the USCG Auxiliary ensign is displayed at the main masthead. It is never flown in place of the national ensign.

When this ensign is displayed, it is improper to hoist a guest, owner absent, cocktail, or other novelty flag. (Guest flags are rarely used.)

• The United States Coast Guard Auxiliary operational ensign is only flown by the boat of a member of the USCG Auxiliary that meets a particularly high standard of equipment and availability, called an operational facility, and that is called on for use under Coast Guard orders in assistance and patrol missions. The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary operational ensign is white with the Coast Guard’s racing stripes of red and blue—in place of the blue ensign.

• The yacht club burgee is generally triangular in shape, although sometimes swallow-tailed; a yacht club burgee may be flown by day only, or by day and night, as specified by the individual club. It is flown from the bow staff of mastless and single-masted powerboats, at the foremost masthead of vessels with two or more masts, and the main masthead of ketches or yawls. The burgee may be flown while underway (but not racing) and at anchor. You may substitute the owner’s private signal (see below) for the burgee on single-masted yachts without bow staff, when the boat is underway. See also www.burgees.com.

• The burgee of a specific power squadron, which has been authorized by the USPS national secretary, may be flown in lieu of a club burgee and from the same positions. It may be flown by day only, or both day and night.

• An owner’s private signal is generally swallow-tailed in shape, but it may be rectangular or pennant shaped. It is flown from the masthead of a single-masted motorboat or sailboat, or from the aftermost masthead of a power or sailing vessel with two or more masts. It may be flown by day only, or day and night.

A mastless motorboat may fly this signal from the bow staff in place of a club burgee.

• Officers’ flags designating yacht club or USPS officers are rectangular. They are blue (with white design) for senior officers; red for next lower in rank; and white (with blue design) for lower ranks. Other officers’ flags (except fleet captain and fleet surgeon) may be swallow-tailed or triangular in shape, as provided in the regulations of those organizations making provisions for such flags.

An officer’s flag is flown in place of the owner’s private signal on all rigs of motor and sailing vessels except single-masted sailboats, when it is flown in place of the club burgee at the masthead. On smaller motorboats without a signal mast, a USPS officer flag may be flown from a radio antenna either singly or beneath the USPS ensign.

• A USCG Auxiliary officer flag flies day and night when the officer is on board. On a vessel without a mast, it is flown at the bow staff in place of the Auxiliary ensign; on a vessel with a mast, it is flown at the starboard spreader. Past officers’ burgees are displayed in the same manner.

Only one officer’s flag may be flown at a time, and an incumbent officer’s flag invariably takes precedence.

### Size of Flags

Although flags come in a fixed, standardized series of sizes, there are guidelines that will help in selecting the proper size for your boat.

Keeping in mind that flags are more often too small than too large, use the rules given below and round upward to the nearest larger standard size:

The flag at the stern of your boat—U.S. ensign, yacht ensign, or USPS ensign—should be one inch on the fly for each foot of overall length. The hoist will normally be two-thirds of the fly, but some flags such as the USCG Auxiliary ensign have different proportions; refer to Chapter 1, Figure 1-32.

Other flags such as club burgees, officers’ flags, and private signals for use on sailboats should be approximately ½ inch on the fly for each foot of the highest mast above the water. For flying on powerboats, these flags should be roughly ⅝ inch on the fly for each foot of overall length. The shape and proportions of pennants and burgees will be prescribed by the appropriate organization to which they relate. A Union Jack should be the same size as the corresponding portion of the national ensign.

Not all flags available for purchase in the U.S. have the correct proportions—this is particularly true of the flags of some foreign nations; a ratio of 1:2 for hoist to fly is quite common. Information on the proper dimensions can usually be obtained from encyclopedias, from consulates or embassies, or on the Internet. If you intend to purchase a foreign flag to be used as a courtesy flag on arrival in that country’s waters, try to get one that is of the correct shape; also remember that some nations, such as the Bahamas, use a different flag for vessels than the one flown on land. Federal law prescribes the dimensions of U.S. flags to be used by governmental agencies in terms of 11 numbered sizes. The basic proportions of the U.S. national flag are 10:19 (not 3:5 as you will find in most stores), but there are some numbered sizes with quite different ratios.

### Raising & Lowering Flags

“Colors are made” each morning at 0800; as mentioned, at yacht club and similar organization docks or anchorages, this may be signaled by a morning gun. The national ensign or yacht ensign is first hoisted at the stern (or set in place on its staff). This is followed by the USPS ensign at the starboard spreader (if not already flying on a day-and-night basis), provided the skipper is a USPS member. Then comes the club burgee or Squadron pennant at the bow, and the private signal at the masthead. (An officer’s flag, if flown in place of a private signal, would be flown continuously.)

If the boat bears a valid USCG Auxiliary Facility decal, it would be flying the Auxiliary ensign at the masthead, day and night. The USCG Auxiliary officer’s pennant or burgee may be flown, day and night, at the starboard spreader. On smaller craft, the same sequence should be followed, with the flags on their staffs being set in the appropriate locations as illustrated in the sidebar, “Flag Display Afloat,” on this page.

At sunset, colors not properly flown on a day-and-night basis should be lowered in reverse sequence, the ensign at the stern always being the last to be secured.

### Dressing Ship

On national holidays, at regattas, and on other special occasions, yachts often “dress ship” with International Code signal flags. Officers’ flags, club burgees, and national flags are flown normally. A vessel is dressed at 0800, and remains so dressed until evening colors (while at anchor only, except for a vessel’s maiden and final voyages, and participation in a marine parade or other unique situation).

In dressing ship, the national ensign is hoisted at the stern staff, and the Union Jack may be displayed at the jack (bow) staff. A rainbow of flags of the International Code is arranged, reaching from the waterline forward to the waterline aft, by way of the bowsprit end (or stem if no bowsprit exists) and the masthead(s); see Figure 25-08. Flags and pennants are bent on alternately, rather than in an indiscriminate manner. Since there are twice as many letter flags as numeral pennants, it is good practice, as in the Navy, to follow a sequence of two flags, one pennant, two flags, one pennant, throughout. The sequence recommended here provides a harmonious color pattern throughout. Staring from the bow: AB2, UJ1, KE3, GH6, IV5, FL4, DM7, PO Third Repeater, RN First Repeater, ST Zero, CX9, WQ8, ZY Second Repeater.

Figure 25-08 “Dressing ship” can add a fine touch of ceremony to the proper yachting event. International Code flags and pennants are strung from the water’s edge at the bow across the boat to the water’s edge aft. The proper sequence of flags and pennants is given in the text.

### Honoring Other National Flags

As a matter of courtesy, it is proper to fly the flag of a foreign nation on your boat when you enter and operate on its waters. There are only a limited number of positions from which flags may be flown; consequently, when a courtesy flag of another nation is flown, it usually must displace one of the flags commonly displayed in home waters. It is normally not hoisted until clearance has been completed and the yellow “Q” flag has been removed.

The following are general guidelines to follow regarding courtesy flags:

• On a mastless powerboat, the courtesy flag of another nation is now most commonly flown from a radio antenna on the starboard side (the most forward antenna if there is more than one on that side). This approximates the location of a starboard spreader of a mast.

• When a motorboat has a mast with spreaders, the courtesy flag is flown at the starboard spreader.

• On a two-masted motorboat, the courtesy flag displaces any flag normally flown at the forward starboard spreader.

• On a sailboat, the courtesy flag is flown at the boat’s starboard spreader, whether the United States ensign is at the stern staff or is flown from the leech. If there is more than one mast, the courtesy flag is flown from the starboard spreader of the forward mast.

• No other flag should ever be flown on the same halyard as a courtesy flag, nor on a halyard outboard of one.

Although these points serve as protocol in most waters, keep in mind that customs observed in various foreign waters differ from one another; in case of doubt, inquire locally or observe other craft from your country.

As noted previously, it is proper for U.S. vessels while in international or foreign waters to fly the U.S. ensign (50-star flag) at the stern, gaff, or leech, rather than the yacht ensign or the USPS ensign. When the starboard spreader is used for the courtesy ensign of the foreign country, the USPS ensign or similar flag may be flown from the port spreader; if the vessel has multiple flag halyards on the starboard spreader, the USPS ensign is flown there, inboard from the courtesy ensign.

The U.S. ensign, club burgee, officer’s flag, and private signal are flown as in home waters.

Do not fly a foreign courtesy ensign after you have returned to U.S. waters. Although this may show that you’ve “been there,” it is not proper flag etiquette.

##### FLYING NATIONAL & YACHTING FLAGS

Flags are flown aboard boats and on shore to convey a variety of information to the boating community. An ensign—the national flag—identifies the country of registration. A burgee indicates a yacht club or boating organization of which the boat owner is a member. Other flags give information about the owner—office held in a club or organization, for example. A pennant, such as some of those shown in “Flag Display Afloat,” on this page and this page, is generally a signal flag. The flags shown below include flags commonly seen on boats in North America.

U.S NATIONAL ENSIGN & MERCHANT FLAG

is flown from the stern staff of all boats at anchor and underway according to the circumstances (see this page).

U.S. YACHT ENSIGN

May be flown on noncommercial craft, except in international or foreign waters.

U.S. CUSTOMS FLAG

Flown at every U.S. Customs Service office.

U.S. COAST GUARD ENSIGN

Flown day and night on active USCG units afloat or ashore.

MEXICAN NATIONAL ENSIGN

Identifies Mexican vessels.

CANADIAN NATIONAL ENSIGN

Identifies Canadian vessels—naval, merchant, or recreational—and Canadian Customs offices.

BAHAMIAN CIVIL ENSIGN

Flown by ships and boats of all sizes; different from flag flown ashore.

YACHT CLUB BURGEE (TYPICAL)

Usually triangular in shape; design varies widely.

YACHT CLUB COMMODORE’S FLAG

Identifies commodore’s boat or presence ashore.

YACHT PRIVATE SIGNAL

Individual yacht owners may have their own flags; the one above is typical.

POWER SQUADRONS BURGEE (TYPICAL)

Design varies widely.

TRANSPORTATION OR TENDER FLAG

Is used to request launch service boats and an International Code flag “T.”

DIVER’S FLAG

Generally flown on a boat hosting divers or on a small float near a diver, warns other crafts to “stay clear.”

RIGID REPLICA OF INTERNATIONAL CODE FLAG “A”

Signals underwater operations as specified in the Navigation Rule 27(e).

YACHT PROTEST

Also International Code flag “B,” is seen at sailing races and other events.

### Display of State Flags

Any citizen of any state may fly the flag of that state, unless doing so is specifically prohibited by state law. On a vessel with one or more masts, the state flag is flown at the main masthead in place of the private signal, officer’s flag, or USCG Auxiliary ensign (and in this case an Auxiliary officer cannot fly the officer’s pennant from the starboard spreader). When the state flag displaces a yacht club or USPS officer’s flag, the officer’s flag cannot be flown from any other hoist. On a mastless boat, the state flag can be flown at the bow staff in lieu of a club burgee, or it may replace any flag flown from a suitable radio antenna.

The flying of a state flag at the stern of a boat is not proper, nor is it proper to fly from this place of honor any Confederate, “pirate,” or other “gag” flag, and certainly not the flag of a foreign country of one’s heritage.

##### FLAG DISPLAY ASHORE

Flag displays at yacht clubs or similar shore installations. The officer’s flag is that of the senior officer present on the grounds or on board his boat in the club anchorage. Storm signals may be substituted for the International Code flags, which are displayed on national holidays or other days of special significance.

### Flag Display Ashore

The flagpole or mast of a yacht club is considered to represent the mast of a vessel, and the peak of the gaff, if one is used, is the place of honor from which the U.S. ensign is flown, just as it would be on a gaff-rigged boat. The location of the gaff on the pole is opposite to the direction to the water—as if it were on a ship standing out to sea. The flag should be hoisted briskly but lowered slowly and ceremoniously.

There has been some confusion because proper flag etiquette requires no other flag to be flown above the U.S. ensign, and obviously another flag, such as a yacht club burgee at the masthead, will be higher than the U.S. flag when the latter is at the gaff. This is entirely proper because “above,” in flag etiquette, means “directly on top of.” The illustrations in “Flag Display Ashore,” opposite, show the standard mast and pole displays as if you were ashore, facing seaward.

Note that signal flags should be flown from a conspicuous hoist; and that on national holidays and days of special yachting significance you may fly the flags of the International Code. Flags flown ashore at private homes may follow the code used for yacht clubs and similar organizations.

### Half-masting Flags

A flag is flown at half-mast (or half-staff) in respect for a deceased person. Although there are no laws governing the half-masting of flags on private vessels, or at private homes and clubs, most citizens follow the flag display customs used on U.S. government buildings and ships. The U.S. ensign should only be flown at half-mast by direction of the president or a governor of a state. The duration varies from a few days (usually until sunset on the day of burial) to 30 days, according to the deceased person’s position. It is not correct for a yacht club commodore or similar organization official to order the U.S. ensign half-masted—only the burgee or organization flag. On Memorial Day, the U.S. flag is flown at half-mast until 1200 (or if a 21-gun salute is fired starting at noon, until 1220, the time of the final shot).

On a simple flagstaff—as at a vessel’s stern or flagpole ashore—half-mast position is about three-fourths the way up to the top. If the flagpole has a yardarm, or yardarm and gaff, half-mast position is level with the yardarm. When the U.S. flag is displayed at half-mast on a vessel, other flags remain at their normal position. When it is half-masted ashore, fly only a private signal or club burgee at the masthead of a gaff-rigged mast with it.

When the U.S. ensign is flown at half-mast, it should be hoisted fully and smartly, then lowered ceremoniously to half-mast position. Before lowering, it is again raised to full height and lowered from there. Some yacht clubs fly their burgee at half-mast for a period of mourning on the death of a club member. A private signal may be flown at half-mast on the death of the vessel’s owner.

### Flag Display at Meetings

The flag of the United States should be displayed either from a staff or flat against the wall above and behind the speaker’s table or lectern.

The flag of the United States should never be draped or laid over anything except a casket, at which time special rules apply.

When displayed flat against a wall, it should be fastened by the upper edge only, with union to the flag’s right (to a viewer’s left). This is applicable whether the flag is hung with the stripes horizontal or vertical; a horizontal position of the stripes is preferable.

When displayed on a staff indoors, the U.S. national ensign is stood at the right of the speaker regardless of whether or not there is a platform or stage at the front of the room. A state or organizational flag, if displayed, is placed at the speaker’s left. (If the flag of another nation is displayed, it should be at the speaker’s right, just inboard of the U.S. flag.) If the flag of the United States and another flag are displayed with crossed staffs, as at the head of a room, the U.S. flag should be at its right and with its staff in front of the staff of the other flag.

If the flag of the United States is flown with other flags in a group, it should be in the center and slightly higher, or it should be in front of the other flags.

##### FLAG DISPLAY AFLOAT

Where the illustrations below specify “at the starboard spreader” it means the spreader that is on the most forward mast if there is more than one, and by the most outboard hoist on that spreader.

When referring to the illustration captions, note that conventions for a vessel “at anchor” also apply to other non-underway statuses—at a mooring or made fast to the shore.

On a powerboat with signal mast with spreaders, the U.S. or yacht ensign is flown from the stern staff, and the squadron pennant or club burgee is at the bow staff. The officer’s flag, private signal, or USCG Auxiliary ensign is at the masthead. An owner-absent or guest flag, or the USPS ensign (if not flown at the stern), is displayed at the starboard spreader.

When a gaff is added to the signal mast, it is the place for the U.S. or yacht ensign, while underway. At anchor, these are flown at the stern.

On a typical small powerboat with radio antenna, a USPS officer’s or past officer’s flag, or a USCG Auxiliary ensign may be flown from the antenna a the same height as if on a signal mast. Flags at the bow and stern are the same on a craft with signal mast with spreader.

On a small powerboat with a signal mast, flags are displayed in the same manner as for the craft with signal mast with spreaders (top left).

On a sportfishermen, the U.S., USPS, or yacht ensign is flown abaft the tuna tower to keep the cockpit coaming clear at the stern for fishing lines.

On a mastless motorboat the U.S. ensign (or if not in foreign waters, the USPS or yacht ensign) is flown from a stern staff and the club burgee, USPS squadron pennant, USCG Auxiliary ensign, or private signal is flown from the bow staff.

A documented two-masted motorboat with spreaders on each mast (above) at anchor. The U.S. or yacht ensign is at the stern staff, USPS or USCG Auxiliary ensign at the forward starboard spreader, club burgee or squadron burgee at the forward masthead, and private signal or officer’s flag at the after masthead. The Union Jack is at the bow (jack) staff; this is displayed only when the vessel is not underway.

On a yawl or ketch, the club burgee or squadron burgee is at the main masthead and the private signal or officer’s flag is at the mizzen masthead. At anchor or in port, the U.S. or yacht ensign is flown from the stern staff, and the USPS ensign at the starboard main spreader, if the boat is operated by a member. Underway, the ensign can be flown at the stern or from the leech of the aftermost sail or from the backstay at the height shown above.

A single-masted sailboat underway may fly the U.S., USPS, or yacht ensign at a stern staff (above, left) or at the leech of the mainsail approximately two-thirds the length of the leech above the clew (above, right). The club burgee, squadron burgee, private signal, or officer’s flag is at the masthead. If not flown from the stern or leech, the USPS ensign may be flown from the starboard spreader.

On a schooner underway (right), flag arrangement is the same as for a yawl or ketch, even though the relative height of the masts is reversed. The U.S. or yacht ensign may be flown from a stern staff while underway (not racing) if the length of the aftermost boom permits.

##### GUIDE TO MISCELLANEOUS FLAGS

• Diver Down There are two flags flown in connection with diving operations: a red flag with a single diagonal stripe of white, indicating divers in the water, or, as required by the Navigation Rules, the International Code Flag “A,” indicating the limited ability of the vessel to maneuver (see this page). It is not proper for them to be flown on shore or by any boat not engaged in diving operations.

• Race Committee or Regatta Committee Flag is a blue rectangular flag with a single vertical foul anchor in white with the letters “R” and “C” beside the anchor in white or red. It is often large, and may be flown at any position for greatest visibility. Often other flags are taken down to avoid confusion.

• Transportation or Tender Flag is used in many harbors where boats lie at moorings, and where yacht clubs or commercial operators provide launch (water taxi) service to and from the shore. This is the International Code flag “T”; it is used to request service and may be used with a sound signal; it may be flown by craft providing such service.

• Quarantine Flag, the International Code letter “Q” (plain yellow, rectangular), is flown when entering a foreign port (except Canada and a few others), or returning to a U.S. port from a foreign cruise. It signals that the vessel is “healthy” and requests clearance into the port; it is taken down after customs and immigration formalities have been completed.

• Protest Flag, the International Code flag “B” (plain red, swallow-tailed), is seen at sailing or other contests. It signals that the vessel flying it will file a protest on another vessel (or vessels) at the event’s conclusion.

• Man Overboard Flag is generally recognized as the International code flag for the letter “O” (red-and-yellow divided diagonally; rectangular); this flag is often fixed to a staff, which in turn is attached to a life ring.

• Union Jack is a rectangular blue flag with 50 stars (the equivalent of the upper-left quadrant of the national ensign). It may be flown only at the jack staff on sailing yachts or the jack staff of motor yachts with more than one mast, only during the day, and only while not underway on Sundays and national holidays, or when “dressing ship.” On modern craft, the normal bow staff is used as the “jack staff.” It should be the same size as the corresponding portion of the national flag being flown.

• Owner Absent & Guest Flags Some larger yachts will fly a rectangular plain blue flag when the owner is not on board. This is flown at the starboard main spreader; a blue light is shown at night.

When an owner is not present but guests are on board and in charge of the yacht, the flag flown is blue with a diagonal white stripe and is flown from the port main spreader.

# APPENDIX D

## THE METRIC SYSTEM

The Metric Conversion Act of 1975 (amended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988) declares, as the policy of the United States, that the metric system of measurement is the preferred system of weights and measures for U.S. trade and commerce. To date, little progress has been made in converting the everyday thinking of the general U.S. population, including boaters; most persons continue to use a system that is variously called “Customary,” “English,” or “Inch-Pound.” An understanding of the metric system, however, is becoming increasingly necessary as its use continues to expand—Navigation Rules, internal-combustion engines, liquor and wine, the nautical charts of other nations (and now some U.S. charts), etc.

The terms “metric system,” “SI,” “SI metric,” and “SI units” refer to units belonging to the International System of Units (abbreviated SI from the French Le Système International d’Unités). They include the SI units (together with their multiples and submultiples); three other metric units—the liter, hectare, and metric ton—that are accepted for use with the SI units because of their practical importance; and a small number of other metric units that are accepted because of their use in specialized fields. SI provides a logical and interrelated framework for measurements in science, industry, commerce, and other forms of human endeavor.

The modern metric system is based on a foundation of base units, with multiples and submultiples expressed in a decimal system using various prefixes.

### The SI Units

The base units of most interest to boaters are length, weight, and time. These units and their symbols are:

Length

meter (m)*

Mass (weight)

kilogram (kg)**

Time

second (s)***

Other base units of wide interest are temperature and electrical current:

Temperature

Kelvin (K)****

Electrical current

Ampere (A)

* The international spelling is “metre,” but for United States usage “meter” has been adopted (the pronunciation is the same).

** The kilogram is the only base unit that integrally includes a multiplier (see below).

*** Although the base SI unit for time is the second, units of minute, hour, and day are accepted for use with SI.

**** For nonscientific use, the degree Celsius (C) is more commonly used. The size of the units is the same; the difference is in the zero degree temperature. Degree “Celsius” was formerly known as “centigrade” (also symbol “C”).

The symbols, shown in parentheses, are not abbreviations. Most are written in lowercase letters except for those units (such as Ampere and degrees Celsius and Kelvin) that are named after a person. Unit symbols are not changed for the plural form. In the statement of a quantity, a space is inserted between the numerical value and the symbol; a hyphen is normally used in the adjectival form (exception: no space is used between values of degrees, minutes, and seconds and the symbols). Periods are not used with any symbols (except at the end of a sentence).

### Derived Units

Other units in the metric system are derived from the base units. Typical of those expressed in combinations of base units and of interest to boaters are:

Area

square meter (m2)

Volume

cubic meter (m3)

Speed, velocity

meter per second (m/s) kilometer per hour (km/h)

Frequency

Hertz (Hz) [cycles per second]

Energy, work

Joules (J)

Power

Watt (W) [Joules/s]

### Multiples & Submultiples

Units larger and smaller than the base units are formed by adding prefixes to make multiples and submultiples. The prefix symbol is added to the symbol for the base unit. Prefixes that are multiples or submultiples of 1,000 (kilo, centi, milli) are generally preferred as follows (there are others for larger and smaller multipliers, but such are of lesser interest):

* Note the exception to the capitalization and single-letter rules for “G,” “M,” and “da” to prevent confusion with “g,” “m,” and “d.”

### Retained Non-SI Units

Certain units that are not metric units are so widely used that they are accepted for use with the metric system.

#### Non-SI Units of Interest to Boaters

Of interest to boaters are degrees (°), minutes (′), and seconds (″) as measurements of arc. (The radian is the metric measurement of plane angles, but its use has been limited to scientific applications.)

#### Other Non-SI Units

There are other non-SI units, the use of which continues for a limited time subject to future review. These include the nautical mile and knots as measurements of distance and speed. Also retained are the “bar” and “millibar” for atmospheric pressure.

The “liter” as a unit of volume is widely used—it is equal to 0.001 m3 or 1,000 cm3. The international symbol for liter is the lowercase letter “l”; but because of the similarity of this character with the numeral “1,” the uppercase letter, “L,” is commonly used in the United States.

The “metric ton”(t), 1,000 kilograms, is not strictly a part of SI but is widely used.

### Conversion

Conversion factors are given below. These factors are rounded off for general use; in most cases these will yield quite acceptable practical results.

### Metric System Conversion Factors

#### Customary Units to Metric Units

#### Metric Units to Customary Units

When converting in either direction, care must be taken that multiplication does not result in a value implying a higher degree of precision (see Chapter 16, this page) than the value in the original system. Rounding should be applied to the converted value to yield the same number of significant digits (do not round either the original value or the conversion factor).

### Using the Internet

Conversions in either direction for any unit or value are quickly, easily, and accurately made by using one of the several available Web sites on the Internet, such as: www.unitconversion.org; www.digitaldutch.com/unitconverter.

antifouling A type of paint, used on the bottoms of boats, that repels barnacles, marine grass and many other undesirable adhesions.

apparent wind The direction and force of the wind relative to a moving vessel, differing from true wind. The motion of a sailboat or powerboat underway makes the effective wind, acting on sails or hull, vary from the actual wind. Apparent wind can be indicated by a telltale or instruments.

astern (1) The direction toward the stern of a vessel. (2) Beyond the stern.

athwart At right angles to the centerline.

auxiliary A sailboat that has an engine.

aweigh Off the bottom, said of an anchor.

backdrafting A potentially dangerous condition caused by air movement over or around a boat, creating a low-pressure area at the stern that can increase CO levels on board.

backsplice A splice in which the strands are reversed and interwoven, to make a neat end to a line.

backstay A stay supporting the mast, running from the masthead to the stern.

bar A sand, mud, or debris shoal, as across the mouth of a river or harbor.

beating Sailing against the wind, in alternate tacks.

Beaufort wind scale A scale indicating the force of the wind, invented by Admiral Beaufort in 1808; the original scale indicated the effect on a full-rigged frigate under sail; it has been extended to cover effects on shore as well as at sea, plus criteria that can now be measured, such as speed of the wind; the scale usually shows wind forces 0 through 12, but it has been expanded to 17. Each increase of force (number) means a doubling of the pressure (not velocity) of the wind.

becket (1) A loop or eye made in the end of rope or wire. (2) A rope handle.
