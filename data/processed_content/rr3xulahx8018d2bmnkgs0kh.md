Preface to the Sixth Edition

This new edition of 501 Spanish Verbs has been updated so that it is easier to
use than ever! All of the verb lists that you need are in the back pages of the
book with handy tabs so that you can find the list you need quickly and easily.
We hope that you will also take the time to practice your conjugations and gram-
mar with the new verb drills and tests with answers explained on CD-ROM. The
model verbs themselves have been revised and include extra material for certain
Essential Verbs. These are verbs that we believe will be helpful to students
because they represent an important conjugation group or because they are useful
in many everyday situations and idiomatic expressions. We have also taken into
account the many technological advances that have taken place over the past sev-
eral years, as well as the increased globalization and social change in the 21st
century. We hope that 501 Spanish Verbs will continue to provide the guidance
that students and travelers like you have come to expect over the years.

We have, therefore, added a number of related words and idiomatic expres-
sions, along with English meanings, at the bottom of every verb page from 97 to
648. We also hope that you will take advantage of the section on verb drills and
tests with answers explained, beginning on page 45. There, you will find a lot of
practice in Spanish verb forms and tenses in a variety of tests and word games to
determine your strengths and weaknesses yourself and to make some things
clearer in your mind. Also, it would be a good idea to get acquainted with the
section on definitions of basic grammatical terms. It’s on page 33. Many students
who study a foreign language have problems because they do not understand cer-
tain grammatical terms. If you know what they are, what they are called, and
how they are used in the grammatical structure of a sentence, you will improve
your skill in speaking and writing Spanish.

Don’t miss the expanded Spanish-English index at the end of the book. There

are now over 2,100 verbs—in addition to the 501 in the main listing. The
English-Spanish list, which begins on page 682, is a handy tool if you can’t
remember the Spanish verb you need to use.

Have you ever wondered what preposition goes with what verb? Many people
do. Check out page 669 for the section on verbs with prepositions. On page 666,
there is a simple system of sound transcriptions to help you pronounce Spanish
words effectively.

In this edition, we have put all the Defective and Impersonal Verbs in one con-
venient place, at the end of the main listing. This gave us room to give you more
fully conjugated verbs in the main list.

We hope that you will make full use of all the features of this new edition of
501 Spanish Verbs and that you will enjoy your exploration of Spanish language
and culture.

Introduction

This self-teaching book of 501 commonly used Spanish verbs for students and
travelers provides fingertip access to correct verb forms.

Verb conjugations are usually found scattered in Spanish grammar books and
they are difficult to find quickly when needed. Verbs have always been a major
problem for students no matter what system or approach the teacher uses. You
will master Spanish verb forms if you study this book for a few minutes every
day, especially the pages before and after the alphabetical listing of the 501 verbs.
This book will help make your work easier and at the same time will teach you
Spanish verb forms systematically. It is a useful book because it provides a quick
and easy way to find the full conjugation of many Spanish verbs.

The 501 verbs included here are arranged alphabetically by infinitive at the top

of each page. The book contains many common verbs of high frequency, both
reflexive and nonreflexive, which you need to know. It also contains many other
frequently used verbs which are irregular in some way. Beginning on page 707,
there are over 2,100 Spanish verbs that can be conjugated in the same way as
model verbs among the 501. If the verb you have in mind is not given among the
501, consult this list.

The subject pronouns have been omitted from the conjugations in order to
emphasize the verb forms. The subject pronouns are given on page 92. Turn to
that page now and become acquainted with them.

The first thing to do when you use this book is to become familiar with it from
cover to cover—in particular, the front and back pages, where you will find valu-
able and useful information to make your work easier and more enjoyable. Take a
minute right now and turn to the table of contents at the beginning of this book as
we guide you in the following way:

(a) Beginning on page 3, you can learn how to form a present participle regu-
larly in Spanish with examples. There, you will find the common irregular pres-
ent participles and the many uses of the present participle.

(b) Beginning on page 5, you can learn how to form a past participle regularly
in Spanish with examples. There, you will find the common irregular past partici-
ples and the many uses of the past participle.

(c) On page 7, the Passive and Active voices are explained with numerous

examples.

(d) Beginning on page 9, you will find the principal parts of some important
Spanish verbs. This is useful because, if you know these, you are well on your
way to mastering Spanish verb forms.

(e) Beginning on page 11, we give you a sample English verb conjugation so

that you can get an idea of the way a verb is expressed in the English tenses.
Many people do not know one tense from another because they have never
learned the use of verb tenses in a systematic and organized way—not even in
English! How can you, for example, know that you need the conditional form of
a verb in Spanish when you want to say “I would go to the movies if . . .” or the
pluperfect tense in Spanish if you want to say “I had gone . . . .”? The sample
English verb conjugation with the names of the tenses and their numerical rank-

1

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 2

ing will help you to distinguish one tense from another so that you will know
what tense you need in order to express a verb in Spanish.

(f) On page 13, you will find a summary of meanings and uses of Spanish verb
tenses and moods as related to English verb tenses and moods. That section is very
important and useful because the seven simple tenses are separated from the seven
compound tenses. You are given the name of each tense in Spanish and English
starting with the present indicative, which we call tense number one because it is
the tense most frequently used. We assign a number to each tense name so that
you can fix each one in your mind and associate the tense names and numbers in
their logical order. We explain briefly what each tense is, when you use it, and we
give examples using verbs in sentences in Spanish and English. At the end of each
tense, you are shown how to form that tense for regular verbs.

(g) Beginning on page 27, we explain the Imperative, which is a mood, not a

tense, and give numerous examples using it.

(h) Beginning on page 4, the progressive forms of tenses are explained with
examples. Also note the future subjunctive and the future perfect subjunctive on
page 30. We explain how these two rarely used tenses are formed, and we give
examples of what tenses are used in place of them in informal writing and in con-
versation.

(i) Beginning on page 14, we give you a summary of all of the fourteen tenses
in Spanish with English equivalents, which we have divided into the seven simple
tenses and the seven compound tenses. After referring to that summary frequent-
ly, you will soon know that tense number 1 is the present indicative, tense num-
ber 2 is the imperfect indicative, and so on. We also explain how each compound
tense is based on each simple tense. Try to see these two divisions as two frames,
two pictures, with the seven simple tenses in one frame and the seven compound
tenses in another frame. Place them side by side in your mind, and you will see
how tense number 8 is related to tense number 1, tense number 9 to tense number
2, and so on. If you study the numerical arrangement of each of the seven simple
tenses and associate the tense number with the tense name, you will find it very
easy to learn the names of the seven compound tenses, how they rank numerical-
ly according to use, how they are formed, and when they are used. Spend at least
ten minutes every day studying these preliminary pages to help you better under-
stand the fourteen tenses in Spanish.

Finally, in the back pages of this book, there are useful indexes: an index of
English-Spanish verbs, an index of common irregular Spanish verb forms identi-
fied by infinitive, and a list of over 2,100 Spanish verbs that are conjugated like
model verbs among the 501.

Note that each verb is listed in the Alphabetical Listing of 501 Spanish Verbs is

followed by a number in parentheses. This number is the verb number for the
purpose of easy cross-referencing in this book. If you refer to the many features
of this book each time you look up verb tense forms for a particular verb, you
will increase your knowledge of Spanish vocabulary and Spanish idioms by leaps
and bounds.

We sincerely hope that this new edition of 501 Spanish Verbs will be of great

help to you in learning and using Spanish verbs.

Formation of the Present and Past
Participles in Spanish

Formation of the present participle in Spanish

A present participle is a verb form which, in English, ends in -ing; for example,
singing, eating, receiving. In Spanish, a present participle is regularly formed as
follows:
drop the ar of an -ar ending verb, like cantar, and add ando: cantando/singing
drop the er of an -er ending verb, like comer, and add iendo: comiendo/eating
drop the ir of an -ir ending verb, like recibir, and add iendo: recibiendo/receiving

In English, a gerund also ends in -ing, but there is a distinct difference in use
between a gerund and a present participle in English. In brief, it is this: in English,
when a present participle is used as a noun it is called a gerund; for example,
Reading is good. As a present participle in English, it would be used as follows:
While reading, the boy fell asleep.

In the first example (Reading is good), reading is a gerund because it is the sub-
ject of the verb is. In Spanish, however, we do not use the present participle form as
a noun to serve as a subject; we use the infinitive form of the verb: Leer es bueno.

Uses of the present participle

1. To form the progressive tenses: The Progressive Present is formed by using
estar in the present tense plus the present participle of the main verb you are
using. The Progressive Past is formed by using estar in the imperfect indica-
tive plus the present participle of the main verb you are using. (See below and
on page 5 for a complete description of the uses and formation of the progres-
sive tenses with examples.)

2. To express vividly an action that occurred (preterit + present participle):

El niño entró llorando en la casa/ The little boy came into the house crying.

3. To express the English use of by + present participle in Spanish, we use the
gerund form, which has the same ending as a present participle explained
above: Trabajando, se gana dinero/By working, one earns (a person earns)
money; Estudiando mucho, Pepe recibió buenas notas/By studying hard, Joe
received good grades.

Note that no preposition is used in front of the present participle (the Spanish
gerund) even though it is expressed in English as by + present participle.

Note, too, that in Spanish we use al + inf. (not + present part.) to express on or
upon + present part. in English: Al entrar en la casa, el niño comenzó a llorar/
Upon entering the house, the little boy began to cry.

4. To form the Perfect Participle: habiendo hablado/having talked.

The Progressive forms of tenses

(1) In Spanish, there are progressive forms of tenses. They are the Progressive

Present and the Progressive Past.

(2) The Progressive Present is formed by using estar in the present tense plus
the present participle of your main verb; e.g., Estoy hablando/I am talking,
i.e., I am (in the act of) talking (right now). Here is how you would form the
progressive present of hablar (to talk) using estar in the present tense plus
the present participle of hablar:

estoy hablando
estás hablando
está hablando

estamos hablando
estáis hablando
están hablando

4

The Progressive forms of tenses

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 5

(3) The Progressive Past is formed by using estar in the imperfect indicative
plus the present participle of your main verb; e.g., Estaba hablando/I was
talking, i.e., I was (in the act of) talking (right then). Here is how you would
form the progressive past of hablar (to talk) using estar in the imperfect
indicative plus the present participle of hablar:

estaba hablando
estabas hablando
estaba hablando

estábamos hablando
estabais hablando
estaban hablando

(4) The progressive forms are generally used when you want to emphasize or

intensify an action; if you don’t want to do that, then simply use the present
or imperfect; e.g., say Hablo, not Estoy hablando; or Hablaba, not Estaba
hablando.

(5) Sometimes ir is used instead of estar to form the progressive tenses; e.g., Va
hablando/He (she) keeps right on talking, Iba hablando/He (she) kept right
on talking. Note that they do not have the exact same meaning as Está
hablando and Estaba hablando. See (2) and (3) above.

(6) Also, at times andar, continuar, seguir, and venir are used as helping verbs in

the present or imperfect indicative tenses plus the present participle to
express the progressive forms: Los muchachos andaban cantando/The boys
were walking along singing; La maestra seguía leyendo a la clase/The
teacher kept right on reading to the class.

Formation of the past participle in Spanish

A past participle is a verb form which, in English, usually ends in -ed: for exam-
ple, worked, talked, arrived, as in I have worked, I have talked, I have arrived.
There are many irregular past participles in English; for example, gone, sung, as
in She has gone, We have sung. In Spanish, a past participle is regularly formed
as follows:

drop the ar of an -ar ending verb, like cantar, and add ado: cantado/sung
drop the er of an -er ending verb, like comer, and add ido: comido/eaten
drop the ir of an -ir ending verb, like recibir, and add ido: recibido/received

Uses of the past participle

1. To form the seven compound tenses

2. To form the Perfect Infinitive: haber hablado/to have spoken.

3. To form the Perfect Participle: habiendo hablado/having spoken.

4. To serve as an adjective, which must agree in gender and number with the

noun it modifies: El señor Molina es muy respetado por todos los alumnos/
Mr. Molina is very respected by all the students; La señora González es muy
conocida/Mrs. González is very well known.

5. To express the result of an action with estar and sometimes with quedar or

quedarse: La puerta está abierta/The door is open; Las cartas están
escritas/The letters are written; Los niños se quedaron asustados/The children
remained frightened.

6. To express the passive voice with ser: La ventana fue abierta por el ladrón/

The window was opened by the robber.

6 Uses of the past participle

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 7

Passive Voice and Active Voice

Passive voice means that the action of the verb falls on the subject; in other
words, the subject receives the action: La ventana fue abierta por el ladrón/The
window was opened by the robber. Note that abierta (really a form of the past
part. abrir/abierto) is used as an adjective and it must agree in gender and num-
ber with the subject that it describes.

Active voice means that the subject performs the action and the subject is always
stated: El ladrón abrió la ventana/The robber opened the window.

To form the true passive, use ser + the past part. of the verb you have in mind;
the past part. then serves as an adjective and it must agree in gender and number
with the subject that it describes. In the true passive, the agent (the doer) is
always expressed with the prep. por in front of it. The formula for the true pas-
sive construction is: subject + tense of ser + past part. + por + the agent (the
doer): Estas composiciones fueron escritas por Juan/These compositions were
written by John.

The reflexive pronoun se may be used to substitute for the true passive voice con-
struction. When you use the se construction, the subject is a thing (not a person)
and the doer (agent) is not stated: Aquí se habla español/Spanish is spoken here;
Aquí se hablan español e inglés/Spanish and English are spoken here; Se venden
libros en esta tienda/Books are sold in this store.

There are a few standard idiomatic expressions that are commonly used with the
pronoun se. These expressions are not truly passive, the pronoun se is not truly a
reflexive pronoun, and the verb form is in the 3rd pers. sing. only. In this con-
struction, there is no subject expressed; the subject is contained in the use of se +
the 3rd pers. sing. of the verb at all times and the common translations into
English are: it is . . . , people . . . , they . . . , one . . .

Se cree que . . . It is believed that . . . , people believe that . . . , they believe
that . . . , one believes that . . .

Se cree que este criminal es culpable. It is believed that this criminal is guilty.

Se dice que . . . It is said that . . . , people say that . . . , they say that . . . , one
says that . . . , you say . . .

Se dice que va a nevar esta noche. They say that it’s going to snow tonight.
¿Cómo se dice en español “ice cream”? How do you say ice cream in Spanish?

Se sabe que . . . It is known that . . . , people know that . . . , they know that . . . ,
one knows that . . .

Se sabe que María va a casarse con Juan./People know that Mary is going to
marry John.

The se reflexive pronoun construction is avoided if the subject is a person
because there can be ambiguity in meaning. For example, how would you trans-
late the following into English? Se da un regalo. Which of the following two
meanings is intended? She (he) is being given a present, or She (he) is giving a
present to himself (to herself). In correct Spanish, you would have to say: Le da

Passive Voice and Active Voice

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 8

(a María, a Juan, etc.) un regalo/He (she) is giving a present to Mary (to John,
etc.). Avoid using the se construction in the passive when the subject is a person;
change your sentence around and state it in the active voice to make the meaning
clear. Otherwise, the pronoun se seems to go with the verb, as if the verb is
reflexive, which gives an entirely different meaning. Another example: Se miró
would mean He (she) looked at himself (herself), not He (she) was looked at! If
you mean to say He (she) looked at her, say: La miró or, if in the plural, say: La
miraron/They looked at her.

The Spanish Infinitive and Its Principal Uses

An infinitive is a verb that is not inflected; in other words, it does not change in
form by inflection. In grammar, inflection takes place when a verb changes in
form according to whether the subject of the sentence is singular in the 1st (yo),
2nd (tú), or 3rd (Ud., él, ella) person, or plural (nosotros, etc.), and according to
the conjugated form of the verb in a particular tense, such as the present, preterit,
imperfect, future, etc. An infinitive is generally considered to be a mood and it
does not refer to a particular person, number, or tense. It is indeterminate and
general. It is not conjugated in the tenses. The verb, however, is inflected because
it is conjugated in the various tenses and changes in form. An infinitive remains
in the same form: hablar, comer, vivir. In English, an infinitive is recognized by
the preposition to in front of it, as in to speak, to eat, to live. When conjugated, to
speak changes to he, she speaks, I spoke, we have spoken, etc. The change in the
verb form is called inflection. The form of an infinitive is always the same
because it is not conjugated and it is not inflected.

Here are three principal uses of the Spanish infinitive. For more examples in
Spanish and English, please turn to page 669 where you will find an outline of
what preposition (if any) goes with what verb plus an infinitive.

1. An infinitive can be used as a noun and it is masculine in gender. In English
we use the present participle of a verb to function as a noun, in which case,
we call it a gerund. In Spanish, however, the infinitive form of a verb is
used. Examples:

Leer es bueno/El leer es bueno/Reading is good.
Fumar no es bueno para la salud/Smoking is not good for one’s health.

2. An infinitive is used with some finite verbs (those that are conjugated in the

various tenses) when affirmation or belief is conveyed. Examples:

María siempre cree tener razón/Mary always believes she is right.
Nosotros podemos venir a tu casa esta noche/We can come to your
house tonight (this evening).

3. An infinitive can be used with idiomatic expressions that contain que or de.

Examples:

Tengo mucho que hacer esta mañana/I have a lot to do this morning.
Mis amigos acaban de llegar/My friends have just arrived.

A Summary of Meanings and Uses of Spanish Verb Tenses
and Moods as Related to English Verb Tenses and Moods

A verb is where the action is! A verb is a word that expresses an action (like go,
eat, write) or a state of being (like think, believe, be). Tense means time. Spanish
and English verb tenses are divided into three main groups of time: past, present,
and future. A verb tense shows if an action or state of being took place, is taking
place, or will take place.

Spanish and English verbs are also used in moods, or modes. Mood has to do
with the way a person regards an action or a state of being that he expresses. For
example, a person may merely make a statement or ask a question—this is the
Indicative Mood, which we use most of the time in Spanish and English. A person
may say that he would do something if something else were possible or that he
would have done something if something else had been possible—this is the
Conditional. A person may use a verb in such a way that he indicates a wish, a
fear, a regret, a joy, a request, a supposition, or something of this sort—this is the
Subjunctive Mood. The Subjunctive Mood is used in Spanish much more than in
English. Finally, a person may command someone to do something or demand that
something be done—this is the Imperative Mood. English Conditional is not a
mood. (There is also the Infinitive Mood, but we are not concerned with that here.)

There are six tenses in English: Present, Past, Future, Present Perfect, Past

Perfect, and Future Perfect. The first three are simple tenses. The other three are
compound tenses and are based on the simple tenses. In Spanish, however, there
are fourteen tenses, seven of which are simple and seven of which are compound.
The seven compound tenses are based on the seven simple tenses. In Spanish and
English, a verb tense is simple if it consists of one verb form, e.g., estudio. A verb
tense is compound if it consists of two parts—the auxiliary (or helping) verb plus
the past participle, e.g., he estudiado. See the Summary of verb tenses and moods
in Spanish with English equivalents on page 31. We have numbered each tense
name for easy reference and recognition.

In Spanish, there is also another tense which is used to express an action in the
present. It is called the Progressive Present. It is used only if an action is actually
in progress at the time; for example, Estoy leyendo/I am reading (right now). It is
formed by using the Present Indicative of estar plus the present participle of the
verb. There is still another tense in Spanish which is used to express an action that
was taking place in the past. It is called the Progressive Past. It is used if an action
was actually in progress at a certain moment in the past; for example, Estaba
leyendo cuando mi hermano entró/I was reading when my brother came in. The
Progressive Past is formed by using the Imperfect Indicative of estar plus the pres-
ent participle of the verb. See pages 4 and 5 for more on the Progressive forms.

In the pages that follow, the tenses and moods are given in Spanish and the equiv-

alent name or names in English are given in parentheses. Although some of the
names given in English are not considered to be tenses (there are only six), they are
given for the purpose of identification as they are related to the Spanish names. The
comparison includes only the essential points you need to know about the meanings
and uses of Spanish verb tenses and moods as related to English usage. We shall
use examples to illustrate their meanings and uses. This is not intended to be a
detailed treatise. It is merely a summary. We hope you find it helpful.

THE SEVEN SIMPLE TENSES

Tense No. 1 Presente de Indicativo

(Present Indicative)

This tense is used most of the time in Spanish and English. It indicates:

(a) An action or a state of being at the present time.

EXAMPLES:
1. Hablo español. I speak Spanish.

I am speaking Spanish.
I do speak Spanish.

2. Creo en Dios. I believe in God.

(b) Habitual action.
EXAMPLE:
Voy a la biblioteca todos los días.
I go to the library every day.
I do go to the library every day.

(c) A general truth, something which is permanently true.

EXAMPLES:
1. Seis menos dos son cuatro.
Six minus two are four.

2. El ejercicio hace maestro al novicio.

Practice makes perfect.

(d) Vividness when talking or writing about past events.

EXAMPLE:
El asesino se pone pálido. Tiene miedo. Sale de la casa y corre a lo largo del río.
The murderer turns pale. He is afraid. He goes out of the house and runs along the
river.

(e) A near future.
EXAMPLES:
1. Mi hermano llega mañana.

My brother arrives tomorrow.
2. ¿Escuchamos un disco ahora?

Shall we listen to a record now?

(f) An action or state of being that occurred in the past and continues up to the present.

In Spanish, this is an idiomatic use of the present tense of a verb with hace, which
is also in the present.
EXAMPLE:
Hace tres horas que miro la televisión.
I have been watching television for three hours.

(g) The meaning of almost or nearly when used with por poco.

EXAMPLE:
Por poco me matan.
They almost killed me.

14

The Seven Simple Tenses

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 15

This tense is regularly formed as follows:

Drop the -ar ending of an infinitive, like hablar, and add the following endings: o, as, a;
amos, áis, an.
You then get:

hablo, hablas, habla;
hablamos, habláis, hablan

Drop the -er ending of an infinitive, like beber, and add the following endings: o, es, e;
emos, éis, en.
You then get:

bebo, bebes, bebe;
bebemos, bebéis, beben

Drop the -ir ending of an infinitive, like recibir, and add the following endings: o, es, e;
imos, ís, en.
You then get:

recibo, recibes, recibe;
recibimos, recibís, reciben

Tense No. 2 Imperfecto de Indicativo

(Imperfect Indicative)

This is a past tense. Imperfect suggests incomplete. The imperfect tense expresses an
action or a state of being that was continuous in the past and its completion is not
indicated. This tense is used, therefore, to express:

(a) An action that was going on in the past at the same time as another action.

EXAMPLE:
Mi hermano leía y mi padre hablaba.
My brother was reading and my father was talking.

(b) An action that was going on in the past when another action occurred.

EXAMPLE:
Mi hermana cantaba cuando yo entré.
My sister was singing when I came in.

(c) A habitual action in the past.

EXAMPLE:
1. Cuando estábamos en Nueva York, íbamos al cine todos los sábados.
When we were in New York, we went to the movies every Saturday.
When we were in New York, we used to go to the movies every Saturday.

2. Cuando vivíamos en California, íbamos a la playa todos los días.

When we used to live in California, we would go to the beach every day.

NOTE: In this last example, we would go looks like the conditional, but it is not. It is
the imperfect tense in this sentence because habitual action in the past is expressed.

(d) A description of a mental, emotional, or physical condition in the past.

EXAMPLES:
1. (mental condition) Quería ir al cine.

I wanted to go to the movies.

Common verbs in this use are creer, desear, pensar, poder, preferir, querer,
saber, sentir.

2. (emotional condition) Estaba contento de verlo.

I was happy to see him.

3. (physical condition) Mi madre era hermosa cuando era pequeña.

My mother was beautiful when she was young.

The Seven Simple Tenses

15

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 16

(e) The time of day in the past.

EXAMPLES:
1. ¿Qué hora era?

What time was it?

2. Eran las tres.

It was three o’clock.

(f) An action or state of being that occurred in the past and lasted for a certain length

of time prior to another past action. In English it is usually translated as a pluper-
fect tense and is formed with had been plus the present participle of the verb you
are using. It is like the special use of the presente de indicativo explained in the
above section in paragraph (f), except that the action or state of being no longer
exists at present. This is an idiomatic use of the imperfect tense of a verb with
hacía, which is also in the imperfect.
EXAMPLE:
Hacía tres horas que miraba la televisión cuando mi hermano entró.
I had been watching television for three hours when my brother came in.

(g) An indirect quotation in the past.

EXAMPLE:
Present:

Past:

Dice que quiere venir a mi casa.
He says he wants to come to my house.
Dijo que quería venir a mi casa.
He said he wanted to come to my house.

This tense is regularly formed as follows:

Drop the -ar ending of an infinitive, like hablar, and add the following endings: aba,
abas, aba; ábamos, abais, aban.
You then get:

hablaba, hablabas, hablaba;
hablábamos, hablabais, hablaban

The usual equivalent in English is: I was talking OR I used to talk OR I talked; you were
talking OR you used to talk OR you talked, etc.

Drop the -er ending of an infinitive, like beber, or the -ir ending of an infinitive, like
recibir, and add the following endings: ía, ías, ía; íamos, íais, ían.
You then get:

bebía, bebías, bebía;
bebíamos, bebíais, bebían
recibía, recibías, recibía;
recibíamos, recibíais, recibían

The usual equivalent in English is: I was drinking OR I used to drink OR I drank; you
were drinking OR you used to drink OR you drank, etc.; I was receiving OR I used to
receive OR I received; you were receiving OR you used to receive OR you received, etc.

Verbs irregular in the imperfect indicative:

ir/to go

ser/to be

ver/to see

iba, ibas, iba; (I was going, I used to go, etc.)

In Spanish, some verbs that express a mental state have a different meaning when used in
the preterit.

EXAMPLES:
1. La conocí la semana pasada en el baile.

I met her last week at the dance.
(Conocer, which means to know or be acquainted with, means met, that is,
introduced to for the first time, in the preterit.)

2. Pude hacerlo.

I succeeded in doing it.
(Poder, which means to be able, means succeeded in the preterit.)

3. No pude hacerlo.

(Poder, when used in the negative in the preterit, means failed or did not succeed.)

4. Quise llamarle.

I tried to call you.
(Querer, which means to wish or want, means tried in the preterit.)

The usual equivalent in English is: I drank OR I did drink; you drank OR you did drink,

In Spanish and English, the future tense is used to express an action or a state of being
that will take place at some time in the future.

EXAMPLES:
1. Lo haré.

I shall do it.

Note that these Future endings happen to be the endings of haber in the present indica-
tive: he, has, ha; hemos, habéis, han. Also note the accent marks on the Future endings,
except for emos.

You then get:

hablaré, hablarás, hablará;
hablaremos, hablaréis, hablarán
beberé, beberás, beberá;
beberemos, beberéis, beberán
recibiré, recibirás, recibirá;
recibiremos, recibiréis, recibirán

4. No cierren Uds. la puerta. Don’t close the door.
5. Dígame Ud. la verdad. Tell me the truth.

(b) To express a negative command in the familiar form (tú).

EXAMPLES:
1. No te sientes. Don’t sit down.
2. No entres. Don’t come in.

3. No duermas. Don’t sleep.
4. No lo hagas. Don’t do it.

(c) To express a negative command in the second person plural (vosotros).

EXAMPLES:
1. No os sentéis. Don’t sit down.
2. No entréis. Don’t come in.

3. No durmáis. Don’t sleep.
4. No lo hagáis. Don’t do it.

(d) To express a command in the first person plural, either in the affirmative or

negative (nosotros).
EXAMPLES:
1. Sentémonos. Let’s sit down.
2. No entremos. Let’s not go in.

See also Imperativo (Imperative) farther on.

(e) After a verb that expresses some kind of wish, insistence, preference, suggestion,

or request.
EXAMPLES:
1. Quiero que María lo haga.

I want Mary to do it.
NOTE:
In this example, English uses the infinitive form, to do. In Spanish,
however, a new clause is needed introduced by que because there is a new
subject, María. The present subjunctive of hacer is used (haga) because the
main verb is Quiero, which indicates a wish. If there were no change in subject,
Spanish would use the infinitive form, as we do in English, for example,
Quiero hacerlo/I want to do it.

2. Insisto en que María lo haga.

I insist that Mary do it.
3. Prefiero que María lo haga.
I prefer that Mary do it.
4. Pido que María lo haga.
I ask that Mary do it.

In examples 2, 3, and 4 here, English also uses the subjunctive form do.

NOTE:
Not so in example no. 1, however.

(f) After a verb that expresses doubt, fear, joy, hope, sorrow, or some other emotion.

Notice in the following examples, however, that the subjunctive is not used in English.
EXAMPLES:
1. Dudo que María lo haga.

I doubt that Mary is doing it.
I doubt that Mary will do it.

2. No creo que María venga.

I don’t believe (I doubt) that Mary is coming.
I don’t believe (I doubt) that Mary will come.

3. Temo que María esté enferma.

I fear that Mary is ill.

4. Me alegro de que venga María.
I’m glad that Mary is coming.
I’m glad that Mary will come.

5. Espero que María no esté enferma.

I hope that Mary is not ill.

(g) After certain impersonal expressions that show necessity, doubt, regret, impor-

tance, urgency, or possibility. Notice, however, that the subjunctive is not used in
English in some of the following examples.
EXAMPLES:
1. Es necesario que María lo haga.
It is necessary for Mary to do it.
It is necessary that Mary do it.
2. No es cierto que María venga.

It is doubtful (not certain) that Mary is coming.
It is doubtful (not certain) that Mary will come.

3. Es lástima que María no venga.

It’s too bad (a pity) that Mary isn’t coming.

4. Es importante que María venga.
It is important for Mary to come.
It is important that Mary come.

5. Es preciso que María venga.

It is necessary for Mary to come.
It is necessary that Mary come.

6. Es urgente que María venga.
It is urgent for Mary to come.
It is urgent that Mary come.

(h) After certain conjunctions of time, such as, antes (de) que, cuando, en cuanto,

después (de) que, hasta que, mientras, and the like. The subjunctive form of the
verb is used when introduced by any of these time conjunctions if the time
referred to is either indefinite or is expected to take place in the future. However,
if the action was completed in the past, the indicative mood is used.

The Seven Simple Tenses

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 22

EXAMPLES:
1. Le hablaré a María cuando venga.

I shall talk to Mary when she comes.

2. Vámonos antes (de) que llueva.

Let’s go before it rains.

3. En cuanto la vea yo, le hablaré.

As soon as I see her, I shall talk to her.

4. Me quedo aquí hasta que vuelva.
I’m staying here until he returns.

NOTE:

In the above examples, the subjunctive is not used in English.

(i) After certain conjunctions that express a condition, negation, purpose, such as a
menos que, con tal que, para que, a fin de que, sin que, en caso (de) que, and
the like. Notice, however, that the subjunctive is not used in English in the follow-
ing examples.
EXAMPLES:
1. Démelo con tal que sea bueno.

Give it to me provided that it is good.

2. Me voy a menos que venga.
I’m leaving unless he comes.

(j) After certain adverbs, such as acaso, quizá, and tal vez.

EXAMPLE:
Acaso venga mañana.
Perhaps he will come tomorrow.
Perhaps he is coming tomorrow.

(k) After aunque if the action has not yet occurred.

EXAMPLE:
Aunque María venga esta noche, no me quedo.
Although Mary may come tonight, I’m not staying.
Although Mary is coming tonight, I’m not staying.

(l)

In an adjectival clause if the antecedent is something or someone that is indefinite,
negative, vague, or nonexistent.
EXAMPLES:
1. Busco un libro que sea interesante.

In this example, que (which is the relative pronoun) refers to un libro

I’m looking for a book that is interesting.
NOTE:
(which is the antecedent). Since un libro is indefinite, the verb in the following
clause must be in the subjunctive (sea). Notice, however, that the subjunctive is
not used in English.

2. ¿Hay alguien aquí que hable francés?

In this example, que (which is the relative pronoun) refers to alguien (which

Is there anyone here who speaks French?
NOTE:
is the antecedent). Since alguien is indefinite and somewhat vague—we do not
know who this anyone might be—the verb in the following clause must be in the
subjunctive (hable). Notice, however, that the subjunctive is not used in English.

3. No hay nadie que pueda hacerlo.
There is no one who can do it.
NOTE:
(which is the antecedent). Since nadie is nonexistent, the verb in the following
clause must be in the subjunctive (pueda). Notice, however, that the subjunctive
is not used in English.

In this example, que (which is the relative pronoun) refers to nadie

22

The Seven Simple Tenses

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 23

(m) After por más que or por mucho que.

EXAMPLES:
1. Por más que hable usted, no quiero escuchar.

No matter how much you talk, I don’t want to listen.

2. Por mucho que se alegre, no me importa.
No matter how glad he is, I don’t care.

(n) After the expression ojalá (que), which expresses a great desire. This interjection
means would to God! or may God grant! . . . It is derived from the Arabic, ya
Allah! (Oh, God!)
EXAMPLE:
¡Ojalá que vengan mañana!
Would to God that they come tomorrow!
May God grant that they come tomorrow!
How I wish that they would come tomorrow!
If only they would come tomorrow!

Finally, remember that the present subjunctive is never used in Spanish after si when si
means if.
The present subjunctive of regular verbs and many irregular verbs is normally
formed as follows:
Go to the present indicative, 1st pers. sing., of the verb you have in mind, drop the ending
o, and

for an -ar ending type, add: e, es, e; emos, éis, en
for an -er or -ir ending type, add: a, as, a; amos, áis, an

As you can see, the characteristic vowel in the present subjunctive endings for an -ar type
verb is e in the six persons.
As you can see, the characteristic vowel in the present subjunctive endings for an -er or
-ir type verb is a in the six persons.
Since the present subjunctive of some irregular verbs is not normally formed as stated
above (e.g., dar, dormir, haber, ir, secar, sentir, ser, tocar), you must look up the verb
you have in mind in the alphabetical listing in this book.

Tense No. 7 Imperfecto de Subjuntivo

(Imperfect Subjunctive)

This past tense is used for the same reasons as the presente de subjuntivo—that is, after cer-
tain verbs, conjunctions, impersonal expressions, etc., which were explained and illustrated
above in tense no. 6. The main difference between these two tenses is the time of the action.

If the verb in the main clause is in the present indicative or future or present perfect
indicative or imperative, the present subjunctive or the present perfect subjunctive is used
in the dependent clause—provided, of course, that there is some element which requires
the use of the subjunctive.

However, if the verb in the main clause is in the imperfect indicative, preterit, condition-
al, or pluperfect indicative, the imperfect subjunctive (this tense) or pluperfect subjunctive
is ordinarily used in the dependent clause—provided, of course, that there is some element
which requires the use of the subjunctive.

EXAMPLES:
1. Insistí en que María lo hiciera.

I insisted that Mary do it.

2. Se lo explicaba a María para que lo comprendiera.

I was explaining it to Mary so that she might understand it.

The Seven Simple Tenses

23

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 24

Note that the imperfect subjunctive is used after como si to express a condition contrary

to fact.

EXAMPLE:
Me habla como si fuera un niño.
He speaks to me as if I were a child.
NOTE: In this last example, the subjunctive is used in English also for the same
reason.

Finally, note that quisiera (the imperfect subjunctive of querer) can be used to express
politely a wish or desire, as in I should like: Quisiera hablar ahora/I should like to
speak now.

The imperfect subjunctive is regularly formed as follows:

For all verbs, drop the ron ending of the 3rd pers. pl. of the preterit and add the following
endings:

ra, ras, ra;
ramos, rais, ran

OR

se, ses, se;
semos, seis, sen

The only accent mark on the forms of the imperfect subjunctive is on the 1st pers. pl.
form (nosotros) and it is placed on the vowel which is right in front of the ending ramos
or semos.

THE SEVEN COMPOUND TENSES

Tense No. 8 Perfecto de Indicativo

(Present Perfect Indicative)

This is the first of the seven compound tenses that follow here. This tense expresses an
action that took place at no definite time in the past. It is also called the past indefinite. It is
a compound tense because it is formed with the present indicative of haber (the auxiliary or
helping verb) plus the past participle of your main verb. Note the translation into English in
the examples that follow. Then compare this tense with the perfecto de subjuntivo, which
is tense no. 13. For the seven simple tenses of haber (which you need to know to form
these seven compound tenses), see haber listed alphabetically among the 501 verbs in this
book.

EXAMPLES:
1. (Yo) he hablado.
I have spoken.

2. (Tú) no has venido a verme.
You have not come to see me.

3. Elena ha ganado el premio.
Helen has won the prize.

Tense No. 9 Pluscuamperfecto de Indicativo

(Pluperfect or Past Perfect Indicative)

This is the second of the compound tenses. In Spanish and English, this past tense is used to
express an action which happened in the past before another past action. Since it is used in
relation to another past action, the other past action is ordinarily expressed in the preterit.
However, it is not always necessary to have the other past action expressed, as in example 2
on the following page.

24

The Seven Compound Tenses

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 25

In English, this tense is formed with the past tense of to have (had) plus the past partici-

ple of your main verb. In Spanish, this tense is formed with the imperfect indicative of
haber plus the past participle of the verb you have in mind. Note the translation into
English in the examples that follow. Then compare this tense with the pluscuamperfecto
de subjuntivo, which is tense no. 14. For the seven simples tenses of haber (which you
need to know to form these seven compound tenses), see haber listed alphabetically
among the 501 verbs in this book.

EXAMPLES:
1. Cuando llegué a casa, mi hermano había salido.
When I arrived home, my brother had gone out.
NOTE: First, my brother went out; then, I arrived home. Both actions happened
in the past. The action that occurred in the past before the other past action is in
the pluperfect, and, in this example, it is my brother had gone out (mi hermano
había salido).
NOTE also that llegué (I arrived) is in the preterit because it is an action that
happened in the past and it was completed.

2. Juan lo había perdido en la calle.

In this example, the pluperfect indicative is used even though no other

John had lost it in the street.
NOTE:
past action is expressed. It is assumed that John had lost something before some
other past action.

Tense No. 10 Pretérito Anterior or Pretérito Perfecto

(Past Anterior or Preterit Perfect)

This is the third of the compound tenses. This past tense is compound because it is
formed with the preterit of haber plus the past participle of the verb you are using. It is
translated into English like the pluperfect indicative, which is tense no. 9. This tense is
not used much in spoken Spanish. Ordinarily, the pluperfect indicative is used in spoken
Spanish (and sometimes even the simple preterit) in place of the past anterior.

This tense is ordinarily used in formal writing, such as history and literature. It is nor-
mally used after certain conjunctions of time, e.g., después que, cuando, apenas, luego
que, en cuanto.
EXAMPLE:
Después que hubo hablado, salió.
After he had spoken, he left.

Tense No. 11 Futuro Perfecto

(Future Perfect or Future Anterior)

This is the fourth of the compound tenses. This compound tense is formed with the future
of haber plus the past participle of the verb you have in mind. In Spanish and in English,
this tense is used to express an action that will happen in the future before another future
action. In English, this tense is formed by using shall have or will have plus the past par-
ticiple of the verb you have in mind.

EXAMPLE:
María llegará mañana y habré terminado mi trabajo.
Mary will arrive tomorrow and I shall have finished my work.

The Seven Compound Tenses

25

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 26

NOTE: First, I shall finish my work; then, Mary will arrive. The action that will
occur in the future before the other future action is in the Futuro perfecto, and in
this example it is (yo) habré terminado mi trabajo.

Also, in Spanish, the future perfect is used to indicate conjecture or probability regard-

ing recent past time.

EXAMPLES:
1. María se habrá acostado.

Mary has probably gone to bed
Mary must have gone to bed.

2. José habrá llegado.

Joseph has probably arrived.
Joseph must have arrived.

Tense No. 12 Potencial Compuesto

(Conditional Perfect)

This is the fifth of the compound tenses. It is formed with the conditional of haber plus
the past participle of your main verb. It is used in Spanish and English to express an
action that you would have done if something else had been possible; that is, you would
have done something on condition that something else had been possible.

In English, it is formed by using would have plus the past participle of the verb you
have in mind. Observe the difference between the following example and the one given
for the use of the potencial simple.

EXAMPLE:
Habría ido a España si hubiera tenido dinero.
I would have gone to Spain if I had had money.

Also, in Spanish, the conditional perfect is used to indicate probability or conjecture in

the past.

EXAMPLES:
1. Habrían sido las cinco cuando salieron.

It must have been five o’clock when they went out.
(Compare this with the example given for the simple conditional.)

2. ¿Quién habría sido?

Who could that have been? (or I wonder who that could have been.)
(Compare this with the example given for the simple conditional.)

Tense No. 13 Perfecto de Subjuntivo

(Present Perfect or Past Subjunctive)

This is the sixth of the compound tenses. It is formed by using the present subjunctive of
haber as the helping verb plus the past participle of the verb you have in mind.

If the verb in the main clause is in the present indicative, future, or present perfect tense,
the present subjunctive is used or this tense is used in the dependent clause—provided, of
course, that there is some element which requires the use of the subjunctive.

26

The Seven Compound Tenses

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 27

The present subjunctive is used if the action is not past. However, if the action is past,

this tense (present perfect subjunctive) is used, as in the examples given below.

EXAMPLES:
1. María duda que yo le haya hablado al profesor.
Mary doubts that I have spoken to the professor.

2. Siento que tú no hayas venido a verme.

I am sorry that you have not come to see me.
3. Me alegro de que Elena haya ganado el premio.

I am glad that Helen has won the prize.

In these three examples, the auxiliary verb haber is used in the present subjunctive
because the main verb in the clause that precedes is one that requires the subjunctive
mood of the verb in the dependent clause.

Tense No. 14 Pluscuamperfecto de Subjuntivo

(Pluperfect or Past Perfect Subjunctive)

This is the seventh of the compound tenses. It is formed by using the imperfect subjunc-
tive of haber as the helping verb plus the past participle of your main verb.

The translation of this tense into English is often like the pluperfect indicative.
If the verb in the main clause is in a past tense, this tense is used in the dependent
clause—provided, of course, that there is some element which requires the use of the
subjunctive.

EXAMPLES:
1. Sentí mucho que no hubiera venido María.
I was very sorry that Mary had not come.
2. Me alegraba de que hubiera venido María.

I was glad that Mary had come.

3. No creía que María hubiera llegado.

I did not believe that Mary had arrived.

So much for the seven simple tenses and the seven compound tenses. Now, let’s look at
the Imperative Mood.

Imperativo
(Imperative or Command)

The imperative mood is used in Spanish and in English to express a command. We saw
earlier that the subjunctive mood is used to express commands in the Ud. and Uds. forms,
in addition to other uses of the subjunctive mood.

Here are other points you ought to know about the imperative.

(a) An indirect command or deep desire expressed in the third pers. sing. or pl. is
in the subjunctive. Notice the use of Let or May in the English translations.
Que introduces this kind of command.
EXAMPLES:
1. ¡Que lo haga Jorge!
Let George do it!

4.¡Que entre Roberto!
Let Robert enter!

2. ¡Que Dios se lo pague!
May God reward you!
3. ¡Que vengan pronto!

Let them come quickly!

5.¡Que salgan!

Let them leave!

6.¡Que entren las muchachas!

Let the girls come in!

Imperativo

27

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 28

(b) In some indirect commands, que is omitted. Here, too, the subjunctive is used.

EXAMPLE:
¡Viva el presidente!
Long live the president!

(c) The verb form of the affirmative sing. familiar (tú) is the same as the 3rd pers.

sing. of the present indicative when expressing a command.
EXAMPLE:
1. ¡Entra pronto!

Come in quickly!

2. ¡Sigue leyendo!
Keep on reading!
Continue reading!

(d) There are some exceptions, however, to (c) above. The following verb forms are

irregular in the affirmative sing. imperative (tú form only).
di (decir)
haz (hacer)
hé (haber)
pon (poner)

val (valer)
ve (ir)
ven (venir)

sal (salir)
sé (ser)
ten (tener)

(e)

In the affirmative command, 1st pers. pl., instead of using the present subjunctive
hortatory command, vamos a (Let’s or Let us) + inf. may be used.
EXAMPLES:
1. Vamos a comer/Let’s eat.

or: Comamos (1st pers. pl., present subj., hortatory command)

2. Vamos a cantar/Let’s sing.

or: Cantemos (1st pers. pl., present subj., hortatory command)

(f)

In the affirmative command, 1st pers. pl., vamos may be used to mean Let’s go:
Vamos al cine/Let’s go to the movies.

(g) However, if in the negative (Let’s not go), the present subjunctive of ir must be

used: No vayamos al cine/Let’s not go to the movies.

(h) Note that vámonos (1st pers. pl. of irse, imperative) means Let’s go, or Let’s go

away, or Let’s leave. See (m) below.

(i) Also note that no nos vayamos (1st pers. pl. of irse, present subjunctive) means

Let’s not go, or Let’s not go away, or Let’s not leave.

(j) The imperative in the affirmative familiar plural (vosotros, vosotras) is formed by

dropping the final r of the inf. and adding d.
EXAMPLES:
1. ¡Hablad!/Speak!
2. ¡Comed!/Eat!

3.¡Id!/Go!
4.¡Venid!/Come!

(k) When forming the affirmative familiar plural (vosotros, vosotras) imperative of a
reflexive verb, the final d on the inf. must be dropped before the reflexive pronoun
os is added, and both elements are joined to make one word.
EXAMPLES:
1. ¡Levantaos!/Get up!

2.¡Sentaos!/Sit down!

28

Imperativo

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 29

(l) Referring to (k) above, when the final d is dropped in a reflexive verb ending

in -ir, an accent mark must be written on the i.
EXAMPLES:
1. ¡Vestíos!/Get dressed!

2.¡Divertíos!/Have a good time!

(m) When forming the 1st pers. pl. affirmative imperative of a reflexive verb, final s
must drop before the reflexive pronoun os is added, and both elements are joined
to make one word. This requires an accent mark on the vowel of the syllable that
was stressed before os was added.
EXAMPLE:
Vamos + nos changes to: ¡Vámonos!/Let’s go! or Let’s go away! or Let’s leave!
See (h) above.

(n) All negative imperatives in the familiar 2nd pers. sing. (tú) and plural (vosotros,

vosotras) are expressed in the present subjunctive.
EXAMPLES:
1. ¡No corras (tú)!/Don’t run!
2. ¡No corráis (vosotros or vosotras)!/Don’t run!
3. ¡No vengas (tú)!/Don’t come!
4. ¡No vengáis (vosotros or vosotras)!/Don’t come!

(o) Object pronouns (direct, indirect, or reflexive) with an imperative verb form in the

affirmative are attached to the verb form.
EXAMPLES:
1. ¡Hágalo (Ud.)!/Do it!
2. ¡Díganoslo (Ud.)!/Tell it to us!
3. ¡Dímelo (tú)!/Tell it to me!
4. ¡Levántate (tú)!/Get up!
5. ¡Siéntese (Ud.)!/Sit down!
6. ¡Hacedlo (vosotros, vosotras)!/Do it!
7. ¡Démelo (Ud.)!/Give it to me!

(p) Object pronouns (direct, indirect, or reflexive) with an imperative verb form in the
negative are placed in front of the verb form. Compare the following examples
with those given in (o) above:
EXAMPLES:
1. ¡No lo haga (Ud.)!/Don’t do it!
2. ¡No nos lo diga (Ud.)!/Don’t tell it to us!
3. ¡No me lo digas (tú)!/Don’t tell it to me!
4. ¡No te levantes (tú)!/Don’t get up!
5. ¡No se siente (Ud.)!/Don’t sit down!
6. ¡No lo hagáis (vosotros, vosotras)!/Don’t do it!
7. ¡No me lo dé (Ud.)!/Don’t give it to me!

(q) Note that in some Latin American countries, the 2nd pers. pl. familiar (vosotros,

vosotras) forms are avoided. In place of them, the 3rd pers. pl. Uds. forms are
customarily used.

The Future Subjunctive and the Future Perfect Subjunctive: A note

The future subjunctive and the future perfect subjunctive exist in Spanish, but they are
rarely used. Nowadays, instead of using the future subjunctive, one uses the present sub-
junctive of the present indicative. Instead of using the future perfect subjunctive, one uses
the future perfect indicative or the present perfect subjunctive. However, if you are curi-
ous to know how to form the future subjunctive and the future perfect subjunctive in
Spanish, the following is offered:

(1) To form the future subjunctive, take the third person plural of the preterit of any
Spanish verb and change the ending -ron to re, res, re; remos, reis, ren. An
accent mark is needed as shown below on the first person plural form to preserve
the stress.
EXAMPLES:
amar

comer

dar

haber

hablar

ir or ser

amare, amares, amare;
amáremos, amareis, amaren
comiere, comieres, comiere;
comiéremos, comiereis, comieren
diere, dieres, diere;
diéremos, diereis, dieren
hubiere, hubieres, hubiere;
hubiéremos, hubiereis, hubieren
hablare, hablares, hablare;
habláremos, hablareis, hablaren
fuere, fueres, fuere;
fuéremos, fuereis, fueren

(2) Let’s look at the forms of amar above to see what the English translation is of this

tense:

(que) yo amare, (that) I love . . .
(que) tú amares, (that) you love . . .
(que) Ud. (él, ella) amare, (that) you (he, she) love . . .
(que) nosotros (-tras) amáremos, (that) we love . . .
(que) vosotros (-tras) amareis, (that) you love . . .
(que) Uds. (ellos, ellas) amaren, (that) you (they) love . . .

(3) To form the future perfect subjunctive, use the future subjunctive form of

haber (shown above) as your auxiliary plus the past participle of the verb you
have in mind.
EXAMPLES:
(que) hubiere amado, hubieres amado, hubiere amado;
(que) hubiéremos amado, hubiereis amado, hubieren amado
English translation:
(that) I have or I shall have loved, (that) you have or will have loved, etc.

The imperative is not a tense; it is a mood.

In Spanish, there are 7 simple tenses and 7 compound tenses. A simple tense
means that the verb form consists of one word. A compound tense means that the
verb form consists of two words (the auxiliary verb and the past participle). The
auxiliary verb is also called a helping verb and in Spanish, as you know, it is any
of the 7 simple tenses of haber (to have).

Summary of verb tenses and moods . . .

31

7_3559_Spanish_FM1  10/20/06  9:21 AM  Page 32

TIP

Each compound tense is based on each simple tense. The 14 tenses given on
the previous page are arranged in the following logical order:

Tense number 8 is based on Tense number 1 of haber; in other words, you
form the Perfecto de indicativo by using the auxiliary haber in the Presente
de indicativo plus the past participle of the verb you are dealing with.

Tense number 9 is based on Tense number 2 of haber; in other words, you
form the Pluscuamperfecto de indicativo by using the auxiliary haber in the
Imperfecto de indicativo plus the past participle of the verb you are dealing
with.

Tense number 10 is based on Tense number 3 of haber; in other words, you
form the Pretérito anterior by using the auxiliary haber in the Pretérito plus
the past participle of the verb you are dealing with.

Tense number 11 is based on Tense number 4 of haber; in other words, you
form the Futuro perfecto by using the auxiliary haber in the Futuro plus the
past participle of the verb you are dealing with.

Tense number 12 is based on Tense number 5 of haber; in other words, you
form the Potencial compuesto by using the auxiliary haber in the Potencial
simple plus the past participle of the verb you are dealing with.

Tense number 13 is based on Tense number 6 of haber; in other words, you
form the Perfecto de subjuntivo by using the auxiliary haber in the Presente
de subjuntivo plus the past participle of the verb you are dealing with.

Tense number 14 is based on Tense number 7 of haber; in other words, you
form the Pluscuamperfecto de subjuntivo by using the auxiliary haber in the
Imperfecto de subjuntivo plus the past participle of the verb you are dealing
with.

What does all the above mean? This: If you ever expect to know or even recog-
nize the meaning of any of the 7 compound tenses, you certainly have to know
haber in the 7 simple tenses. If you do not, you cannot form the 7 compound
tenses. This is one perfect example to illustrate that learning Spanish verb forms
is a cumulative experience. Look up haber where it is listed alphabetically
among the 501 verbs in this book and study the 7 simple tenses.

complex sentence A complex sentence contains one independent clause and one or more

dependent clauses.
One independent clause and one dependent clause:

Joseph works but his brother doesn’t/
José trabaja pero su hermano no trabaja.
The independent clause is Joseph works. It makes sense when it stands alone because
it expresses a complete thought. The dependent clause is but his brother doesn’t. The
dependent clause, which is introduced by the conjunction but/pero, does not make
complete sense when it stands alone because it depends on the thought expressed in
the independent clause.
One independent clause and two dependent clauses:

Anna is a good student because she studies but her sister never studies/
Ana es una buena alumna porque estudia pero su hermana nunca estudia.
The independent clause is Anna is a good student. It makes sense when it stands alone
because it expresses a complete thought. The first dependent clause is because she stud-
ies. The dependent clause, which is introduced by the conjunction because/porque, does
not make complete sense when it stands alone because it depends on the thought
expressed in the independent clause. The second dependent clause is but her sister never
studies. That dependent clause, which is introduced by the conjunction but/pero, does not
make complete sense, either, when it stands alone because it depends on the thought
expressed in the independent clause. See also dependent clause, independent clause.
compound sentence A compound sentence contains two or more independent clauses.

Mrs. Fuentes went to the supermarket, she bought a few
things, and then she went home/
La señora Fuentes fue al supermercado, compró
algunas cosas, y entonces fue a casa.
This compound sentence contains three independent clauses. They are independent
because they make sense when they stand alone. Review the explanation, uses, and
examples of the pretérito (Tense No. 3) on page 17. Review comprar and ir among
the 501 verbs in this book. See also independent clause.

They are el, la, los, las.

el libro/the book, la casa/the house,

The definite articles la, los, las are also used as direct object pronouns. See direct
object pronoun.

demonstrative adjective A demonstrative adjective is an adjective that points out. It is

placed in front of a noun.

this book/este libro; these books/estos libros;
this cup/esta taza; these flowers/estas flores.

I prefer those [over there]/Prefiero aquéllas.

For demonstrative pronouns that are neuter, see neuter.

dependent clause A dependent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a
predicate. It does not express a complete thought when it stands alone. It is called
dependent because it depends on the independent clause for a complete meaning.
Subordinate clause is another term for dependent clause.

Edward is absent today because he is sick/
Eduardo está ausente hoy porque está enfermo.
The independent clause is Edward is absent today. The dependent clause is because he
is sick. See also clause, independent clause.

place, or thing.

a pretty girl/una muchacha bonita; a big house/una casa grande;
an expensive car/un carro costoso.

See also adjective.

direct object noun A direct object noun receives the action of the verb directly. That is

why it is called a direct object, as opposed to an indirect object. A direct object noun is
normally placed after the verb.

I am writing a letter/Escribo una carta.

The direct object is the noun letter/una carta. See also direct object pronoun.

direct object pronoun A direct object pronoun receives the action of the verb directly. It
takes the place of a direct object noun. In Spanish, a pronoun that is a direct object of a
verb is ordinarily placed in front of the verb.

I am writing it [the letter]/La escribo.

36 Definitions of Basic Grammatical Terms with Examples

7_3559_Spanish_FM2  10/20/06  9:10 AM  Page 37

In the affirmative imperative, a direct object pronoun is placed after the verb and is
joined to it, resulting in one word.

Write it [the letter] now!/¡Escríbala [Ud.] ahora!

An accent mark is added on the vowel i [í] in order to keep the emphasis on that vowel
as it was in escriba before the direct object pronoun la was added to the verb form.
Review the Imperative section (o) on page 29.

disjunctive pronoun A disjunctive pronoun is a pronoun that is stressed; in other words,

emphasis is placed on it. It is usually an object of a preposition. In Spanish usage,
prepositional pronoun is another term for disjunctive pronoun.
for me/para mí; for you (fam.)/para ti;
con usted/with you; con él/with him; con ella/with her

Note the following exceptions with con:

conmigo/with me; contigo/with you (fam.);
consigo/with yourself (yourselves, himself, herself, themselves)

ending of a verb In Spanish grammar, the ending of a verb form changes according to

the person and number of the subject and the tense of the verb.
To form the present indicative tense of a regular -ar type verb like hablar, drop ar of
the infinitive and add the following endings; -o, -as, -a for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd per-
sons of the singular; -amos, -áis, -an for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd persons of the plural.
You then get: hablo, hablas, habla; hablamos, habláis, hablan. Review at the top of
page 15. See also stem of a verb.

masculine, not male or female.

gerund In English grammar, a gerund is a word formed from a verb. It ends in ing.

Actually, it is the present participle of a verb. However, it is not used as a verb. It is
used as a noun.

Seeing is believing/Ver es creer/[to see is to believe].
However, in Spanish grammar, the infinitive form of the verb is used, as in the above
example, when the verb is used as a noun.
The Spanish gerund is also a word formed from a verb. It is the present participle of a
verb. The Spanish gerund [el gerundio] regularly ends in ando for ar type verbs (of
the 1st conjugation), in iendo for er type verbs (of the 2nd conjugation), and iendo for
ir type verbs (of the 3rd conjugation). There are also irregular present participles that
end in yendo.

hablando/talking comiendo/eating viviendo/living

infinitive An infinitive is a verb form. In English, it is normally stated with the preposi-

tion to, as in to talk, to drink, to receive. In Spanish, the infinitive form of a verb

gation that end in -er, and the 3rd conjugation that end in -ir. In Spanish grammar, the

mood of verbs Some grammarians use the term the mode instead of the mood of a verb.
Either term means the manner or way a verb is expressed. In English and Spanish
grammar, a verb expresses an action or state of being in a particular mood. In Spanish
grammar, there are five moods (modos); the infinitive (el infinitivo), the indicative (el
indicativo), the imperative (el imperativo), the conditional (el potencial), and the sub-
junctive (el subjuntivo). In English grammar, there are three moods: the indicative
mood, the imperative mood, and the subjunctive mood. Most of the time, in English and
Spanish, we speak and write in the indicative mood.

negative statement, affirmative statement

See affirmative statement, negative statement.

neuter A word that is neuter is neither masculine nor feminine. Common neuter demon-

strative pronouns in Spanish are esto/this, eso/that, aquello/that [farther away].

What’s this?/¿Qué es esto?  What’s that?/¿Qué es eso?
For demonstrative pronouns that are not neuter, see demonstrative pronoun. There is
also the neuter pronoun lo. It usually refers to an idea or statement. It is not normally
translated into English but often the translation is so.

¿Estás enferma, María?/Are you sick, Mary? Sí, lo estoy/Yes, I am.
No lo creo/I don’t think so.
Lo parece/It seems so.

noun A noun is a word that names a person, animal, place, thing, condition or state, or

quality.

the man/el hombre,  the woman/la mujer, the horse/el caballo,
the house/la casa,  the pencil/el lápiz,
happiness/la felicidad,  excellence/la excelencia
In Spanish the noun el nombre is the word for name and noun. Another word for noun
in Spanish is el sustantivo/substantive.

number In English and Spanish grammar, number means singular or plural.

ordinal number An ordinal number is a number that expresses position in a series,

such as first, second, third, and so on. In English and Spanish grammar we talk about
1st person, 2nd person, 3rd person singular or plural regarding subjects and verbs.
See also cardinal number and person (1st, 2nd, 3rd).

orthographical changes in verb forms An orthographical change in a verb form is a

change in spelling.

The verb conocer/to know, to be acquainted with changes in spelling in the 1st per-
son singular of the present indicative. The letter z is inserted in front of the second c.
When formed regularly, the ending er of the infinitive drops and o is added for the
1st person singular form of the present indicative. That would result in conoco, a
peculiar sound to the Spanish ear for a verb form of conocer. The letter z is added to
keep the sound of s as it is in the infinitive conocer. Therefore, the spelling changes
and the form is yo conozco. In other forms of conocer in the present indicative, z is
not inserted because the sound of s is retained.

There are many verb forms in Spanish that contain orthographical changes. Review the
verb conocer in the present indicative tense among the 501 verbs.

passive voice When we speak or write in the active voice and change to the passive

voice, the direct object becomes the subject, the subject becomes the object of a prepo-
sition, and the verb becomes to be plus the past participle of the active verb. The past
participle functions as an adjective.

participle ends in ing. In Spanish a present participle is called un gerundio.

cantando/singing  comiendo/eating  yendo/going
Review pages 3 and 4 for regular and irregular present participles and their uses. See
also gerund.

el hombre/él
the man/he

la mujer/ella
the woman/she

reflexive pronoun and reflexive verb In English, a reflexive pronoun is a personal pro-
noun that contains self or selves. In Spanish and English, a reflexive pronoun is used
with a verb that is called reflexive because the action of the verb falls on the reflexive
pronoun. In Spanish, there is a required set of reflexive pronouns for a reflexive verb.
Pablo se ha afeitado.
Paul has shaved himself.

afeitarse
to shave oneself

lavarse
to wash oneself

(Yo) me lavo.
I wash myself.

Review, for example, the reflexive verbs afeitarse, lavarse, levantarse, llamarse
among the 501 verbs in this book to become familiar with the reflexive pronouns that
go with reflexive verbs in the three persons of the singular and plural.

regular verb A regular verb is a verb that is conjugated in the various tenses according
to a fixed pattern. For examples, review page 15 at the top and page 16 at the bottom.
See also conjugation, irregular verb.

relative pronoun A relative pronoun is a pronoun that refers to its antecedent.

The girl who is talking with John is my sister/
La muchacha que está hablando con Juan es mi hermana.
The antecedent is girl/la muchacha. The relative pronoun who/que refers to the girl.
See also antecedent.

sentence A sentence is a group of words that contains a subject and a predicate. The verb

is contained in the predicate. A sentence expresses a complete thought.

The train leaves at two o’clock in the afternoon/
El tren sale a las dos de la tarde.
The subject is train/el tren. The predicate is leaves at two o’clock in the afternoon/sale
a las dos de la tarde. The verb is leaves/sale. See also complex sentence, compound
sentence, simple sentence.

simple sentence A simple sentence is a sentence that contains one subject and one predi-
cate. The verb is the core of the predicate. The verb is the most important word in a sen-
tence because it tells us what the subject is doing.

Mary is eating an apple from her garden/
María está comiendo una manzana de su jardín.
The subject is Mary/María. The predicate is is eating an apple from her garden/está
comiendo una manzana de su jardín. The verb is is eating/está comiendo. The direct
object is an apple/una manzana. From her garden/de su jardín is an adverbial phrase.
It tells you from where the apple came. See also complex sentence, compound sentence.

singular Singular means one. See also plural.
stem of a verb The stem of a verb is what is left after we drop the ending of its infinitive
form. It is needed to add to it the required endings of a regular verb in a particular verb
tense.

Infinitive
hablar/to talk
comer/to eat
escribir/to write

Stem
habl
com
escrib

Ending of infinitive

ar
er
ir

See also ending of a verb.

stem-changing verb In Spanish, there are many verb forms that change in the stem. The
verb dormir/to sleep changes the vowel o in the stem to ue when the stress (emphasis,
accent) falls on that o; for example, (yo) duermo. When the stress does not fall on that
o, it does not change; for example, (nosotros) dormimos. Here, the stress is on the
vowel i.
Review the present indicative tense of dormir among the 501 verbs.

subject A subject is that part of a sentence that is related to its verb. The verb says some-

thing about the subject.

Clara and Isabel are beautiful/Clara e Isabel son hermosas.

subjunctive mood The subjunctive mood is the mood of a verb that is used in specific
cases, e.g., after certain verbs expressing a wish, doubt, emotion, fear, joy, uncertainty,
an indefinite expression, an indefinite antecedent, certain conjunctions, and others. The
subjunctive mood is used more frequently in Spanish than in English. Review the uses
of the subjunctive mood with examples on pages 20 to 23, pages 26 to 27, and page 30.
See also mood of verbs.

subordinate clause Subordinate clause is another term for dependent clause. See

dependent clause.

Verb Drills and Tests with Answers Explained

The hundreds of verb forms in this part of the book will immerse you in the prac-
tice and improvement of your knowledge of Spanish verb forms, tenses, and uses.
You will find a variety of types of questions to make your experience interesting,
challenging, and rewarding. All verb forms used in the drills and tests are found
in the preliminary pages, among the 501 verbs, and in the back pages of this
book.

The answers and explanations begin on page 78. The explanations are brief
and to the point, including references to pages in this book for study and review.

Tips: To figure out the correct verb form of the required tense, examine each sen-
tence carefully. Take a good look at the subject of the verb. Is it 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
person? Is it singular or plural? Is it masculine or feminine? Look for key ele-
ments that precede or follow the verb to determine the verb form and tense, for
example, such words as yesterday, last week, today, at this moment, tomorrow,
next year, a preposition, a certain conjunction, and other key words that indicate
the need for an infinitive, present participle (gerundio), past participle, or the
indicative or subjunctive moods in the required tense. The correct verb form
depends on the sense and grammatical structure of the sentence.

The best way to learn irregular forms in the seven simple tenses is from study,

practice, and experience. For the information of present and past participles,
including irregulars, consult pages 3 to 6. As for the formation of regular verb
forms, consult pages 14 to 32. For an easy way to form the seven compound
tenses in Spanish, consult page 92 from time to time.

Answers to Verb Tests with Explanations

Test 1

B, and D are in the preterit.

ject hombre is 3rd person singular. Review the other forms of saber (verb 423)
in A, B, and C.

lloviendo in B. Review pages 4 and 5. Review llorar (verb 300) and llover, a
defective verb on page 660.

4. B The 1st person singular, future, of ver is needed because future time is implied
in the word mañana. You are telling José, “I will see you tomorrow.” Choice A
is 3rd person singular, future. Review the forms of ver (verb 489).

5. A A form of estar is needed because a temporary state or condition is indicated in
the sentence: Mary is pale. Review the uses of estar on pages 345–347. As for
the other choices, review the forms of estar (verb 230) and ser (verb 438).

6. B Here, too, a form of estar is needed because a temporary state or condition is

beginning on page 346, specifically in (c) (1). Review the forms of estar (verb
230). Review the forms of ser (verb 438) in A, C, and D.

7. C You are dealing with the verb acostarse. You need the infinitive form

acostarme in C because of the preceding preposition a. The me in acostarme
is needed because voy (I am going) is stated. Review the examples in section A
on page 669 where ir, a verb of motion, requires the preposition a + inf.
Review the forms of acostarse (verb 21) in choices B and D.

8. A You must know the idiomatic expression tener ganas de + inf. As for tuvo in

C, it is preterit, 3rd person singular. Study the forms of tener (verb 468). As for
quiero in B, study querer (verb 390). Regarding choice D, pago is a form of
pagar (verb 341).

Review the other forms of morir (verb 319) in choices A, C, and D.
12. C According to the meaning of the sentence, you are dealing with the verb deber

(verb 159). The other verbs in A, B, and D would make no sense in this sen-
tence. Review verbs 134, 326, and 390.

13. B A form of estar is needed because a temporary state or condition is indicated in

the sentence: the store will be closed. The future tense is needed because
mañana (tomorrow) is stated. The subject la tienda is 3rd person singular and

78

7_3559_Spanish_FM2  10/20/06  9:10 AM  Page 79

so is the verb estará. Review the uses of estar (verb 230), in particular, the

the books. The 2nd person plural familiar form of vosotros is needed because
the teacher talked to her pupils in the familiar form. Review abrid in the
imperative as well as the other forms of abrir (verb 4).

15. C The form puedo (1st person singular, pres. ind.) is the correct choice because
right after it is divertirme and they must agree in person; in other words, the
statement is saying, “I can enjoy myself.” Review poder (verb 363) on pages
494 and 495 for the forms in choices A, B, C, and D.

16. C You need to complete the perfecto de indicativo (Tense No. 8) by selecting the
past participle traído because han is given as the helping verb. The sentence is

singular of the presente de indicativo in A. Review the other forms of pagar

choices A, B, and D.

in (e) at the top of page 16. Review the pretérito of telefonear (verb 463).

6. A And here, too, you need the imperfecto de indicativo of mirar (verb 314).

Study the explanation and examples in (f) on page 16. Also, review the forms
of mirar in choices B, C, and D.

7. A You need the infinitive form of venir (verb 488) because in front of it there is a

verb form (quiere). Robert says that he wants to come to my house. Review
verbs that take no preposition + infinitive in section K, beginning on page 676.
On page 677 querer + inf. is listed. Also, review the other forms of venir in
choices B, C, and D.

8. C You must complete the perfecto de indicativo tense by using the past partici-

ple visto because the helping verb has is stated in front of the missing verb
form. Review this tense of ver (verb 489) and the choices in A, B, and D. Also
study the irregular past participles on page 6.

9. A You need the imperfecto de indicativo of querer (verb 390) because you are
dealing with an indirect quotation in the past. Casandra said that she wanted to
come to my house. Compare this sentence with the one in number 7 above.
Study the explanation and example in (g) on page 16. Also, review the other
forms of querer in choices B, C, and D.

10. C The adverb ayer (yesterday) tells us that the verb is in the past. The subject is

amigo (friend), 3rd person singular; therefore, the verb must be 3rd person sin-
gular also. Choice C is 3rd person singular in the pretérito of llegar (verb
297). Review the other forms of llegar in choices A, B, and D.

11. B The adverb anoche (last night) tells us that the verb is in the past. The subject

is María, which is 3rd person singular; therefore, the verb must also be 3rd
person singular. Choice B is 3rd person singular in the pretérito or ir (verb
280). Review the other forms of ir in choices A, C, and D.

12. B Ayer por la tarde (yesterday afternoon) tells us that the verb is in the past. The

statement asks what happened in the street. Review the forms of pasar (verb
347) in the presente de indicativo (choice A), the pretérito (choices B and C),
and in the futuro (choice D). Also, check out example 3 at the top of page 17.
13. B According to the sense of the sentence, the verb must be in the past. The sub-

ject is yo, 1st person singular; therefore, the verb must also be 1st person singu-
lar. Review the pretérito of tomar (verb 473) in choices A and B, as well as
the choices in C and D.

14. C The two verbs in the sentence (salí and tomé) are in the pretérito. The missing
verb form must also be in the same tense and person because of the sense indi-
cated in the statement. Review the forms of llegar (verb 297), salir (verb 426),
and tomar (verb 473). Also, check out example 5 at the top of page 17.

15. B Because of the subject yo, you need the 1st person singular of conocer (verb

134) in the pretérito. According to the sense of the statement, la semana pasa-
da (last week) indicates a past tense. Review the other choices of verb forms of
conocer. Also, examine example number 1 in the middle of page 17.
16. C You are talking to José and are using the familiar tú form of the verb in the 2nd

person singular. You are asking him when he found out the truth. The only tú

17. A The subject is yo. You need the futuro, 1st person singular of hacer (verb 260)

because la semana que viene (next week) is stated. Review the futuro and
pretérito of hacer. Also, review the uses and formation of the future tense, with
many examples, on pages 18 and 19.

18. A The subject is nosotros. You need the futuro, 1st person plural of ir (verb 280)
because el verano que viene (next summer) is stated. Review the other forms of
ir in choices B, C, and D.

19. C Mary say that she will come tomorrow. The futuro of venir (verb 488) is need-
ed in the 3rd person singular because María is 3rd person singular. Review the
forms of venir among the other choices. It would make no sense to use the
pretérito of venir in A and B because mañana (tomorrow) implies future time.
Also, review the uses of the future tense on page 18, in particular example (c),
and the formation of that tense on page 19.

20. B If Miguel had money, he would go to Spain. The only conditional form of ir

(verb 280) is in B. A and C are future tense. D is the present tense. Review the
forms of ir. Also, review the uses of the potencial simple (conditional) with
examples on page 19, in particular example (a).
Let’s look at the dependent clause in this sentence: Si Miguel tuviera dinero . . .
(If Miguel had money . . .). The form tuviera is the imperfecto de subjuntivo
(Tense No. 7) of tener (verb 468). That form is used because si (if) introduces
the clause. Typical examples in English of this sort of thing are the following: If
I were king, if I were you, he talks to me as if I were a child. These are contrary to
fact conditions. Review the uses and formation of the imperfecto de subjuntivo,
with examples, on page 23, in particular, the example at the top of page 24.

Test 5

1. B Review the explanation and examples of the use of gustar (def. and imp.) and

the usual forms of the verb, as well as the examples that follow.

2. A The subject tú agrees with the verb asistes because they are both 2nd person

singular, present indicative. Review the other tenses of asistir (verb 74).

3. A Review the explanation and use of hace + length of time in example (f) on

page 14, and with the verb hacer (verb 260).

4. A The use of empieza is in the question, as well as in the answer. Study the forms
of empezar (verb 205) in choices A, B, C, and D. Note that the second e in this
verb changes to ie when it is stressed. Also, z changes to c when the vowel e
follows it.

5. C You need the infinitive form venir because a verb form (puedes) precedes it.
Review verbs that take no preposition + infinitive in section K, beginning on
page 676. On page 676, poder + inf. is listed. What you are saying to Dolores
is “You can come” (You are able to come). Review the forms of venir (verb
488) in choices A, B, C, and D.

6. C You are telling Dolores, “Then, let’s go to my Spanish class.” Review the forms
of ir (verb 280) in the four choices, giving special attention to vamos (let’s go)
in the imperative near the bottom of that page. When you are not sure of the
translation into English of a Spanish verb tense, review pages 11 and 12 where
there is a sample English verb conjugated in all the tenses.

on pages 3 and 4 so that you may be able to form the progressive present and progressive
past.

Test 16

the uses of estar on the pages following that verb. Also, the infinitive form
estar is needed because debe is a verb that precedes the missing verb form.

The Spanish Alphabet and the New System of Alphabetizing

The Association of Spanish Language Academies met in Madrid for its 10th Annual
Congress on April 27, 1994 and voted to eliminate CH and LL as separate letters of the
Spanish alphabet.

Words beginning with CH will be listed alphabetically under the letter C. Words begin-
ning with LL will be listed alphabetically under the letter L. The two separate letters his-
torically have had separate headings in dictionaries and alphabetized word lists. Spanish
words that contain the letter ñ are now alphabetized accordingly with words that do not
contain the tilde over the n. For example, the Spanish system of alphabetizing used to
place the word andar before añadir because the ñ would fall in after all words contain-
ing n. According to the new system, añadir is placed before andar because alphabetizing
is now done letter by letter. The same applies to words containing rr.

The move was taken to simplify dictionaries, to make Spanish more compatible with
English, and to aid translation and computer standardization. The vote was 17 in favor,
1 opposed, and 3 abstentions. Ecuador voted “no” and Panama, Nicaragua, and Uruguay
abstained. (The New York Times, International Section, May 1, 1994, p. 16).

Acabar

Acabar is an important verb to learn because it is a regular –ar verb and because
there are many everyday expressions related to it.

The Spanish idiomatic expression acabar de + inf.
is expressed in English as to have just + past
participle.

Present Indicative:
When you use acabar in the present tense, it
indicates that the action of the main verb (+ inf.)
has just occurred now in the present. In English,
we express this by using have just + the past
participle of the main verb.

Examples:
María acaba de llegar.
Mary has just arrived.

Acabo de comer.
I have just eaten.

Acabamos de terminar la lección.
We have just finished the lesson.

Imperfect Indicative:
When you use acabar in the imperfect indicative, it
indicates that the action of the main verb (+ inf.)
had occurred at some time in the past when another
action occurred in the past. In English, we express
this by using had just + the past participle of the
main verb.

María acababa de llegar.
Mary had just arrived.

Yo acababa de comer.
I had just eaten.

Acabábamos de terminar la lección.
We had just finished the lesson.

Words and expressions
related to this verb

el acabamiento completion

acabar con to put an end to

acabar en to end in

acabar por to end by, to ... finally

acabado, acabada finished

Note: When acabar is used in the imperfect
indicative + inf. (of the main verb being
expressed), the verb in the other clause is
usually in the preterit.

Example:
Acabábamos de entrar cuando el teléfono

sonó.

We had just entered the house when the

telephone rang.

Proverb

Bien está lo que bien acaba.
All’s well that ends well.

Haber

Haber is an essential verb for beginning students of Spanish. You need to be able
to conjugate haber in order to form the compound tenses. In other words, if you
can conjugate haber in the simple tenses, you can form any other verb in the com-
pound tenses! The verb haber is used as an auxiliary (helping) verb as follows:

Compound tenses

Example (in the 1st person sing.)

Present Perfect (or Perfect) Indicative
Pluperfect (or Past Perfect) Indicative
Preterit Perfect (or Past Anterior)
Future Perfect (or Future Anterior)
Conditional Perfect
Present Perfect (or Past) Subjunctive
Pluperfect (or Past Perfect) Subjunctive

he hablado (I have spoken)
había hablado (I had spoken)
hube hablado (I had spoken)
habré hablado (I will have spoken)
habría hablado (I would have spoken)
haya hablado (I may have spoken)
hubiera hablado or hubiese hablado
(I might have spoken)

For an explanation of the formation of these tenses, see pages 31, 32, and page 92.

The verb haber is also used to form the perfect (or past) infinitive: haber hablado (to have
spoken). As you can see, this is formed by using the infinitive form of haber + the past participle
of the main verb.

The verb haber is also used to form the perfect participle: habiendo hablado (having spoken).

This is formed by using the present participle of haber + the past participle of the main verb.

The verb haber + de + inf. is equivalent to the English use of “to be supposed to...” or “to be

to...”: María ha de traer un pastel, yo he de traer el helado, y mis amigos han de traer sus
discos compactos/Mary is supposed to bring a cake, I am supposed to bring the ice cream, and
my friends are supposed to bring their CDs.

Note on hay and hay que + inf.
The word hay is not a verb. You might look at it as an impersonal irregular form of haber.
Actually, the word is composed of ha + the archaic y, meaning there. It is generally seen as an
adverbial expression because it points out that something or someone “is there.” Its English
equivalent is There is... or There are... For example: Hay muchos libros en la mesa/There
are many books on the table; Hay veinte alumnos en esta clase/There are twenty students in
this class.

Hay que + inf. is an impersonal expression that denotes an obligation and it is commonly
translated into English as: One must... or It is necessary to... Examples: Hay que estudiar para
aprender/It is necessary to study in order to learn; Hay que comer para vivir/One must eat in
order to live.

Sentences using haber and related words

No hay rosa sin espina.
Every rose has its thorn. (There is no rose without

a thorn.)

Donde hay humo, hay fuego.
Where there’s smoke, there’s fire.

Hacer

Hacer is an essential irregular verb for beginning students of Spanish. It is used
in many everyday situations and idiomatic expressions. Hacer is especially
important for weather expressions.

¿Cuánto tiempo hace que + present tense...?
(a) Use this formula when you want to ask How long + the present perfect tense in English:

¿Cuánto tiempo hace que Ud. estudia español?
How long have you been studying Spanish?

H

(b) When this formula is used, you generally expect the person to tell you how long a time it has

been, e.g., one year, two months, a few minutes.

(c) This is used when the action began at some time in the past and continues up to the present

moment. That is why you must use the present tense of the verb—the action of studying,
waiting, etc., is still going on at the present.

¿Hace + length of time + que + present tense
(a) This formula is the usual answer to the question ¿Cuánto tiempo hace que + present tense...?

(b) Since the question is asked in terms of how long, the usual answer is in terms of time: a year,

two years, a few days, months, minutes, etc.:

Hace tres años que estudio español.
I have been studying Spanish for three years.

(c) The same formula is used if you want to ask how many weeks, how many months, how many

minutes, etc.:

¿Cuántos años hace que Ud. estudia español?
How many years have you been studying
Spanish?

Proverbs

¿Desde cuándo + present tense...?
¿Desde cuándo estudia Ud. español?
How long have you been studying Spanish?

Present tense + desde hace + length of time
Estudio español desde hace tres años.
I have been studying Spanish for three years.

De decir a hacer hay mucho

que ver.

There is a great difference between

saying and doing.

El ejercicio hace al maestro.
Practice makes perfect.

No dejes para mañana lo que

puedes hacer hoy.

Don’t put off until tomorrow what

you can do today.

Don’t forget to study the section on defective and impersonal verbs. It’s right after this main list.

7_3559_Spanish_253_501  10/20/06  9:03 AM  Page 382

¿Cuánto tiempo hacía que + imperfect tense?
(a)

If the action of the verb began in the past and ended in the past, use the imperfect tense.

(b) This formula is equivalent to the English How long + past perfect tense:

¿Cuánto tiempo hacía que Ud. hablaba cuando entré en la sala de clase?
How long had you been talking when I entered the classroom?

(c) Note that the action of talking in this example began in the past and ended in the past when I

entered the classroom.

Hacía + length of time + que + imperfect tense
The imperfect tense of the verb is used here because the action began in the past and ended in
the past; it is not going on at the present moment.

Hacía una hora que yo hablaba cuando Ud. entró en la sala de clase.
I had been talking for one hour when you entered the classroom.

¿Desde cuándo + imperfect tense...?

¿Desde cuándo hablaba Ud. cuando yo entré en la sala de clase?
How long had you been talking when I entered the classroom?

Imperfect tense + desde hacía + length of time

(Yo) hablaba desde hacía una hora cuando
Ud. entró en la sala de clase.
I had been talking for one hour when you
entered the classroom.

Pensar

We think that pensar is a very useful verb for you to learn. It is used in a great
number of idiomatic expressions and everyday situations. Pay attention to the
stem change in Tenses 1 and 6 and in the imperative mood.

Pensar is used with the preposition de when
you ask someone what he/she thinks of someone or
something, i.e., when you ask for someone’s opin-
ion: ¿Qué piensa Ud. de este libro?/What do you
think of this book? Pienso que es bueno/I think
that it is good.

Pensar is used with the preposition en when
you ask someone what or whom he/she is thinking
about: Miguel, no hablas mucho; ¿en qué pien-
sas?/Michael, you are not talking much; what are
you thinking of? (of what are you thinking?);
Pienso en las vacaciones de verano/I’m thinking
of summer vacation.

Saber

Saber is a very useful irregular verb for you to know. It is used in a great
number of idiomatic expressions and everyday situations. Don’t confuse
saber with conocer (verb 134).

Generally speaking, saber means to know a fact,
to know something thoroughly:

¿Sabe Ud. qué hora es?/Do you know what
time it is?
¿Sabe Ud. la lección?/Do you know the
lesson?

When you use saber + inf., it means to know how:

¿Sabe Ud. nadar?/Do you know how to swim?
Sí, (yo) sé nadar/Yes, I know how to swim.

In the preterit tense, saber means to find out:

¿Lo sabe Ud.?/Do you know it?
Sí, lo supe ayer/Yes, I found it
out yesterday.

Sentences using saber and related words

Este niño no sabe contar.
This child can’t (does not know how to) count.

No sé nada de este asunto.

Gustar

Gustar is an essential regular –ar verb for beginning students of Spanish. It is used in many
everyday expressions and situations. Please note that this verb is commonly used in the third person
singular or plural, as in the examples below.

(a) Essentially, the verb gustar means to be pleasing to...

(b)

(c)

(d)

In English, we say, for example, I like ice cream. In Spanish, we say Me gusta el helado; that
is to say, “Ice cream is pleasing to me (Literally: To me, ice cream is pleasing).”

In English, the thing that you like is the direct object. In Spanish, the thing that you like is the
subject. Also, in Spanish, the person who likes the thing is the indirect object: to me, to you,
etc. For example: “A Roberto le gusta el helado/Robert likes ice cream (Literally: “To Robert,
ice cream is pleasing to him).”

In Spanish, therefore, the verb gustar is used in the third person, either in the singular or plu-
ral, when you talk about something that you like—something that is pleasing to you.
Therefore, the verb form must agree with the subject; if the thing that is liked is singular, the
verb is third person singular: Me gusta el café/I like coffee. If the thing that is liked is plural,
the verb gustar is third person plural: “Me gustan el café y la leche/I like coffee and milk
(Literally: Coffee and milk are pleasing to me).”

(e) When you mention the person or the persons who like something, you must use the preposition

a in front of the person. You must also use the indirect object pronoun that is associated with
the person: A los muchachos y a las muchachas les gusta jugar/Boys and girls like to play.
(Literally: To boys and girls, to play is pleasing to them.)

Sentences using gustar and related words

Me gusta el café. I like coffee.

Me gusta leer. I like to read.

Te gusta leer. You (familiar) like to read.

Me gustan la leche y el café. I like milk

and coffee.

A María le gustan los dulces. Mary likes

candy.

A José y a Elena les gustan los deportes.

Joseph and Helen like sports.

Nos gustan mucho las películas policíacas.

We like detective movies very much.

Me gustaría un pastel. I would like a pastry.

Basic guide to Spanish pronunciation

The purpose of this guide is to help you pronounce Spanish words as correctly as
possible so you can communicate effectively. It is not intended to perfect your
pronunciation of Spanish; that is accomplished by imitating correct spoken
Spanish, which you must hear from persons who pronounce Spanish accurately.
Latin American pronunciation is generally the same as you will hear in many
regions of Spain, but there are some areas where Castilian pronunciation is domi-
nant. For example, the letter c before e or i and the letter z are pronounced th, as
in the English word thin, and the double (ll ) is similar to the sound in the English
word million. This is something you should be aware of in case you are visiting
those areas of Spain where you will hear those sounds.

The simple rule of stressed vowel sounds in Spanish is as follows:

1. When a word ends in a vowel, n, or s, you must stress the vowel that precedes
the last vowel or final syllable. For example, you should stress the first sylla-
ble in casa and comen, but you should stress the second syllable (-me-) in
comemos because the word ends in the letter s and -me- is the next to last
syllable.

2. When a word ends in a consonant other than n or s, you must stress the last

vowel in the word. For example, you should stress -lor in calor, -bril in abril,
-roz in arroz, and -lud in salud.

3. When the pronunciation of a word does not follow the above two rules, you
must write an accent mark over the vowel that is stressed. The only way to
know this is to hear the word pronounced accurately so you will know
whether or not an accent mark is needed. For example, the last syllable of
jabón is stressed, even though you would expect the stress to fall on the vowel
that precedes it. That is why there is an accent on –bón. The word árbol has
an accent over the a in the first syllable because normally one would stress the
vowel in the last syllable. However, the stress falls on ár- instead of –bol.

An accent mark is written over a vowel at times to distinguish the meaning

between two words that are spelled identically. Examples:

sí (yes)
si (if)

él (he)
el (the)

ése (that one)
ese libro (that book)

In some Spanish-speaking countries, the simple vowel e is at times pronounced

open or closed and it can sound like ay in the English word say or eh as in the
English word egg. In other countries, the final s in a word is not pronounced. This
does not mean that one pronunciation is wrong and the other is correct. These are
simply regional differences that have come about over decades and centuries of
change. In fact, the meaning of a particular word may sometimes vary from place
to place.

Now, become familiar with the following pronunciation guide. Remember that

the approximate pronunciations in English serve only as a guide to pronouncing
the Spanish.

Index of common irregular Spanish verb
forms identified by infinitives
The purpose of this index is to help you identify those verb forms that cannot be
readily identified because they are irregular in some way. For example, if you
come across the verb form fui (which is very common) in your Spanish readings,
this index will tell you that fui is a form of ir or ser. Then you look up ir and ser
in this book and you will find that verb form on the page where all the forms of ir
and ser are given.

Verb forms whose first three or four letters are the same as the infinitive have
not been included because they can easily be identified by referring to the alpha-
betical listing of the 501 verbs in this book.

After you find the verb of an irregular verb form, if it is not given among the
501 verbs, consult the list of Over 2,100 Spanish Verbs Conjugated Like Model
Verbs, which begins on page 707.

English-Spanish verb index
The purpose of this index is to give you instant access to the Spanish verb for the
English verb you have in mind to use. This saves you time if you do not have a
standard English-Spanish dictionary handy.

When you find the Spanish verb you need, look up the form of the model verb
that has a similar conjugation (e.g., to alarm is alarmar, which is conjugated like
verb 54, which is amar). If there is no verb number listed (e.g., abrir) that means
that the Spanish verb is one of the 501 model verbs. If you see “Def. and Imp.”
instead of a verb number, look in the list of defective and impersonal verbs. It’s
right after the main verb listing.

The preposition to in front of the English verb has been omitted.

English-Spanish verb index

7_3559_Spanish_Appendix  7/27/07  5:54 PM  Page 707

Over 2,100 Spanish verbs conjugated
like model verbs
The number after each verb is the page number in this book where a model verb
is shown fully conjugated. At times there are two page references; for example,
sonarse (to blow one’s nose) is conjugated like sonar (verb 445) because the o in
the stem changes to ue and it is like lavarse (verb 289), which is a reflexive -ar
type verb, as is sonarse. Don’t forget to use the reflexive pronouns with reflexive
verbs. Consult the entry reflexive pronoun and reflexive verb in the section on
definitions of basic grammatical terms with examples beginning on page 33.
If you see “Def. and Imp.” instead of a verb number, look in the list of defective
and impersonal verbs. It’s right after the main verb listing.

Note: The English definitions are a guide to the most common meanings. In some
cases we have also included a preposition when it is likely that you will use it
along with the verb. There are obviously many more definitions for the verbs in
this list. Think of the definitions as a way to make sure that you’re looking up
the right word!
